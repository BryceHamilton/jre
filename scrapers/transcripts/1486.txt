 Hello, friends, welcome to the show. This episode is brought to you by Woop.  Woop is a fitness wearable that I have been wearing for more than a year and I'm a big fan.  They sponsored our last year sober October challenge, but more importantly, it changed the way I think about the data that I can get from a fitness tracker. First of all, tracks your sleep, which is very important for me because sometimes I like to bullshit myself and.  I like to pretend that I slept eight hours, but I really slept six hours and 40 minutes, I'm like, oh, that's why I'm like a little bit dragging.  And it gives you, like, real clear numbers. There's a thing called a sleep coach. It'll even tell you how much you've recovered from the night before and tell you what time you should go to sleep.  Like if you plan on waking up at seven a.m., it'll tell you what time. Hey, hey, hey, hey, buddy. You should go to sleep by this time so that 7:00 a.m. is reasonable. You've had enough sleep, it'll give you a strain. Coach tells you how much you know how much effort you put forth in your workout.  And it's all based on heart rate variability.  It's really amazing.  I'm like me, Bert, Krischer, Tom, Sagara, Ahsha affairs kind of fucked up. He didn't really stick with the program.  But Bert, Bert and Tom and I, we talk about it all the time.  We still, long after sobre October, use the woop tracker.  It's fucking great man or woman or whatever you are.  It tells you so much in terms of data about heart rate variability.  What's your resting heart rate, heart rate, heart rate, what it is when you're really exhausted, how much you've recovered while you've slept.  It's really powerful.  What it what it does is it monitors you 24/7, it gives you an amazing insight into how your body actually works and it'll just let you know, like with real data, how you're doing.  You know, it kind of bullshit yourself. But Woop. Is there to send you to real dear?

I've been friends with these folks for a long time, we did the End of the World show at the Wiltern Theatre in Los Angeles with the great and powerful Doug Stanhope and the goat, Joey Diaz. We all did a show in December 21st, 2012.  Well, here we are, almost eight years later in the world. Still here. What the fuck? But these guys are awesome. These these people, these humans. I love them to death.  Please give it up for Ben and Suzanne of Honey Honey Girl podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience Train by Joe.  Good podcast. My night all day.  And it seems that way if you just start pitching theme song, you can do that. Really? Yeah. Cool. Yeah. And we're rolling.  We're rolling right now. Yeah.  Honey, how did the band get back together. Is it literally the band is back together like you know that expression you say with your friends bro. The band's back together.  Yeah. I never said that shit. Yeah.  The band's back together band, the band's bassist. Bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam, bam.  I just like to say like did is he something I'm a bam bam bam bam bam. Yeah. Yeah.  So band's back together started via covid.  Oh we, we're kind of mad at each other is what binds us. Yeah. We're a little mad at each other across this country together.  And then I got really sick, I got really worried about being the person I live with.  Thought we maybe did have covid at a time. It turns out he tested negative but he had acute laryngitis at the same time.  So we're just like, oh, she like all those other diseases, don't take a break. Like, oh, Calvert's greatest nodine and bronchitis, no acute laryngitis.  Well, either way, I was like, real mad at you at the time. And I was like, I really love Ben. And I'd be really bummed if I didn't if there weren't a Ben and I. And then we started talking, hanging out. Sometimes that's all it takes.  You know, we all get set in our ways.  You get these grudges and these stupid things stick in your the best shit, not worth broderie, not friendship and love. That's the best shit. It's like whatever you kind of do. And most people want that. If you ever felt that for someone at one point in time, you probably would feel it again is whatever shit you have together, you just got to talk it out, talk it out and don't carry grudges. And grudges is the worst.  Well, we had to we needed to step back for a minute. Yeah, we had to do it ourselves.  And like, you know, we took two years to really where we didn't speak much at all. And when we did show some balls of steel from the old drawing board that lives in infamy.  That's an inside story, huh?  God, how once in a while being himself. Yeah. What if it was us, whoever it was the whole time you were right, you had to be talented. The video he sent was you guys do an Angel of death accoustic on the roof of a building in L.A. so crazy. They're just our building is right now on fire.  Probably rightfully so. Oh, my God. God damn it. Yeah.  When we were practicing last night, there was an earthquake. Oh, Jesus.  And I was just like watching, like, my living room kind of.  And I looked at and I was like, fuck no. What that was like.  Laryngitis doesn't stop the earthquake. It's like God saying, bam, just a little one, bam. Or that's why I don't say bam. Could have been entities could have been saying a lot is God invented all languages and all things. Yeah. All the bad words. God invented those two. God invented racial slurs.  So we have to work it out. Oh you left us with the word invented all its.  It's really mean we need to find a good one for white people. You really need to balance this out. Yeah. Good. A good juicy solid one. Is Karens carrying a weight. What's the white one.  Brocke Chalke. Chadds probably feels sure.  Yeah. A lot of poor Bradlees but there's some good Bradlees like what's that.  Bradley. The actor Bradley Cooper. That he's a really good actor. Super great. So you can't be a Bradley. Mm.  But there's a lot of cool chaps. Yeah. Brad Pitt. Sorry, there's a lot. Chad Ward, Chad Dawson. It's a lot of great boxers named Chad.  Yeah. Shit. Yeah. You can't even go Chad.  I don't know Jamie. What you turn it around and say shit, he's got a girl's name. What are you going to do. Hey, nothing wrong with that. Just open that comment down. Yeah. Nothing wrong with that gender. You deal with that my whole life, bro. I'm sure you didn't want to listen. You know I love you, Jamie. Spell it that way. You know I love you.  I mean, you could see a different way with girls. Is JMI with Zoe? Most of them start with the I. Before she was really pissed off.  Stacy's roommate name a boy. That's true. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Leslie's gonna tell.  I'm on the kid, it's like a boy named Sue, it's Johnny Cash song, Johnny Cash wrote a goddamn song about it.  Shel Silverstein wrote that. Oh, oh, that's right. That's right. And Johnny Cash song has a great fucking song, Truth.  That's a great song. Like I like boy names for girls. I think that always like Bobby or Billie, if they're hot, they can pull it.  Yeah, yeah. I've Gary, Gary, Gary. I want if I, if I ever procreated and I do that to a little kid. Yeah. But she'd be like the fucking coolest Gary on the planet. That's one thing.  She would probably get over people fucking with a real early in life, you know what I mean. Because sometimes yeah. If you don't know. That's not how the song went though. No.  You can't tell then it didn't work out. But who knows what Gary's going to be dealing with in 15 years.  It's going to be crazy shit hair.  She's going to be she's gonna be good on that. I am not ready to have children, so. Well, then that is. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  The one thing that the kids zealots like to do is they like to pretend that everybody needs to have kids in order to be valuable in this life.  You need to have kids. That's so interesting. A lot of fucking pressure on kids that a thing.  Sure. It's you know what it is when someone's doing something, they think you should be doing it right. Like you talk to someone who just started meditating in the church. That's me. I can never shut the fuck up about what I like doing. Yeah. Yeah. I'm always trying to get people to do things. Yeah. You know, that's the thing with people. With kids. Are you you got.  Yeah. You got to have trust me. You've got to know where she lives. What are you doing. You know children, you're not going to procreate your name aren't going to carry settle down.  That's resonated with me like a legacy of like because you don't have a pin. I know, but like as you know. But even with my career, like I, I just won't play music like I don't really think about like what's going to last when I'm dead.  There's nothing wrong. You're a great person. There's nothing wrong with any way of approaching this life. Have children, don't have children, sing music, don't sing music. You can do whatever the fuck you want.  You and I do. And you do appreciate that, friend. Listen, friend. Yeah, but this thing that I have to keep pressure on, folks that they have to have kids are their life is not valid and rightfully probably because they're having trouble dealing with the pressure of having kids.  Maybe, maybe. But it's all silly because you don't live forever. No. One, your children won't live forever. No one lives forever. You live, you die. You got to keep moving while you're alive. You should be happy. Yeah. Just be happy you're contributing.  Everyone's contributing. Whether you have kids or don't have kids.  When you don't have kids, you have the option to love and support the kids in your peripheral area, like my nieces and nephews and stuff and my friends, kids.  And then you can go home and you don't have to deal with the other shit.  Yeah, sure. So, you know, but then, like, selfish me, it was a strong education, education in humanity, just learning how to be a person, a different kind of person, a person that raises little people, person that's responsible for four babies. It's a totally different feel.  It's like every person who it fucks with your head, you know, it's just for a lot of people creates a ton of anxiety and. Right. Existential angst and fear about the future.  Well, the thing is, if I were to have kids, I would like being a mother would be like the No.  One, like nothing comes before then. And, you know, I would I would take that seriously.  And it's just something that, you know, when you think about and I'm like like now's the time.  But, you know, am I allowed to ask a little. Yeah, yeah. I'm thirty five. You can still pull it off. I don't I don't age shame. You know, I'm really happy where I'm at.  I think that's so funny when people get really squeamish about that, like well they feel like they only have a certain amount of time to grab that lightning in a bottle and be validated. And, you know, some people just think. That you've got to it's going to burn out quick and the life is going to suck, right? You know, somebody shamed me once and was like, you're almost 40. And I was like, what's wrong with 40?  Because this online now. That sounds like a YouTube kind. Unfortunately, that was in real life. Seems so that. Yeah. A guy, you know. Yeah. Oh, rude.  How weak. But I mean, again, why would someone do that to try to make you feel bad. Because they don't feel good. That's what it is. It's always the case. It's no one who feels great is on top of the world.  Dalai Lama is out there, not out there leaving shitty YouTube comments. What if he was, though?  He was secretly like, did you ever see the video of the guy? I don't know if you know this, but he got canceled for a little while. No. What did he do? Yeah, the Dalai Lama got canceled.  Yes, yes, yes. I bet he was fine. He did this. And we are he was actually talking about this exact same subject. He did this interview. Well, they said, you know, you you're celibate. And have you ever thought about being married or having children?  Goes, Oh, I've seen a lot of marriages, much worry, much cancer.  And he goes, plus, when they break up a woman, get all the money, just like joking around and and in the ladies, like, what the fuck?  This is the Dalai Lama, you know?  And then she goes she actually tries to social justice her way out of it because, you know, she's she got to confront him. She was actually sometimes the woman makes her own money.  Oh. And he's like, oh, a good one. But, you know, sometimes they just put him in time out for a minute.  People are saying, should we cancel the Dalai Lama? It was really funny. It was really funny.  He's like, you can't see people. He goes, then I see him like a couple of years later, a new person, new girlfriend, much worry, much cancer.  Still holding that line. He talks about how women want to spend all the guy's money.  I'm like, oh, this is hilarious. But has he had a girlfriend? No, I don't think he maybe doesn't know about that stuff much. It's guesswork.  You should tell it straight. Guesswork. Yeah. Yeah. I don't think that's part of the word. Yeah, yeah. They tell me know life is a strange life.  You know, they picked him when he was a baby. He was a little kid. Right. He was a little kid. They picked him and they said, you're the fucking man bro. Imagine that when the last one died, he was really young. I think he was the last one dies.  They pick a new one. Yeah, they have a slate of little babies. They're like, yeah, but you could be.  You could be. How how is that monitored. They just have a vibe is like a council of is there that and you put a bunch of names in it or is it like I, I'm not there but I haven't seen it done.  Is it required that he's celibate? Is that part of the gig.  Imagine that. It's so real. Yeah. Because it's Prince. You come to me in my fifties. Yeah. Why do you want to come to me as a holy man when I was seven. Yeah. You don't have the choice. You cut off the sex at seven. Never weight.  Well, no they don't. OK, sorry I misinterpreted.  I'm saying I'm not old enough to have sex. I didn't think so. No one said I was like something. I don't know.  Rude way to tell me. It's not like they ever put it on. I mean, there was no it was already a baby.  Yeah, that's right. Yeah, it's already attached. Yeah. Oh.  Now I'm thinking about the jolly woman's.  What year did they pick the Dalai Lama. Never thought that would. I know. I didn't either.  First time we share a birthday I think I should tell you all is that's the truth. That's crazy.  You might be like six people. Those people are 1884. I share my birthday. I said, oh yeah, it's the same job.  Also conscious stream as a consciousness stream. You know, I was last night that I haven't seen really I don't think I ever saw it through. It was Zoolander. Oh, it's so good.  It's so good. So ridiculous. Who am I. It's so ridiculous. Not a great idea.  A it's like a super vapid, beautiful man. Oh, it's so good in one of those really slapsticky silly comedies. There's so much truth to it though.  That's the part. And enjoy the shit out of it. Yeah.  You you new male models. When you were doing male modeling, you were doing male modeling.  You do male modeling, right or wrong, for recorded years when I was a male model news grenade. Things have changed now.  I did. I did. Yeah. There's, there's, I mean it's kind of like she's my words carefully here.  There's a thing I think modeling in general is a very odd thing.  If I was a model from 14 to like 18 and looking like the Dalai Lama, they just chose, you know, I, I went for it and my mom, like, took me to this agency and I was like making money when I was, you know, I had like I was just like working every every other week for, like, value city department stores, anyone for my Clevelanders.  That and eventually I kept getting, you know, I never saw it is like the end all be all I. I wanted the bridge to something else as I figure it out, like where my area of entertainment was.  I was an actor for a while, but, you know, if that's all you got. You're just sort of like paid to look beautiful, like there's something really fucked up about that, like it's not a healthy mindset. And I saw lots of eating disorders and all kinds of really sad shit that, like, you know, people's identities are wrapped up in this.  And I remember I, I. I gained a little weight when I was 18 because I went on birth control and they I was in the middle my agency, and they were measuring me in front of people and they were like, you got to lose two inches.  And and it's a fucking hard thing. And I just quit. I started bartending. I didn't I didn't want that badly.  And I like pizza. That's such a weird thing to say. I know.  It's really it's really. It's so specific. Yeah. Look what we found to be two and a half. Well, you know, it's a close family, I think. I mean, I don't think fighters, though, right? Well, no.  I mean, I didn't mean to compare, like, the way they use the same training as a model.  All right. All right. Rescinded.  But no, it is a thing where you're both relying on your body entirely for your living, you know, and there's a lot of people involved, though.  And for women, I would imagine women already women already worry about being marginalized for their brain anyway.  So then it's almost like some of them feel like they have to prove themselves extra because they happen to be pretty and they're a model and people just assume they're a moron.  Right. That's an issue, too. Yeah, it's an issue.  I mean. Yeah, but no, but there's also people to figure it out as girls do it than they do other shit. Yeah.  There you go. Yeah. But it's like when that's why I get kind of annoyed when people talk about any job being inherently toxic bulk. A lot of jobs have the potential for toxicity.  Everything including like, you know, fucking everything, all of them, all jobs could fuck you up, all jobs could distort your percent. I mean, how about being a cop? You that fucking distort your perception about being a doctor, emergency room doctor every day. Bullet wounds, stab wounds, car accidents, dealing with that every day, that that shit's got to be bad for you. That kid can't be good for your head 100 percent. I'm talking about losing two inches.  Well, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, OK, I'm not going OK.  I'm not going to get my you know, the doctor's up 14 years old. That's a difference.  Oh, you're only super hot, not super duper hot. Jesus, no. How do you do it. Like how do you get a lower level for sure.  Like there was I was like catalog I well you know, I mean I know what I mean.  It's all kind of crazy, right. You just get this amazing roll the dice with your bone structure and then everybody here's some money.  You like what I have to do for this. Yeah. But there you have to do anything to get it to dance like a monkey. Derinda Well, you got to be smart with it. You got to know what it is. I know that there's a there's an expiration date on it. What do you do with the money you make? What are you going to do with any the you know, like that's how I started acting and I loved it.  You know, it's kind of crazy, though, if you really stop and think about it like that, that is like the biggest lottery in life for a lot of folks is how do you look? You know?  Yeah, like if you're Jason Momoa, it's amazing what a good guy. It's amazing. He's a good guy. Yeah.  Because he's too beautiful. Yeah, he's too good. Look, you know, he was sitting next to us at the Sturgis concert.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. He was on he was on one side and then Johnny Bernthal, the Punisher was on the other and he was like one of the best days of my life haha.  Well it was cool. I enjoyed that very much. I don't get to see concerts like that.  It was so great and you know and did go to see it with you. That was really fun. We had song we had to put together. Yeah. Where was the show. It was at the Troubadour.  The Troubadour was awesome and it was the Fire and Fury, this new show and it is doing.  Yeah but he's also doing a lot of stuff from his old, his old catalog too. So it was just it was awesome. It was real intimate. Like what does that 400 people or something.  The five stuff, we sold it out once. We know it was like one of the greatest moments of honey, honey and also one of the great venues in L.A. It's a double decker, but it's still intimate.  You know, it's really rare in the way the way it's set up.  I mean, it's sort of amazing. Like where we were was incredible up above. When you're in that little balcony area next to the Punisher.  Oh, I think a lot of my intensity that we talked about this, I think I told you this, but when we went to dinner afterwards, John Prine was right in front of us.  And I really, really wanted to tell him how much I loved his music. And I chickened out.  Yeah, I remember we were talking about it. I didn't know who he was. This was the first time I ever heard of them. Yeah. So, yeah.  And then when I heard he died from covid, I was like, oh that's that dude.  He Dand, you know, he's worth checking out and like really, really digging into who he was.  And Sergio loved him. Yeah. He's magical, beautiful songwriter, beautiful.  Can you remember like a specific famous song that people would write Angel from Montgomery. What's the one. Do it.  Can you do it if you want to mess it up.  So what Ben, can you pull up? You could do it. Listen, one of the best when the best music shows I've ever seen in my life is when you guys were on stage with Gary Clark and you were singing midnight. Right?  There's right now I don't get crazy.  We had that chick got pulled off the pancake or whoever owns it. Yeah. When that happens more than three times, the cancer, your fucking account. Yeah, OK, this might be. Look at that. Oh, there you go. Oh, my God. Is that good? This was a I do the Bonnie Raitt.  I don't know what she doesn't, but which is fun. Yeah, OK. Yet, forgiver, we're finding the key, it might be weird because, I mean, people are fine with this. Don't worry about this. They love the weirdness, like people love seeing how musicians put together a song named after every like you just talking to hire.  And then you jump into an awesome song and excited about pressure.  Oh, there's no pressure in the best way. Like it's good for you. I know my heart is racing. I could have a whiskey.  Explain this whiskey again then that whiskey.  Uncle Nereus, this guy named Nathan Green was, at least to my knowledge, the first recognized master distiller who was an African-American, taught Jack Daniel's how to do his thing, freed slaves after civil after the civil war.  And this is the whiskey you brought and that's. Thank you very much. 1856.  I said, OK, I was.  I got it.  Yeah, OK, is that back who is singing that version of Bonnie Raitt? Bonnie Raitt. Yeah, that lady.  I am a woman named after my mother. Oh, man is another child this morning. Oh, James Thunder and Lightning was desired. This old house would have burned down a long time ago. Big picture, the flies from Montgomery. Made me a poster of. Yo. Just give me one thing I want to. Leaving this living hard to wait for the right job Prime.  Oh, wow. You will have to work that out in a fuller version, but there's more to it.  You want to keep going? Well, you want to play big man. Let's keep. OK, keep. This is so good luck. All right. I love Big Man, too. I want to hear that next. All right.  When I was a young girl and I had me a cowboy. He was a marshal again, just a free man. That was a long time, no matter how I try. Those you just blown by like a broken down hill. Maybe just the size. Maybe a poster of. Just give me one thing I can hold on to you to believe in this, this is a hard way to go. You leaving this living is a hard way to go.  That was beautiful. That was really beautiful.  You give a great song, Machinery, 100 percent over that song 100 percent, but I mean, like said, you did, but you should put that on something that was awesome. We got to do it for you. I thought you were to a Spotify.  We will do it for you. I'm not even saying it's not even the prince. You're the king jester.  Whatever humble man you want to be, man, since we're like, oh, you're a tune up, though, because it's chilly in here.  Is it chilly in here? You want to come a fiddle point? I mean, and this isn't live. No, OK, but we're not. Okay, okay, okay, well, shit, I'm that crazy that, you know how whether it's warm or cold, based on the strings, based on you running that thing. What is that thing called the wand?  It's a lot better than what it's called. What's it's called. It's called the wand. It's called the bow. Isn't really the bow, of course, being on the fiddle. Yeah, but it's made it a horse. I'm going to call it a one.  No one sounds better. Right. Is that music one. Because I've always wanted to be a wizard. You kind of are.  I was.  I was when I was watching this one thing on Tick Tock where they had this girl who was a witch, and they said, you know, we want to know, like, have you actively coerced the police officers and have you have you curse the looters? And she was like, oh, yeah, we've already done that.  We've already paid taxes on all of them. We're good, right? Like there's active witches on the road to check. Check. I mean. Well, I want to I have comments on that.  Comments on witches, no more intentions.  I'm like, what a spell is. And like the way that people orchestrate that, it's kind of just OK for the powerful.  Like it's like prayer in a way like this. Answer to it. Yeah, but it gets weird.  Well, we all want people to like us and all some of us do is not like you ferociously and that can make you upset.  But I'm not talking about negative spells I'm talking about, but I'm just saying that's the beginning of it. Right. Know if someone has a lot of intention and they put intention on you like having a terrible life or you getting diseases and.  Yeah. And you hear about that. It probably fucks with your head.  I mean, that's what voodoo is probably all about for sure.  And for all intents and purposes, I think there are ramifications if that is the trajectory, if you're like really like putting bad vibes into something.  Yeah. You come back in a really shitty way, but they only do it because their life sucks.  I think people that do shit like that, they do it because their life sucks.  Let's hope they're like better. Let's do that. Let's give them the tools for them. Actually, no, this is for we're going to put Big Man. Yeah, yeah. We want to do this. This is for them. No, no, no.  I don't know what but I know yeah. We want to take this to George for it because you know, his nickname was Big Floyd or Big right. Yeah. I didn't obviously didn't know.  Well not all the lyrics line up, but it does. It's an homage to a great man who. Who passed originally, and it just feels apropos to do it now. Yeah, yeah, cool. Can you fix me a little bit? I could actually. And they still booking their plane, what they say. I am playing Greystar. He took that like cocaine off. But I think clamping down by the River Ríordáin. There was a trimline poll and they came for a while to, you know, whether people should.  They were broken, well, they drank, obviously, but. Happy that he's gone. Bonds, Barry Bonds, Barry Bonds, al-Sheik now lay to sleep and he looks down, oh, he looks up.  He was a good man. There was enough. But at. Happy that he's gone. No show, no, no, no know this stuff has been going on lately. Yeah, you know, it's coming on dedicating it to George Floyd went through on.  Yeah. Yeah. Everybody obviously intense time.  I think ultimately society needed this, that they didn't need that guy to die, but they needed this event to snap out of whatever whatever bullshit relationship, particularly the black community has with police in the videos that have come out since of police officers doing shit while this is all going on during this, like it's like they have a they have a pattern.  Some of these cops, they can't break out of it. They're used to treating people like shit. They used to violently assaulting people. Yes.  The directive, there's so much of it. There's so much crazy shit of guys using batons on women just standing there, the girls just standing there. And he's using the baton on the front of her thighs and throws her on to the ground like fucking come on, man, how are you doing this?  Because someone won't comply, like the position of being a person that gets that that has that kind of power over people where people have to comply to you is just psychologically fraught with peril.  You know, whether it's black people, there's a lot of it doing. If white people there's a there's a horrible video, my friend Joe Shilling's page, you know, Joe showing the kickboxer, he's got a page on his Instagram he's been putting post after post is police brutality shit. Post after post. It's like, is this to serve or protect?  And this is his old man and the guy has a camera and the cops are slamming into him with their shield and he goes flying and falls and hits his head on a bike rack.  It's fucking horrible.  It's horrible. All I mean, there's that is that has been going on.  Yeah. It's been going on in the black community. Clearly, we have a shitload of evidence that's been going on with all kinds of people. Yeah, it's it's an overall problem. There's a racism component to it. Yeah. But the problem is police brutality.  Yeah.  I was reading about so 40 percent of police officers have sleep disorders and PTSD, so they're just constantly 40 percent of police officers have sleep disorders and admit to error on the job, i.e. falling asleep in their cruisers, violent acts, anger issues.  And, you know, a lot of times I'm trying to understand as much as possible because it's so fucking sensitive and you need to apply the same rehabilitative mindset to the police force as people are calling for and communities of color as well.  Obviously, it has to be a joint. Yes. Look, they have to do something. Yeah.  And something has to be done to psychologically address what the real consequences of seeing violence and murder and horrible, horrible things every day.  Every day. There's got to be there's a cycle. There's a price you're paying.  If that's what you're doing with your life, like you're you open the door. Guy killed himself to shotgun. Oh, Jesus. Just brain splatter all over the wall. Open the door. There's a girl was raped and stabbed. Oh, Jesus Christ. You know, open the door. There's someone who just overdosed from fentanyl. They're eighteen years old. That's what you're seeing all day long. You're just always, like, fucking die.  And then the solution isn't to just pay them more like, oh, here, here's hazard pay or. Well, my friend Dakota Meyer.  Dakota Meyer is a guy who served overseas and had some horrific instances where he literally had to fight a man to the death and kill him with a rock, you know, and Jesus.  Yeah, yeah. Heavy shit. They talked about it on the podcast.  I was like, fuck, you know, it's like this guy because they were in war. The guy was the enemy and he had to kill a bunch of guys that day and save his friend. It's a crazy story that's best told by him. But anyway, point is, he was talking about this shot that they're doing on soldiers with PTSD.  It was some kind of a blocker shot. You remember that shot, Jamie? I could text him if we have to, but they give it to soldiers and people with PTSD and whatever that anxiety is, all that fucking pent up shit that just you just can't be normal.  It goes away and it can last for as long as a year.  But it gives you that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There is shit is the shot.  It's called There's Got to be where it's administered by health care professionals into the neck of an individual screen suffering from PTSD. The treatment is not a cure for PTSD. He was talking about how amazing it was. He was saying it was he wrote the second article there. It said something about prolonged relief for the debilitating symptoms. Yeah, it's it's not a cure. However, it's highly effective, well tolerated, fast acting, inexpensive biologic technique that provides prolonged relief from the debilitating symptoms of PTSD.  See, I just start doing that instead of, I think, a brand new thing. Yeah, yeah. I think it's pretty recent, but I also think that you like your brain when it encounters a lot of things that are awful. I think it really alters the chemistry of your brain. I think it really alters your ability to make good decisions. So you could you can make a real rational case that they're almost intoxicated. Yeah, yeah.  100 percent when they're running on adrenaline. Right. When you see these cops, do you see when they were clearing out the square for Trump to have his Bible follow up? You got cops slamming into people like how do they get that ramped up that they're doing that?  Could you ever do that? Would you just walk right up to someone and slam them with a shield? Of course you wouldn't. But you have to.  Guys are terrified to. Obviously, the cops are terrified for sure. But you have to get to a point where you can do that, right.  There's something has to happen, whether it's a biologic drug that your body is producing. And these guys are junkies.  They're adrenaline. I mean, literally, like I told you about the therapy I just did.  This is like what I've been trying to, like, weed out of my life is my insomnia and get my my brain levels and my you know, I've just been running on adrenaline. And now that I'm, like, leveling out, it's so weird to live. I can I can function better.  I can process my stress in a way that I never could for over a decade.  And, you know, the reason I was I was reading about Sarah is that I think they did this study. I'll send it to you at some point. We could probably post it.  But, you know, the the conditions that police officers are under physically, like from night shifts just to stress to what you said, opening the door and seeing all these just horrifying things and not having the therapeutic elements and rehabilitation, and then you factor in racism or just discrimination like I mean, it is it's a lethal combination. And it's so crazy to just see it like we are every day now.  It's just all out in the open.  And now it's like, what do we do to help these people, like, get to the point, the place that they're supposed to be, which is protecting us and.  Well, you got to clean house. Yeah, you got to clean house. You got to go in there and you've got to get rid of anyone who exhibits any sort of behavior like that in any way, in any abusive. You can't have any abuse because you have an extraordinary ability to control people. You're not allowed a normal person is not allowed to treat people like that. So for you to be able to do that, you have to show that you're an unusual person, you're a powerful person because you can control it.  You can be a good person even under the pressure of conflict like life or death, conflict on a daily basis. That's not a normal person.  And by the way, when these guys are in it, fifteen, twenty years, like, how fucking sick are they by twenty years and how unprepared are they when they've been training for six months and boom, done.  You're out on the street. How about a day on their. There are a lot of cops, a lot of cops sign up for law enforcement when they're fucking eight years old. Crazy.  We're not even fully formed. Exactly. Exactly like that. That in and of itself, you get like a big, strong kid, you know, and I'm primarily speaking about men. You know, I'm sure women could do it, too. But like, it's different and, you know, their brains are not fully formed and then their life is in. Your your life is in their hands. Yeah. Like what? Well, yeah.  Another thing that came out of this whole covid thing and then with this coming afterwards, it's like when when you're dealing with perpetually, perpetually crime ridden neighborhoods like they've had crime in them forever.  And a lot of these neighborhoods are African-American neighborhoods that have had like whether it's the south side of Chicago or outside of Baltimore, like when you see how the government can spend so much money bailing out corporations that are fucked.  Right. But they don't bail out cities that are fucked. But, you know, hold on. You knew Baltimore was fucked.  It's like no one had any questions whether parts of Baltimore were just fucked. In fact, it was laws they used to line.  You weren't allowed to buy a house in certain areas if you were an African American. So we know that. Yeah. So how come you bail out corporations? You never bailed out these inner cities.  It would have cost a fraction to set up community centers, build more.  Much better affordable housing, because leadership is too short sighted for that, and that's like a spiritual deficit.  But what's crazy is they all want to pretend that they're pro-American. If you are pro-American, you would want less losers.  You would want more people that have an opportunity to get out of bad circumstances. And whatever those bad circumstances are, you'd want to keep people safe.  Even if you're always going to run into bad circumstances with people that have drug addictions or people, you're not going to cure all that.  That's a human issue. Humans are crazy. You're not going to stop broken families and all that stuff. That's just a part of being a person.  But you can do a way better job protecting people from crime, a way better job of insulating them from drug deals and all that crazy shit once shielding them or integrating people in a healthier way into an economic system that addresses their needs.  You know, and but that's what we're so vulnerable from from a leadership perspective. Yeah.  Yeah.  Because of lobbying and because of just like a natural instinct to of self protectionism and like, well, I got to make sure that my family is taken care of first and not the cornerstone speech that color might encourage people to read.  Did you guys read that? I seen it. It's it's really intense. And, you know, it was written by name is escaping me like a confederate. Yeah. OK, the vice presidency is the president or vice president of the Confederacy. And like for all intents and purposes, like the first half of the of the speech was like pretty logical in terms of commerce and how to care for your cities and like, you know, just, you know, economics.  And then he just gets down to this part where he talks about African-Americans is like, you know, they're subhuman, like they're not they're not actual. Like, it's just so clear cut and dry in his mind that the superior race is white. By God, he was quoting the Bible and like like thousands and millions of people.  Millions of people. Like, followed that ethos, and that doesn't just go away, you know, so like in terms of red lining, when people want to know why, you know, ghetto's, it's so hard to get out of the ghetto. You know, like this has been made by design.  And even further back, just the thought that, like, yeah, black people are the slaves, like they're beneath us. So they need to be in their place. And like, it's just nuts, like to read this speech. It was. And to think about how many people were behind it. And that's what we're up against, even though it was three or four hundred years ago that it was six hundred eighteen.  Fuck. Well, it's weird walking. Yeah, cool. And 80 year olds being adults in twenty twenty. Right. And not having anything to do with anything that happened. An eighteen hundreds. But you walk into the wake of, of that era and to the echo of that era.  It's not that long ago, not 150 years ago there was one hundred, fifty two years ago there were slaves. That's crazy.  I know that's not even the blink of an eye. It's a blink of an eye. Not that long. Yeah.  And what's really crazy is like we we have a thing that we do with Native Americans. Right. We kind of acknowledge that our settler, the European settlers, the original great, whether they're your relatives or not, mine aren't mine all came third. I'm third generation. So my family arrived in the 20th century. But the people that arrived earlier than that, like if your family goes all the way back to sixteen hundred, just some fucking Native American blood on your hands.  Yeah, just this is if you get well, my father was in the railroad business. Oh. How did he get that fucking railroad through the country. You had to kill some people man.  Yeah like yeah. So the United States is kind of acknowledged that they fucked up and they gave the Native Americans reservations. That was the whole idea is like you can have your own laws, you can make casinos, you can do wild shit.  You do it all right here. OK, we're just going to leave you alone. Yeah, but it's it's real slippery, right?  Well, you know, that's a false did on the other. Oh, they started finding, you know, wealth on their lands.  Then they got I just I just read this book called Killers of the Flower Moon, which is just a horrifying thing that happened in our history that is not well known with the Osage Native American tribe in Oklahoma.  And they were all forced onto this reservation and it turned out to be millions and millions of dollars rich in oil.  And then all of the members of the tribe were given had rights.  And they every year all these white people would come in and they would they would like rent their land basically for for oil rigs. And they each member of the tribe had millions of dollars, but the the government didn't recognize them as full citizens, so they were given stewards to manage their wealth. So a lot of them are living in poverty while they're fucking babysitters. We're robbing them, murdering them.  And the whole book is about a series of murders and also how the FBI was, oh, my God, damn.  The FBI. The FBI. Yeah.  So damn these fucks Hoover use this as his platform because but the sad part is there was like three dudes that went to jail for killing like twenty five people.  One, they weren't given they weren't put to death because no white jury could kill them for for killing Native Americans because they weren't considered full human. They like to picture that.  It's crazy, it's insane and it's heartbreaking. And it really echoes what's going on now with the way that that black people are treated. It's like people didn't give a fuck about Native Americans and like and then they got rich and then they're like, let's fuck them again, you know, like, let's make sure that they like we can still steal from them.  Like, it's horrifying. But the thing is, there's no there was no justice for their murderers. And there were so it was like a coup. There were just so many people that would come in and marry an Osage tribe member and murder them just to get their head.  Oh, my God. Yeah, it's no, I was it mostly chicks murder and do knows it was everything poisoning that thing. There's a lot of poisoning I got.  What is this, James. The new this book was optioned into the new Martyn's.  No shit. Holy shit. You just did.  You just decided on the Joe Rogan. Wow. Appletini.  Well I think it's also the I think it's a pretty old book. Yeah. It's not that but they just. Yeah, I just picked it up at my parents. It's amazing.  I was Martin Scorsese, DeNiro and DiCaprio. I'm going to say that because I'm gonna say Bam is teardowns.  Wow. That's amazing.  The things that I did, I really got into a big, long stretch of being fascinated with Native American history from a book somebody recommended to me called Empire of the Summer Moon about the Comanche and.  It's really like why Texas is the way Texas is, Texas is the way Texas is, mostly because they fought off the focus of the conflict.  Yeah, the people that had to Mexico was so sneaky.  Mexico was telling white people to move to Texas. They look at my friends. It's a good place.  They tricked these people into moving into Texas because it was a buffer between them and the Comanche they wanted. But the Comanche were the fucking wildest, most ruthless band of Indians and the most successful out of all the all the West.  It took hundreds of years to conquer them. They're the reason why people didn't make it all the way to California sooner when they would go to the plains, the Comanches would fuck them up in the fuck. And that book is fascinating. Yeah, it changed my life, changed my perspective of what happened in the West. Like you realize that there was some people that came over here from somewhere in the neighborhood of between 11000 and 5000 B.C. They made it across the Bering land bridge from Asia into America.  They were basically the same kind of people that lived in Siberia and they were Stone Age when they got here.  They weren't even on horseback and they lived that way for thousands and thousands and thousands of years, exactly the same way. And it wasn't until the sixteen hundreds they started riding horses and then they started dominating motherfuckers. Wow. It was like this giant shift and who they were before, they were like really unsuccessful in war. They had no history. They had no songs. They had no stories, very little artwork. All they did is like eat rats and squirrels and whatever they could kill and barely scratched by and stayed alive.  But they figured out how to ride horses first.  They figured out how to control horses better and they figured out how to steal other people's horses because the life was so hard, there was so scratch and claw that they were ruthless. So once they got horses, they were just these wild, little scrappy motherfuckers who would run, run these horses around and kill everybody.  And they figured out how to shoot off horses. And the white people didn't know how to do that. Yet the white people would get off the horses and go, hey, let's wait, wait, wait, wait.  We got to get in line. You stand there and then I'm sorry. They were shooting like an arrow a second. They like things are riding on the horses, fucking these dudes up. And so no one, until they figured out how to make a revolver, until they figured out a way, a gun that shoots more than once because those muskets weren't cutting it right.  Like they just kept getting fucked up. That's all over birth. It was all during that time.  The Texas Rangers were the first to incorporate the revolver against the Comanche.  They the Texas Rangers became the Texas Rangers because of this fucking unbelievably ruthless tribe of Indians that dominated the area. So these dudes, instead of being like regular soldiers, adopted the way of the Comanche, they wore buckskin clothes.  They slept without fires. The Texas Rangers. Yeah, yeah. They were fucking savages out savage the Comanches.  A lot of the FBI agents that were commissioned to find the killers in the Osage murders, they were ex Texas Rangers.  Plus, it's an amazing Chuck Norris TV show. What the heck? What Lonesome Dove. Come on. Come on. You ever get into Lonesome Dove?  I know now you're never going to tell us.  This is an incredible book. I mean, about two retired Texas Rangers, but it's just like a classic Western novel.  I actually have it on audio book. I haven't gotten around to it. I will once I watch all the Texas Rangers first and then we do we have any deadwood here.  Anybody Deadwood bothered me. No sward so much. They swore so much. I was like white, real. Oh, no, it's not how they look back.  It's got a theatrical element. It's a little like Shakespeare in a way, but.  Yeah, but it was. Oh, thank you for checking in.  I love you. Thanks. I'm not. I'm supposed to drink slowly. You'll be fine. Enjoying the money, my friend. He's my friend because we're on the Joe Rogan podcast and I don't want to be a fucking dickhead.  You're not going to be. But don't hinder yourself either. Well, I haven't drank in a month. I'm sensitive. You look fine. Everything's going great.  Oh, God bless you. Everything's fine. She's back.  Don't don't you not drinking on purpose. Just give you some advice.  There is that therapy. And this is like my my months up I can get I can start living again, but I brain's in a good place. No life without alcohol.  This is good alcohol. Let me tell you, it's pretty hard not to drink this month. I'm sure it's been anything quite clear.  Yeah, well but I said because of coronavirus alcohol consumption was up and then because of these riots and all this, I'm sure it's up again another notch. Oh yeah. The looting and the riots and people breaking into people's homes and shit.  But you have vulnerable people just slammed every step of the way. Well, we've got to get through this as a race. I think having a big moment, like if we need a correction, we definitely needed a correction. We still do. We need to be we need to we need so many. Correct. We need a correction in terms of our thought on war or thought an international conflict, the way we treat each other, we need corrections, all that, but it takes a big event sometimes to make it.  Yeah, I mean, it's a restructuring of how we we view each other. But you also have to be careful of bad players. There's a lot of bad actors in these things that step in.  They want you know, they want to take advantage of people and they want people to comply with their ideology. And they try to push things and say, if you don't go along with this, you know, we know where you stand. We know where you are, you're on the other side and you get forced into some weird compliance. You're going to be real careful about that because, again, it's sort of the same thing you see with bad cops when people have power over people, even if it's just psychic power, when people have power over people, they abuse it.  We'll have a revolution after revolution. You look at the French Revolution or something like that, you know, they tear it down in the name of liberty and then they're just killing people left and right. So it's you know, there's a pattern that we can examine.  But I think it's important to not you know, obviously these events are catalyzing, but we don't. What we need to take from the event is that we don't need an event. We have to integrate this stuff.  Well, I think we need an event like what we had along with accountability.  And this is the strange thing about the culture we're living in.  A 17 year old girl was there when when George Floyd died. Right. So a 17 year old girl, cell phone camera changed the world. That's real. So this poor little girl has to deal with. Imagine being a 17 year old black girl watching a man get a knee put on his chest while he's asking that will, please let me please. I can't breathe. And, you know, that guy died and you filmed it and your video gets uploaded in the world just explodes.  There are fucking there's protests in Tokyo, protest in Berlin.  People are all over the world protesting the New Zealand our friends style band. It was in one in New Zealand on the other side of the planet. People aren't asleep anymore. Not asleep anymore.  Well, I mean, some people. Yeah, but she had a great response to. Did you see that again she came after and saying, why didn't you do more in that moment? And she had a really cogent and wonderful response about, you know, just contextualizing it.  The man people just there's too many people. If you say people say this or people say that, people tell you, eat your foot, you know, they'll tell you, you have to eat your foot if you want to be on this game.  Well, people are staying with the drinking. Yes. You know, bleach or whatever. People did that and.  Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, they didn't. They didn't. To morons drank the wrong form of hydrochloric clean. That is actually a pond cleaner. It's for fucking coupon's. These dipshits had it in their garage and they're like this.  Those are the claw. Did they that one guy died and there's a problem and one guy looks crazy.  Theory. Sorry for your hat on. That's not funny. They were here's the problem. They were passionate. They were big time Democrats. That's why does it make sense? And they were one of them was a Democrat candidate contributor, I believe.  Make sure that's right. I want you to know that.  And people like me, you guys are just you know, you're not supposed to do that.  Like, you just think you had magically had this stuff laying around. Yeah.  Oh, but I wasn't talking about the I mean, it's just it's a random thing where it sounds the same and it's real. It's hydroxy chloroquine versus some other kind of chloroquine.  You just there wasn't some like agenda here. That's just seems like hi, I'm sorry. I don't want it for you. It could be I don't want to disrespect the dead almost dead like.  Yeah, it could be somebody killed somebody.  Yeah. No, lots of weird things happen.  I don't know what the truth is anymore. I have no idea.  But why would a person who's like a staunch Democrat listen to anything that Trump has to say about taking a medication? You know, like fuck that guy, nothing about them.  Fuck that guy. I'm taking heroin.  I'm an idiot, not a good friend of ours.  For the Trump Bible photo, my friends, our friend said Trump holds the Bible like a guitar player who doesn't know how to play guitar.  I said he was like a dirty diaper bag. I said it was like a dirty diaper.  Like, what do I do with this? Get this fucking thing out here looking up.  What a stupid fucking.  He did that on purpose. Like he decided to go do this as a press like like some sort of condition is it's. But that's the dumbest publicity opportunity ever.  Like you you literally used. Do you know that one of the members of the military stepped down, a military adviser who who's the guy that stepped down? There was a guy that stepped down today. No, no, no. Different guy stepped down because of that stunt, because of that publicity stunt. He stepped down because he said that the abusive use of force that they use to clear out that square so Trump could come in for that photo op, he's like, I I can't be a part of this.  Yes, that's what we need. That's what you need. Videos.  We need accountability. And that video, whether he knows it or not, is evidence because, look, we know there's a fucking protest there.  What it did, they all go away and shut. Because you're awesome the fuck out of here, you did something you did something to people that were peacefully protesting and you didn't care that maybe he didn't even know there was some shit that I tweeted today to.  It's been proven that they used a certain type of tear gas. That is you're not supposed to use on people. No, it's like laws like find it on my here. I'll pull it up on Jimmy Stewart.  He's to me, he's like he's going to be like a folk legend. Donald Trump is like he's like the Paul Bunyan of narcissism.  It's like you don't I mean, it's like so far beyond what is understandable from a human to human.  Like, yeah, he's like a superhero of narcissism. There's a sense it makes perfect sense.  There's a guy who resigned. He resigned today because of the way Trump cleared out that plaza.  I was reading it today on the on the Google News gig, it's you know, these videos are there, right? Can't do that to people. And why are they doing that? To be able to do that to people? Because they shouldn't be cops. OK, I have a question and answer.  No, no, no, no. It happened just today. Military adviser resigns right there. Photo op right there. No, no. Above that. Above that. No, just two days. That's two days ago, though.  That's it, though, Jamie. I know, but this isn't he didn't resign. It's OK.  In my Google News feed, it showed up today for whatever reason.  Sometimes you get a Google News feed story for similar reasons. But go back to that article when it bothered you, because it's that's pop up thing on it. Oh, you can't get out of there trying to get a better one.  It's only JJB did mention you guys are talking about a drum set. I don't know if he sounds right when we get here.  Bands like you do want to you should have a drum set. Why don't. He said what? I just I'm like, why I drugs is not in any of the people that don't understand what he wants to play the drums.  He want to play the drums. I look, I made it clear my intentions.  I might have Jamie want to play the drums. He would just get a drum set and bring it here. So really it's on you.  Jamie, I sorry. I was trying to get things going on. I'm sorry about your own here in Australia, you know, so this is.  Yeah, this is it. So James Miller Jr, who served as a US undersecretary of defense for policy from 2012 to 2014, recall that he swore an oath of office to support and defend the Constitution, United States and to bear true faith and allegiance to the same similar what the defense secretary had done before he took office on Monday, June 1st. Twenty twenty.  I believe you violated that oath, Miller wrote to Espera Miller's reasoning centered on President Donald Trump's visit Monday to St. John's Church in Washington, DC, where police cleared peaceful protesters with tear gas so he could pose with a Bible for photographs that that defines twenty twenty that this was an idea that was not only just thrown up the flagpole, but they're like, fuck, yeah, wait, I'm sorry, I can only tell right now, but what was that like?  Was there like a quote under the like was just Hymn of the Bible or did he just say not to say anything? That was this is what happened. I don't get it. There's a lot going on. One of the things that's going on is that they let this church on fire. OK, and another thing that's going on is that someone posted at the church on fire. And then CNN's Brian Stelter.  So they say his name was this is one of the fellows on CNN. This adorable fellow on CNN was tweeting that there's no fire, there's no evidence, there's no story that there's a fire. This is what I'm talking. And then the video comes out of the fire. And then he deletes all those tweets.  So it's Trump who is also it's also like a jab at CNN, like, see, fucking idiots, you are fake news.  Like you said, there's no fire. This place burnt down. And I'm going to go stand in front of it and I'm going to hold up a Bible. So that's what he's fighting about. There's a lot of ego shit going on with that. That's why I decided to stand in front of that church holding the Bible. It was also that he's trying to look he's in a dogfight right now when it comes to like his constituents, when it comes to the idea of a reelection, when it comes to the fact that everything keeps falling apart, he said, like the worst set of circumstances, whether he brought it on or not.  covid George Floyd, the fires, the riots, like he couldn't have predicted any of this, the looting. It's madness, right?  So, like, I had to get fucking something. He's got to love me.  Jesus, where where. Jesus, this is where. Right.  This is where we're out thinking shit. Yeah. You know of the law and order about it's like what you said about someone playing a musical instrument.  So you said that it looked like someone who doesn't want to play guitar slinging guitar pool is another example that like you see a guy in a movie that's supposed to know how to play pool and seem like can hold the pool, stick all stupid and how it goes.  Yeah, that's what makes people play the violin. What's it like with the pool? You look good. Oh, it's all right. It's all right.  We're playing pool earlier. So school that he put on the glove, for the record, he wore the whole glove.  Hold the book like a guy reads books. Yeah, that's is then you could open Lindsey. He's got like played cynical theory. But this is just doing so.  You hold the book, let him do the book. But if I'm holding the book like this, it was upside down.  Yeah. You ever done it? Give me someone. This is like this is definitely not read this book post book place. You have to buy it. I buy it.  But he loves that book or you love that book.  D'abord. Yeah. Look at him so stupid.  This is the Bible. You'll never be ever ever forgotten. It's written all over the world in many, many ways. This an amazing, amazing, amazing book. So special. So boring about the whole narcissism thing is it's terrifying. I'm terrified of that man. He scares the fuck out of me. I want to shave his head and give him mushrooms.  Do I want to do I dare you? I wish I could. You probably can. Wish you would listen to king of Spotify now. Yeah, I'm just a rules. Just a minor jester. I think I'm second to Bill Simmons over there. I think there's no worries. Just give him mushrooms.  Just one. One fucking really.  Is that your preferred psychedelic dose? It's a good one. You know, I'm my preferred one is probably marijuana. I think marijuana is a psychedelic.  I just think it's a I concur. It's a daily use psychedelic.  If you did mushrooms every day, but you can't talk to anybody and be useless.  I beg to differ. Microdots. Oh, yes. OK, well, I'm talking about Blitz, you know, big chest mushrooms.  Yeah. No, I don't have some though.  What are we doing later. Did I tell you guys about when I. So I was quarantined with my parents for a month. So when I first saw you Joe, when I was here last with Gary, like two days later I went on tour, tour, got cancelled. I was in New York, drove down to my parents house and then things are getting weird and got weirder and weirder. And then I was there for a month with my parents and I.  I messed up big time because I took acid one day when I was there.  And you made the right choice. No, I thought they were going to be gone.  And then I had a friend with me, my friend Jose was there, one of my buddies from childhood. And the whole thing, the acid.  No, I brought here and I, I was originally like, let's take a whole tab. And he's like, let's go half. And I, honest to God, move a powerful Hosai.  Well, we both we both we both cut it in half. We both took a tab and then like fifteen minutes later my mom walked in the door.  I'm thirty five years old and I was like, oh no. So I was like, oh no, no, no. It's just, it's just because they're on holiday and she's like, my mom calls me Louie, God bless our little animals.  But she's like, if she calls me Lumi Louie, what do you do with it?  I was like, Oh, I got to tell her.  And so I like but it should be noted, not the first time you've been on psychedelics, myself included.  Yeah, well, this is different.  She this this is I respect my parents so much and I don't want to get too personal, but one of my uncles OD'd on PCP when my mom was a kid.  So she has like, you know, she's got a thing. Mushroom's to her are fine because they're like from the Earth.  So she she got really, really mad at me, like you don't like because someone gave it to me, someone I trust.  But she was like, you know, like, well, she was terrified of me and I was too.  I saw her like, oh yeah. Because she got into that Manson. I mean, I was white as a sheet and I was I did not look good. And I it was hard core trippin like it wasn't a little bit I went deep.  But I was also so aware that my mom was like I went to check on her when I was like really tripping balls.  And she was she was curled up on her bed with the dogs. And she was looking at me. I was like and I looked at her. I was like, I'm going to go back to my room.  And then I had, like, the giggle part where I just couldn't stop laughing. But at one point I do want to share this and I'm like, no, it Jose.  I was trying to, like, get some sense of normalcy and I was trying to eat food and I put on planet Earth, which was very healing at that time, of of just just being in a total place.  And Jose needed to get sick and at that same time, not so powerful, just powerful at the same time. I was watching. I swear to God, I swear to God.  True story like Jose is in the bathroom, like and then there were grizzly bears going out. Is anybody watching this? That's me is the best moment ever.  So. Oh, God, you know who took the best grizzly bear footage ever that Timothy Treadwell got that crazy guy?  Was that the grizzly man? Yeah, yeah, yeah.  That guy took the best grizzly. He paid the price.  Well, he fucked up for sure, but along the way he got he love this.  I'm just going to be a real cynical take on this. But you got to understand, this is all coming from love.  That guy, even though he died getting killed by grizzlies in a hilarious, the best unintentionally hilarious documentary ever. Come on. Grizzly Man is so scared to watch that I don't rescue that shit. I can't watch the tape. I don't play it for you.  There's no tape, really. No, no, they don't. But there is a no, no, no, no, no. Werner Herzog got the tape and he destroyed it.  He did not want it to be out there for it to be murder porn for people. It was he said it was powerful song. And Werner Herzog, you know, I mean, he knows the fuck he's doing. He's made some of the most amazing documentaries of all time.  Right. But that I guarantee you, he made that thing funny on purpose. There's no way he didn't. The timing in it is so good. There's a sheriff, the sheriff at one point in time after the guy dies. The sheriff, first of all, looks like a sheriff in a fucking Quentin Tarantino movie. Right. He just looks like he's total. Total a sheriff. He looks right in the camera, goes, I thought he was retarded.  And he's talking about picking garbage bags.  This guy off of the fucking off of the shore and seeing the big bear feasting on his rib cage.  They show. They know, they talk about it. He talks about how he flew over in his plane and noticed the ribs poking out and saw the bear rummaging in his chest cavity.  It is a crazy document. The I thought that there's sound.  There's no sound, OK, there's a version of it online. But it's I thought that I think that's that's why I never watched it. You've got to trust me. I've seen it nine times.  Jesus, I'm not as that might be like 13 Texas Rangers we got and then we hit the Grizzly Man. There's time we're going to go back for Zululand. But really, here's the thing.  There's something in this about there's something in this movie about acceptance.  There's something about about tolerance. He was gay. Oh. And I'm ninety nine thousand percent positive that he's gay, but he was pretending he wasn't. So this guy's talking like this and he's walking through the woods going, I wish I had a girlfriend, but I don't, you know, like, OK, girl, girls just don't like me. I don't know why. Like, maybe because you live with monsters in a house made out, of course, like a Joe exotic parody.  No, no. Down here.  No, he's like he's like this guy that's like he's got a bandana on. It's like I'm out of here protecting these bears. These bears didn't even know he was alive. They didn't give a fuck about him. Not only that, like the wildlife management of Alaska is fantastic. Like they know exactly how they got there. They are well, they got it all covered.  You know, I just watched the Joe Exotic thing. And in regards to that, there's like this weird megalomania with like.  Convincing yourself that you have this control over these wild beasts, it's fucking crazy. It's very, very similar. Very similar. And I had these moments where it's really like really first of all, they're all a bunch of narcissists and they're crazy. But I felt really sad for Jo, exotic because it was like what would have happened if maybe he were truly accepted for who he was when he was a kid and loved by his father. Like, would he have gone to these extreme.  No, but I enjoyed that fucking amazing show. This is my whole point about Grizzly Man, even though that guy live entertainment, even though this guy lived this fucked up, tortured life, ultimately what was created was amazing and it was entertaining for millions of people. It gave millions of people a great feeling watching Grizzly Man and watching Joe Exotic.  We had about an hour down the line. Yes, all the time to Beethoven. That was that fucked up dude, but still listen to his shit. But but this guy's life was like an art project. This Timothy Treadwell's life was like an art project is literally holding a camcorder, walking through this bare corridor where these enormous grizzly bears are. And he's like, I wish I could find a girlfriend, but I can't. If I was gay would be easy.  This he says, I'll just go to a rest stop. And he said that. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But I'm not gay.  So it's like, okay, that guy needed mushrooms, but we wouldn't have gotten Grizzly Man. He just got a shit together.  Is this we need to do like extreme listen, psychedelic dispensing.  It sounds preposterous, but everything I say sounds preposterous. So it's OK. I'm a preposterous person. Sort of true.  But I believe I believe that if mushrooms were decriminalized and people were allowed to use them and in fact decriminalized is probably better. You know why? Because I don't think anybody should sell mushrooms because I think mushrooms are so sacred, you should never profit off of them.  I agree. I really do agree. I think decriminalizing is enough just so that no one can ever break. But you can't sell it. Just give it away to people or make sure if you're selling it, you should sell it for just enough to take care of the soil and feed it.  You should make your money some other way.  And I think that for you, for people, I mean, there's amazing business that could be have through selling mushrooms. I'm not opposed to it. Don't look, I'll flip flop on this back and forth. But I think if I was giving someone advice, if I said, could you make it without doing that, could you make without selling it? I would say, OK, don't sell it. Give it away.  Just give it away and make make deals with people. If they want to give you tomatoes that they grew, take that and give them mushrooms. It doesn't seem like something that should be tented, something that should be painted rather by I'm with you by the darkness of the human soul.  I feel like there's a there's a there's some there's power and money just like this power in power.  It's the same thing like having like wanting to sell more units. You don't need any mushrooms, Ben.  You don't want that energy. You never want anybody pushing on you. You want like you should do mushrooms because it's like calling you.  I don't think anybody should ever it just makes me think about music because everything makes me think about music usually. But when you're talking about this thing, well, how do we manage the sale of this? The presence is not in our society. We need it. We're going to do it anyway. Always a human behavior. Boom, there's a price tag. Oh, shit.  Things are getting weird and it's a constant ethical people that work with you. So you don't think about just just think about your art.  You know, I'm very inescapable because it's in the system. Right. And the system is going to react to it. Respond to what consumers are going to react in their way.  And if you can, I guess, keep yourself completely apart from consumer opinion, then you can. Is that what you're saying? Kind of like maintain a purity?  You don't think that's ever really possible? It's not possible. But I think you can you can have an ethic in your head, like you can have an operating strategy in your head that you're going to avoid as much of that as possible.  And just sort of like what does it take to be the best artist you could be?  The problem with that is sometimes it takes for you to be a fuckup. Oh, yeah. I don't know if I buy that.  Well, no, I mean, if I buy it either. I know we don't have to buy it. That's consumers. It's not for sale. Here's some of my favorite artists.  Like I give this an example so many times, but I have to use it. My great friend Joey Diaz, he's one of my favorite people.  That dude, I love him great. Every time I'm with him, every time I perform with him, I work with him. Every time I hang out with him, I always feel like I'm blessed, like I'm not joking.  That's a magical thing. It's he's been my friend for I'll tear up. He's been my friend for like twenty three years.  But like he you don't get a Joey Diaz without pain. It doesn't exist. You can't have a kid who lives in a gated community who has tutors to teach him how to play piano and who's on the soccer team. And you know, you can't you don't get a Joey is you know how Joey Diaz found his mother? He was on acid and she was dead and he was thirteen. He found her when he was on acid. I didn't know she was dead on the kitchen floor when he was thirteen.  Joey Diaz is gone through some shit. And on the other hand, he comes out this beautiful creation of the universe, you don't get diamonds unless you have pressure and pressure.  Yeah, but those those are uncontrollable. Yeah. Yeah. But the things that our control. Sorry, I'm just saying, like some artists, like I will never be as funny as Joy Diaz, it's literally not possible. I don't think anybody's funnier than him. I think he hits these moments that are funnier than I've seen comedy for.  I've been a professional comedian for like 32 years, never seen anybody funnier. I've seen them all. I've seen Kinnison live. I saw Bill Hicks live. I've seen Chris Rock. I've worked with Chappelle. I've seen Chappelle live 100 times. You know, I work with Pryor. You know, I had a chance to work with some.  Yes, well, it was that story late, late in his career when he was he's actually dying and he would go on stage that would carry him to the stage.  I went on after carrying him to the stage, carry him to the stage.  My friend Chewey, who is an amazing musician who used to be the doorman at the Comedy Store, he and this guy Dave would carry, who's Marilyn Martina's husband would was a hilarious comedian, would carry Richard Pryor to the chair, and they put him in the chair and they would crank up the volume like this because he's so far gone.  Oh, my God, that's what it was like. That was a photo of him.  Wow. That was exactly. So if you saw him, you saw me, because when he would go on stage, Mitzi would always put me on afterwards because Mitzi knew it was basically an impossible task.  It was an impossible task, first of all, for some 27 year old dipshit to go on after the greatest comedian of all time ever. Right. No matter what I did, it was I was failed.  But the fact that everybody got to see him when they knew he was rapidly deteriorating, it wasn't going to get better. And he just wanted to be out there with his fans. And people loved him so much.  And I would I would go on stage and it was like I was at a funeral trying to tell jokes, God so bad. But it was so bad. It felt so bad. First of all, it felt bad because the first time I ever really understood what comedy was, I saw live in the Sunset Strip in the movie theater. My parents took me when I was like 15. And we were in the audience.  And I remember looking around at all these people, like falling out of their chairs laughing. And I remember I was laughing so hard. It's like, how is this guy doing this? By just talking, right? How is he doing this?  So for me to like to to be able to work with that guy to to to do all these shows with that guy, no one's funnier than it is.  Yeah, no one. All these people I work with, the greats, I've seen them all. Joey Diaz hits these highs. Yeah. They like there's a new vibration. He pops through to some new level. Yeah. And he's not he might not be the best joke writer of all time. You know, he might not have the most clever thing to say that makes you go, wow. But he hits you with some fucking punch lines that are harder than anybody's ever.  He's the Earnie Shavers of punch lines. He just drops bombs on you.  You're like, what the fuck? You know, I think it was Ernie. Shavar, sorry.  Journey is a very famous heavyweight boxer in the 1970s that was known for his punching power.  Sorry. You know, it's like baseball. Have you asked? I did a Dennis Miller on you.  I brought up some. Yeah, you totally did. For but for fight fans, they would know exactly what I'm talking about. He's like the Francis Gano of stand up comics. That's a great way to put it on. It was very top of UFC contender. That's more contemporary also.  Yeah, yeah.  Francis in Ghana was the single Francis in Ghana is the single most powerful combat sport I've ever seen. Francis Francis.  Well, and wish I could put up a photo of Francis just so he gets an understanding what the fuck he's writing down.  Yeah, Francis is absolutely the scariest heavyweight to ever compete in the UFC.  He's I think he's six foot six, two hundred and sixty pounds. A freak athlete who grew up working in the sand mines.  He dug sand in Africa.  Come on, when is it not contemporary? Was he from was he from Cameroon? Oh, I spelled that wrong. See where he was from.  He's an amazing athlete. Like like terrified. Yeah. Cameroon.  Thirty three young athlete. And he's younger than us.  So, you know, I don't think you can sort of gauge what is age, but what does it say. What age is to say? He's 33. Oh, is that correct.  Sixty six for September 5th. That's five.  That's amazing because I thought he was older than that. That's crazy. Well you know, he's fucking terrifying.  The thing about this is like a little backtrack. You're talking about diyas and and suffering. People that have had really intense things in their lives that they've overcome and grown from are the most incredible people on the planet, 100 percent.  And, you know, and I have empathy for folks that aren't able to do that.  But the thing is, it's like when you have this capacity to grow from.  Horrible things, you have the capacity for wisdom and also comedy and also like trying to live a peaceful, beautiful life. And the thing is, like life is fucked up.  Like we can't we can't control what's coming at us, but you can control how you fucking deal with it and your accountability.  And I, I am with you on the front of people that inspire me on that level, that have been through things that I can't imagine but have come out in this like, beautiful way that they express themselves and with inspiration and comedy and music and acting or whatever artistic.  But, you know, not even art.  It's just our American music comes out of that. Yeah, that's what that comes out of. Yeah. You know, that comes out of a cultural experience.  You ever listen to the old Robert Johnson shit? Yeah. Fuck, yeah. That's crazy, right?  Incredible. You listen to that. You go, wait a minute. When was this like you have to put, I think music like like comedy and they share this. One thing is that you have to put the music or the comedy in the context of the time it was created. Like I'm a giant Lenny Bruce fan. You see, if you walk around this place, you see all these Lenny Bruce concert posters outside.  That's because he was such a pioneer, too, like he was the he was he's patient zero. He's patient zero. But if you listen to his stuff, today might not be that funny. Like, some of it's not that good in terms of, like, how far things have gone. Like if you watched Chappelle's latest special and then you try to watch Lenny Bruce would be hard to watch Lenny Bruce.  Yeah, but it's his timing and all that stuff is still in the context of it.  But for me, it's like go back and listen to Robert Johnson and then just think. Wait a minute, what year was this? Yeah. What year was this and what what what kind of music were people making? This dude was just like this very free, haunting sound that Robert Johnson had.  I wish we could play it.  Jeez, I hope when we go to Spotify, we can play some fucking cool right now. I'm saying just play some Robert Johnson give and give them the shackles. The great. Just let him have the cash. I just want to hear it. Yeah, I want to hear I just want to get pulled. Yeah.  That shit, it transcends time, you know, respect for my Jewish friends.  Thanks for the call. It's a great name for money. It is. It sounds good. That sounds fun. Give up. Chuckles Yeah. It's a sure thing. I'm all about the shekels, like I'm all about the Benjamins. That's OK. But let's say I'm a double duty. I get it.  I get it from the t shirt.  I wonder how much Ben Franklin really did because like, it's history. So interesting. I was thinking about this today. Like, we need people to write shit down that we have to trust that you're going to tell the truth and most people are full of shit.  So how does that work out?  What do you think? Paul Revere never ran around going. The British are coming. Do you know that? No, I did not know. I didn't know that either. I found out two years. Tell you the truth, I was reading this whole story about what really happened, that Paul Revere wasn't really riding down the street with a horse saying the British are coming, the British are coming.  No, another dude did it and he was shaking quite a bit.  Yeah, he was taking credit for it. Yeah. Yeah. It's the thing is, I said this earlier. I don't know what I don't know what's real or true anymore.  Know, even even when we have the age of cell phones and people take videos right now we have someone saying, hey, this is the tennis ball. Another person saying, oh, no, it's purple. And you're like, what? What could be? But like, there's no comparison.  There's black and white that are the the lower look like.  Laura, what the thing is, you know, back to Donald Trump, like, there's just. A complete lack of of information of of like is this like one person saying this thing, the other person saying this thing and I'm watching a video and you're telling me it's not true, but how is it not true? Because I'm watching.  Right. I'm so fucking confused.  He's creating his own reality and well, he's been one there's a lot of people doing that 100 percent. This is the he's playing a game, OK?  And the game has already been established. That game must be full of shit. If it supports your cause, the left does it as well as the right.  It's a human issue, but it's a partisan human issue, you know, and he's particularly Cydia. Do you know?  And I think he buys into I think that's a requisite, too, is that he has to believe his own bullshit got to be able to say when you fucked up.  But you can say that with power.  Why is that not a thing? Why can't they do that right now? The rock for president. Step in. I just saw your Instagram. Love my brother. Listen, you could do it. I vote for you. No one is going to fuck with you. You are America, by the way. Look at you look beautiful. Son of a bitch.  He's a man with a platform. But I am a better man. I work in two or three times, but he's so, so big. I remember that movie, this enormous.  Oh, my first band to L.A. I was like a P.A. on this movie, just like, you know, completely brainless.  And he was in the movie and he came in a movie with a man and he's a super nice guy, super sweet, legitimately super nice guy, incredibly ambitious. Like he's the American dream. Yeah. Came up from poverty comes yeah.  Epitomizes hard work and he's got a heart like he clearly is a nice guy and he's a real man. He's not some soy boy, he's not some single.  I'm not that informative. He should be the same. Should I drink soy. You should feel the pain. You should drink raw buffalo milk mixed with blood. No need. No need like a Comanche.  Relax, you got to get it right from the other to to all. You've got to get it out there. It's OK. So you'll be all right. Go easy on it. Actually I don't drink it anymore. I drink rice. Milk. We've got to get you out there eating raw ducks. Yeah. You need going to be fine. Don't let this get some liver in your diet.  I did masculinity. I don't remember. Right now, the president, the question of all the health impacts, do you ever see the rocks, cheap days?  No, it's the most special thing you've ever. What is it like he has it's a staggering amount of food. No, it's OK. Pancakes and waffles and cookies and brownies. I just want you to pick me up. Sorry. Pizza is like just pizza. This is. This is him. That's his meals.  This is like a set. You know, he's on the set. Oh yeah. No bullshit.  So he has one day when he goes to Wal-Mart as a machine, he's 14 feet tall.  He doesn't he makes 14 feet.  But I here's here's my thing. This guy is the real deal. Like, he's an exceptional human. He works really hard and he's really nice. And he stands for a lot of things that we can all appreciate. He stands for hard work. Yeah, he stands for respect. He's very complimentary of people. He's very friendly. Like he's a nice guy. He's a good person and he's enormous.  That's a fact. Yeah. He's American. He's a god damn good uncle on a machine gun.  Is is there is there like a major position of power right now, that person that also has the capacity to have empathy because that man clearly has empathy.  That man does that. Yeah. The rock to, you know, as a president. Yeah.  Listen, I don't think he would become a politician. I think we've done with politicians. Trump really showed that a nonpolitician businessman is the host of a reality show, can be the king of the world. OK, well, now that we know that kids like that, I like Mike and Mike for president. I would fucking vote for killer Mike.  Mike, he said he could be president. No bullshit about me. I worship that man.  I think he's brilliant. I love him.

It's incredible. Please check it out.  But he said, lost it. Lost it. Come back.  He referred to Donald Trump as owner of a casino like the casino operating owner is our president.

Before my father died, I had a baby with I don't know if it will be raised in captivity. It'll be raised privately to be the greatest politician that has ever lived. Oh, she's Meghan McCain. And I'm on a news show called The View. And Donald Trump, that fucking riverboat casino captain is shit about my father. My father was tortured for a hundred years. This fucking country came back and he started seven wars because he's a gentleman. Because I like you, Trump.  I'm going to wear my father's skin mask and I'm going to primary trump the right.

That's Tim Dillane.  Tim Dillane. Tim, looking good here with us tonight. Yeah, he's a gay fella. He gets away with more things. Is that a thing? Fuck, yeah. OK, he's right, Larry.  I'm right.

It's really a show, but it's with his standup style really, really good and really smart.  He's figured out a way to show he's got to get a show. No, no, no, no, no, no.  Fuck that. OK, tell me exactly what he's doing. All right. Just do exactly what he's doing for you to keep making those Internet things. Yeah, do it. All right. He's got he's got one YouTube show.

He's going to be on next week, too. What the fuck? I love him. He's a good friend. He's better. You love it. He does a thing on Central Park. Karen, that lady that freaked out and that was her dog to death. So I shared it with so many people. Let this wonder and wonder if you wonder why black people are freaking out.  This this is real. These are real people. First of all, the guy who was using the dog treats like, come on, man, like, I wish you were perfect. I wish you were perfect. And she was just crazy, you know.  Yeah. Keep going over the dog.  Like, keep dog trying to give her treats. Her dog treats. Dogs are not supposed to.  Yeah. Dogs are not supposed to be off leash. Right. Right, right. Yeah.  I see dogs go off leash. I believe he's a bird watcher. Yes. No in fact OK. Bird watchers are really hard core.  I got really into optics because I was like when I, when I started hunting, I really got into binoculars, OK? I was trying to figure out why some binoculars are really expensive and what they used them for.  And bird watching is a big deal. Yeah. Like the people that are like really into birds, like spotting birds. It's like there's some bird.  Are you Bernard Huge. Bernard, dude. Yeah. There's something that people there's an orgasmic quality when people find like owl cats hiding in a hole in their history. Yeah.  Yeah. There's a it's I don't know what it is.  It might be tied to like hunter gatherer DNA or some shit, but I just love birds.  But it's the same feeling that you get when you catch a fish.  I also love fishing Degauque.  I think, you know, that thing that you get. There's a rush. You might catch a fish. I think it's like Hunter-Gatherer shit. It's I got one. I got one. And you see a bird. Even if you just seen it with your your binoculars. Oh, there he is. There he's hiding.  Well, look, look, look, look, look, look, look. It's amazing. It's weird, right.  No it's not bad, but so that's why that dude is pissed off. These fucking dipshit dogs that are supposed to be on leashes are running around and she lost her dog in her job, so.  Well, that's fucked up. Is it, though? Did you watch the video? Yeah, she's fucked up. She's fucked up. I mean, for sure.  But she lose her dog the moment where she says, I'm going to tell in African-Americans threatening my life. And it was just so matter of fact and gross.  And in that moment, would you want that person working for you and with. You know, I would, but I don't I don't know her. Right. So I don't know if she's redeemable.  I don't know what that was about. I don't know if she had a panic attack because it was just her.  And that's you know, that's very generous. And I appreciate that that perspective. You you have to consider that a lot of people are very scared of conflict. And when women are in the presence of a man confronting them in an angry way about something, I don't care what race was.  He wasn't angry. But this man, a calm and gentle that's like, OK, he he was genuinely he was accusing her of not having a dog, I'm sure.  Yeah. And she didn't like being told what to do by a black person.  And that's true. I think that's certainly true.  I mean, I also think for sure 100 percent that was a conflict. And during conflicts, people act irrationally. They don't know what to do. Sure. They get out of their own head, they fuck up. It could be a clear example of just how she acts all the time, that she is always racist and she's always choise, exaggerates and admits having her.  She posted a video after the fact and said Andrew Shults talks about this. He she said, I I wasn't I'm not racist. I was afraid for my life, which is possible.  So this is the only reason why I would say racism because.  But not afraid for your life by a gentle person who was like, hey, can you put your dog on a leash? It could be it could be racism. It could also be racism on top of conflict. Like maybe racism would never show itself. But then in conflict, she panics. Some people panic during conflict. Sure. And when when you're looking at someone that's doing something awful in a crisis situation, like we've seen people hit people.  I watched this video the other day of this lady is coming up to this guy in the street. And the only reason I found this is because people kept saying, do this. You did.  You hit this lady in the head with a two by four foot because this fucking lady and so many other people yelling in Spanish, yelling in Spanish, and this lady has this big ass fucking stick and she walks up to this dude who looks exactly like me.  And he says he has a two by four and he says something in Spanish. She doesn't listen and he bonks her in the head with his two by four and knocks her unconscious.  That's why this is so I swear to God, like five of my friends sent me this.  So she gets mad at him and she goes and picks up a stick to yell at each other with.  You might get, you know, a little bit further towards the full version towards the fight. Yeah. So it was this. It looks like they're in front. Yeah. See, that's the guy in the white shirt and they're talking shit to each other, this guy and this girl, which is just so crazy. Right. Go a little further ahead. There it is right now. Oh, wow. She comes up. Oh, boy. It's pretty joyous, those pants.  He has no juice. Oh, he has sleeves on that. He looks exactly knocked out.  That might have been me. Holy shit. I might have taken Ambien and hit that lady over the head with a stick. She does not look conscious. She's not.  She's 100 percent unconscious. He hit her in the way. This is crazy.  I don't know what the context was, but she go back again. What are you talking about? Come back up. Back up so you can see what's happening. She walks up, she grabs a stick and he's like, stop, get the fuck away from me.  So she starts coming towards him and when she starts coming towards him, she's got this big ass fucking stick.  And I don't. Right in front of the United Express. Here goes. Look, she's coming at him full speed with this stick. And he's like, oh, no, Jesus Christ, stop, stop.  He swing that hard either he just kind of gave a a bump.  That's all it takes.  I mean, most people are not very two by four resilient. It's like taking a look at him.  Every time I get two by four, I just get right back up to in the head with a two by four with that one side.  So you're so heavy. I have to pee.  That was a situation of conflict. Yes. And you know, you can't put aside any racial. She certainly fucked up.  I'm not an apologist and she certainly lied, which is indicative of a character flaw. It's not not just that she tried to talk her way out of this. She tried to be reasonable. She wasn't being reasonable. Just look how she was treating her dog. Right. Oh, you treat your dog in a very horrible way, like basically holding it up, like choking the fucking thing once she immediately identifies him as African-American.  Love your dog. You don't want to ever hang them. You don't fucking pull the leash like, hey, get over here. Maybe she just doesn't know how to use the leash. You don't hold them up in the air.  Yeah, it is bizarre.  But I also think that's indicative of someone who's going through a panic attack. Sure. She just wants to control that dog. She literally doesn't give a fuck. You know, she's just shut the fuck up, you know, and she's 100 percent wrong. Don't get me wrong, I'm not excusing her. But I'm saying when you look at what it really is, it's a woman who is alone with a man and the man is catching her doing some shit she's not supposed to do and he's got a camera on her.  Right. So that's all those things freak people out.  A lot of factors. There's a lot of things going on there. It's not just this is who she is like. And the guy was like he had treats. But I get it from his perspective. If you live in an area and this area has been clearly assigned as a place where if you have a dog, that dog has to be on a leash, that's super reasonable, man.  Your dog leash. Take it around, enjoy the park with everybody else. But don't ruin it for everybody else because you want your dog to run free. You need to find another place to have a dog. Yeah, you can't have a dog here. And if this gets act together, there's all these birds there. So this dude is like really in a fucking spot in birds. I've never been into like bird watching, but I fucking 100 percent get it because I've seen some cool hunting.  I'm sure you feel the same way, right? Yeah. I mean, I think it's slightly different.  Right. I mean, there's you can enjoy the beauty of birds without wanting to go kill them. Sure.  You know, but. But isn't there an element when you're hunting, you find the moment where you come across this animal.  It's not just kill, it's it is beauty.  But you've got to put that aside and that get the job done. It's too it's too intense, but.  Right. It's and it's it's too fraught with. So you can fuck it up.  So you're confronting those I've never hunted before. So you real weird.  You're you pull up a file from like the back of your hard drive like, oh, I forgot about this folder. And you pull out this folder of like these Hunter-Gatherer instincts that pop in like the same thing. When you catch a fish, it's like catching a fish is something. Oh, I got him. I got him. I got him. I got the fish.  But there's something more terrifying about mammals like a mammal.  It's when you're fishing, it's so passive. Most of the time you're what? You're baiting something. You hook it.  Yeah, but you have to make a decision in a moment to act aggressively and to, you know, and this thing's like, yeah.  And you have to prepare for it to have to think about it all the time. It's not a simple thing.  You have to think about it all the time so you could choose to get your meat the regular way or choose to do it that way. And I've chosen to do it that way because it adds this.  I still mostly domestic cows and stuff like that, but it adds this element of what food is like when I eat something. Then I killed myself. It's there's a weird element to that.  It's a well, I like a truthful isn't the right word, but it's it's a more clear representation of the process.  It's honest. Yeah. Yeah. That's a better word. Understand what it is.  But you also understand, like I've come across, you know, ones that have been killed by wolves.  We came across I mean, my friend Mike, we're we're in my car between Canada in B.C. and we came across this moose calf that had been destroyed by wolves and torn apart.  It was so strange, man. It was like.  Part of me was because it was real fresh, like within a few days, like maybe a day might have been that day and when they walked away from it, because it was like hair everywhere and the stripped down bones and it was just a spot in the middle of the woods.  We just came across a moose calf. Yeah.  And you realize, like, wow, this is how they usually go.  Yeah. The violence is a different type of violence. This is how they usually die.  They just get torn apart out here in this field, which is the thing that freaked me out that I didn't expect. Jimmy, I know I have this on my Instagram.  See if you can find it. Good luck. Because it's like 2013.  I think I was on this moose hunt in B.C. with my friend Ben O'Brien. And we were when we were going through these woods looking for a moose, we found this moose calf that had been killed by wolves.  And it was you could tell it was 100 percent.  Mike knew Mike right away. He just knows. I mean, he lives there. He's a professional guide and a rancher. That's it right there.  So this is what freaked me out is all the hair like I didn't expect the hair. Is that dog here? Is that. No, no, no, no, no. It's moose hair. That's the hair from the animal that they killed. Why is it gray? And it must be. Well, they have like a lot of white moose has a lot of white on their underbelly in particular. They have a lot of white. They all vary.  That was 290 weeks ago. Oh, wow. Is that nuts? You want to measure time in that way? That's kind of scary.  Yeah. Two hundred ninety weeks. So that was a photo that I took. I think it was about three hours north of Vancouver. We landed in Vancouver and drove up there up north is amazing though.  There's something about that when you're around these animals that are just killing other animals and just eating a mountain and you just we found it because he saw some birds like, you know, the way people live up there.  If you live around wolves and bears and you just you're in tune with all this shit. So, yeah, I didn't even notice it. He saw some birds that were kind of circling around this one area. I was like, let's go see what the fuck they're interested in. Yeah.  And then we got there and stumbled upon that.  When you when you're in nature and you start to integrate yourself and become in tune, it's fucking fascinating.  I, I've never hunted, but I fish a lot. And when you're fly fishing, you start to become aware of the bugs that are around you and what kind of flies that you want to make for your bait.  And it's it's really interesting.  It feels very spiritual. I think that what people are when they're in cities are like people, what their are when when they're having sex with two condoms on two condoms.  Nobody, nobody. OK, you're just no sense to it. Would you go to the woods when you go to the woods?  It's like you you feel the wind different because it's like the wind just moving through the trees. It's not blocked off by buildings and coming down these streets and alleys, it's different wind.  It's wind like in a natural trajectory, you know, it's very different city birds and rural birds. Yeah, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Yeah. I mean, those are the smartest by the way. They're smart as fuck. Smart pros, but just present.  And when you're out there and there's no sound. And there's there's no media, there's no nothing, and you just hearing the whistling of the wind and you hear a stream and you hear a hawk and you see an animal walk through the brush and you don't know what it is.  And then you realize, like, what if I wasn't here?  This would be exactly how this would go down. This has nothing. How lucky are you to. Yeah. Yeah. And this and it's right.  We're muted. Yeah. We're muted by our artificially constructed civilization where we've narrowed down the possibilities of being eaten. Yeah.  That's when it comes that everything else is super vulnerable to. Yeah.  All the time we've narrowed that down. We use our big brains and our fucking opposable thumbs and we said, look, I've got to stop being eaten by cats. Shit. Let's make some fucking glasses. We need some guns. We need to be vigilant.  What's interesting, I mean, I think I'd rather live in a city than get eaten. Yes. Oh, dude, 100 percent. Well, that's maybe that's selfish, but I think you selfish. I think there's a balance to be had and I don't think we should create that balance. I think we need to spend more time in that world to understand what the world is. I think we're basing our our view of the world off of blunt data.  I don't think it's giving us a real nuanced sense of what your your part in the universe is. I think a big part of that is the light pollution that we're all afflicted by. Sure, there's something really humbling about staring out into the space and seeing all the stars. Yeah.  And we have decided that lights are more important than the Enlightenment that you get from staring at space. And I don't know if it's a good call, not a good call.  Some of the best not good moments of my life have been hanging out with people I care about, looking up at the star at the stars. It's so powerful. There's something about it. We're just it's a it's a reality check. OK, man, this is forever. Yeah. Above your head. It doesn't have an ending to it.  You can't even you're thinking about the small, insular little world that you live in. Maybe you're a part of something that's literally infinite and you're flying through it right now. Yeah. And you've decided that it's more important to be able to drive at ten o'clock down a nice, well lit street than it is to see the majesty of the universe when your inability to understand that plays into so many of the things we talking about earlier.  Yeah, yeah.  Cops freaking out, people freaking out, all unable to recognize, you know, a more total awareness in a situation.  If you want to boil it down to the natural brass tacks of like, you know, Mother Earth, if you want to look at it that way, saying go go to your fucking room and we have to sit and let her let her breathe.  I mean, think about what's happened in the past few months is just in terms of pollution in the way that the earth is growing and all kinds of incredible things are happening, like with the monkeys.  And it was it India that they were, you know, the course of Thailand. You see the Thailand. When was that? Thailand. There was where there was no tourists anymore.  So we're going to war with each other. Yeah, but I mean that just thousands run the it's not as beautiful as I wanted to pick this thought.  So it's like that's my cousin know.  Right. But you're right. Mother Nature's telling us to go to. Right. And I think I think we would like to believe that our systems, all of them are they're independent. Right. That our system of the way we view each other, if you if you wanted to look at like racism, classism, sexism, all the different isms and all the different biases, the things have people leaning left and leaning right and censoring people that oppose them.  You wanted to look at it like a system, like the thoughts are a system. And then then all the life forms are system.  There's a there's some sort of a moving flowing give and take to all of it to life and death and or the organic structure of the the land that you live on. It's all supposed to work together. Animals die, they fertilize the ground. And as soon as we we we jam ourselves into this when we go, you know what, fuck fertilizer. How about we grow these fucking things with chemicals and we put them in a big warehouse and we force Mexicans to work here for three dollars an hour across the border?  There really is. And then people get sent and then the abuse and then all these negative things and then they affect crime. And then crime affects the way you think about each other.  And it wants to take accountability for choices like the guys upstairs, like the ones in power don't want to say, well, this is what we did. But since it's all fucked up and it's not working, we're going to just point our fingers at these people.  Well, because, like, fuck up, we hate them and we want them out of office. You fucking loser. You ruin this economy. You know, they don't even have a chance to fuck up. Yeah, but people fuck up everything they do.  But so much of the tension of it is that consciousness comes from that natural system and is part of it. Yeah. So how do you reconciling that?  Is, is that the chimpanzee or the bonobo. That's where the.  Rooms come in yellow, the mushrooms show you the grand pattern and make you realize how you fucked it up, kid, one of the saddest things I've discovered as a fisherwoman, I don't get I don't get to finish as much as I would like.  Angler. Yeah, anger. Think it's a better job.  Not every place that I've gone fishing in the past few years and beautiful places, even in pristine nature, we were we were fly fishing in Montana on the Clark Fork River.  And it's like not a piece of trash for miles, like just eagles, ospreys, just absolutely stunning.  People getting eaten, people getting left and right. Come couple.  But but you can't eat any of the fish that you catch because some time in the 70s or 80s, the mines that they were using in the area started leaking minerals into the river and it contaminated the area. And you can't you'll get really sick and like, not true.  Yes, it is just a rumor. No, no, no, no, no. We're hearing this is this there's some areas where that that's the case, like out of the areas around Billings. There's a lot of places that have had it. But if you're in like other places, like, I guarantee you you could eat the fish Shark Fork River in Montana, I don't believe.  But here's what I'm saying is there's it would be an ecological catastrophe of the highest order of the United States has ever seen.  If all the rivers in Montana were polluted to the point where you couldn't eat the fish, you're talking about a certain section.  Maybe there's a certain section. I don't know what imagine it has to be that would be horrific.  But even then, like when we were one of our last river trips a couple of years ago, we went we did our Ben and I were hired as entertainment for this incredible trip on the Snake River in Hell's Canyon in Oregon.  And I mean, no cell service for three days. So, you know, I was fucking cell phone.  You're like shitting outside like like doing a hole on the grass or, you know, you know, we like we had like a bucket situation, rose.  And then you put this like that is horrifying. But I would run, but you got to do it both. Hey, hey. Toughen up.  Rogen Yeah. That's where I draw the line. That's right. Yeah.  But yeah, I'm not saying I'm not Christian, but, you know, when I went hunting with Brian Cowen, we didn't know we had to shit in the forest and I took his shit. I have a picture somewhere, my phone. I put a flag in aluminum foil and I planted it in his shit and I had him standing over it with his pants down to his ankles. Give me the thumbs up. And we're in the middle of Montana.  We tell you some Cal and I, we we we hunted for seven days. It was one long, ridiculous joke after another.  Oh, all we were doing this stuff like that. Jesus Christ. Brian Cowen came up with he.  Yeah, sure. He came up with a character called the Ravine Comer is a guy who finds ravines, just jacks often. And, you know, it was just I like some came out, some people like a bunch of opinions. Some people are into hair and eyes. I like a fucking ravine. You know, I was like, I come over. I don't know. CAGAR guys, we're dying. You're filming this hunting show and you got Brian Coulon is miming jacking off into a movie.  And this is kind of like it is shit. We were crying. It was so ridiculous.  Oh my God.  I had a real I wish you were there. I wish you could see it. It was one of the things you see next time. Well, fake jerk off.  And then I think whatever we got to do, I think they even filmed it, but they wouldn't put it on the show. And I was like, you know, I mean, you would lose a lot of fans, but you gain a lot, too. Yeah. Yeah, I'm used to it these days.  It's like an ebb and flow. Oh, my God, no.  But there's something there's something to be said about my this is clague pork fish kill mine waste.  Yeah.  So there's some of them that's got to be like one creek because I think one of the things they do a pretty big river though course it's got a lot of rain.  The fish kills that have happened in the past a lot of times here, shortly after big rain events, rain starts to run over land.  It'll pick up a lot of metals from those contaminated areas we call Siskins or Silicon's Siskins is better, isn't silicon's better, silicon's all those metals and get into the river.  Very slick and slick. Have you ever heard that word?  Oh, silicon's or pieces of ground in the upper class fork watershed devoid of life due to heavy metal contamination dating back to the early twentieth century flood that washed mine waste off the Butte Hill and down river all the way to Missoula. Yeah. So all the way down there, those fish could die.  But that's what's so disconcerting is, you know, since the 80s or 90s, back to when Ben and I did this river raft trip, which was so it was just beautiful.  But I mean, you're in the middle of nowhere. No cell service, like nothing but nature.  And when we were on the Snake River in Hell's Canyon, it's a canyon, right? It's so like any runoff from farms up top is going to end up in the river.  And we did a lot of fishing and every almost everything I caught any catfish that came up bass all had like weird abscesses on them.  And like but like you could see, you could see. Why did we go there?  What that I wonder why. I mean, maybe next time let's go to different river.  Oh great. Great idea then. Cool. Just a river. Let's let's go there. Another place in there. Just because we have abscesses on your fish.  Because if not like.  Well we want to fish there. Yeah maybe. Yeah.  That's the darker. The darkest. That's a great idea actually. That's a dark horse deal with mining. Right. That's the thing that everyone's terrified of. I have a lot of good friends that are involved in conservation and a lot of the laws that get passed in terms of like what affects wildlife, like what areas are allowed to be open for mining and stuff like that.  They're always like moving and trying to stop stuff like that from being happened from from being drilled from.  Yeah, because you never know. I mean, there's there's so many times it's it'll poison the system. And if that's the case and it goes all the way down to Missoula, I don't know how far that is from Clark for.  Because what it is because the river is called Clark Fork. And how far away is it from Missoula? Probably like an hour or so. Not known. Not for it's not far. But imagine that if it goes all the way down there.  So that's like what the thing is, 60 miles, there's this great fucked up creek.  There's this great book called The Four Fish, and it came out a long time ago, which is makes it scarier. But this the writer talks I can't remember his name talks about like the four remaining fish.  And then there's all the, like, farming industries and how that's kind of like just kind of cross-bred and our river systems.  And so at this point, like, if someone's like this is your Atlantic salmon, it's not necessarily the Atlantic salmon. That would have been the same salmon. Oh, yeah, it's farmland. Everything.  It's like nothing is what it used to be, the way it's evolved.  And the sad part is and I am such an optimist at heart, but like in terms of fishing and like getting and you could probably relate to this with hunting, like authentic clean fish, like it's not a thing.  We've fucked with the Earth too much with our pesticides in the way that we farm, in the way that we try to fuck with nature. Like it's just not you have to you don't know what you're catching. And if you're going to ingest it, like who knows what it is anymore.  There's a there's a great book that actually just got released about salmon. It's my friend Steve Rinella on the Meat Eater, interviewed the author and yeah, he's great. Steve's an amazing guy and he's just one of the best representatives for a like a like the best well, read arguments for a hunting fishing lifestyle. But he has this great podcast called Meat Eater. And he had on this guy who wrote this book on salmon. He was explaining how complicated it is for salmon to bounce back, because if you took some farmed salmon and just threw them in a river with a bunch of salmon that are swimming up river to breed like these dumb salmon wouldn't know where to go.  They're fucking there in a farm. They just sit around waiting to be fed. Yeah, they don't know anything. So they're here. They are, you know. Twenty four pounds, just dumb as fuck. Just like a robot person. Like they don't like where we go for food.  I bet you got to earn this food. You kill these fish bugs. Just jump off the wrong side of the river. You guys are swimming up river. What the fuck is wrong with you? Why don't you just wait for the film?  The guy. What about the guy? And apparently there's supposed to be pellets, right?  They tell me there's going to be pellets here. Yeah. Where's the fucking pellets page?  Apparently each river, like each tributary is specific to one sort of like almost breed of salmon. Yeah. Like the type of salmon. And they don't even know how the fuck they know how to come back to the place where they were born. So they find the place they're born and they they fucking die.  They're shit. How do they go back there.  They know it. And if you block the river they don't know what the fuck to do. So when people put dams up and shit and they both of them just kill off giant strains like this majestic animal. But it's so it's such a weird animal because it's got to travel to the ocean. It's just weird.  It gets smaller and smaller every year, the population. And that's what it's like at this point. Like, are we just going to start eating farmed salmon? And only from like what's hot is that thing.  It's got other consequences, too, with orcas. There's a resident population, I think, in the Puget Sound around Seattle and the Pacific Northwest. There's a resident population of these dolphins that only eat salmon.  I think they're only dicks. I think they only know there's no salmon for them anymore. They're fucking starving the shit. I feel bad they won't eat the other stuff. The ones that are thriving, the salmon that are.  Driving up there are the ones that are transitory, they and they come in and they eat the seals and shit, they eat mammals and these are the ones who won't eat seals. They just won't eat them. They only want to eat salmon. Since there's no salmon.  They're like literally they're worried they're going to die. They just don't have they don't have it. They don't have it. Yeah. You ever read that book Sapiens? Yes.  It's amazing. Oh, my God. Was it Noah Duvall? Harare. Yeah, Harare.  Yeah, right. He's got those amazing, incredible book. It's so eye opening.  And he talks about, um, this is dating back what, seventy eighty ninety thousand years whenever the human species are Homo sapiens were introduced into an environment somewhere between like 50 and 80 percent of the other species in 100 years were extinct.  Yeah. It's just a natural, you know, side effect of sharing space with humans.  Wow. I never thought of it that. Well, we do shit. Well, it's I think it's also because we figured out how to make these houses and get away from being eaten. We've gotten like super ridiculous about the way we allocate resources. And we made way too many of us.  You know, we're like rats on a sinking ship. There's so many of us at this point.  I kind of feel like holding on to my nostalgic, like fishing, you know, experiences and things like that.  I just have to keep going forward and be like, all right, this is the new norm. You know, you can't do this, can't do that.  I think there's a there's something else going on with fish. There's a thing that's one example, though.  It is. But just everything. But I should just say that in the culture of fly fishing, it's more common and respected to catch and release than, I would say any other type of fishing. Yeah. And the first fish.  Yeah, well, I like I like eating when I catch something weird and I've gone catch and release fishing before. I have done it before. It is fun but there's something about catching and then eating it that day that's extremely satisfying.  And then also it's like I know it's legal to catch and release, I know it's legal, but should it be I mean, what do you do and you play a little game.  I could have killed you, but I'm you know, you playing like is paying like you're playing unwilling jujitsu with, like, some dudes in a parking lot. He just grab it. I'm just gonna kill you and not like, let's go take care buddy. Like, no decided to fuck with that fish's day, don't you know, they start to learn. They're like, I'm not falling for that shit again. They're not that smart.  We're assuming that that's smart. I think if you make something that looks like a fly, they just jump on it.  You know, there's I can't believe it is a mask.  Do you make do you jump on flight? I'm just you know, I bowed to my instincts. Fly fishing is bad ass. Don't get me wrong. There's like it's an art form. It's really interesting. Like, I've watched, like, really good fly fisherman. There's something about it with a strip in that line there. Jet plop in that cast. There's something about it.  It's very hunt. Oh Johnny Stick Fish are men stream and the thing. Well I like fly fishing a lot.  I do prefer it's been real fishing. Is it just preference.  But is it like ballet. It's like the ballet for the river.  Yeah. Like hibachi grills. Everybody has a different favorite kind of fishing. My favorite kind of fishing was always bass fishing. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Is there just such an American animal face is way too big. It's got a giant mouth. You mean a large.  Yeah. Large or small. Well face to face it's way too big. SMALLMOUTH bass still is a big fucking mouth.  You know, it's, it's just it's relative. It's all relative. Yeah. But that's a you know, that's a that's an American kind of fishing.  You know, you throw in a like a crank bait on a lily pad, pulling it off the lilypad water. And you see this explosion of water. Yeah. Fucking they're getting closer. Yeah. Yeah. That's what I that's what I like about it. That's what I like about this being real. And also there's a little more variety personally. There's been real fishing.  You can, you know, fly fishing, you're on the bus, you're mostly catching trout, not like trout or great love trout.  It's for rich white guys.  Let's be honest. It's for a few weird lesbians and rich white guys.  Your words to this? Yeah, that's do it.  It it's like guys are looking for peace and quiet and doing shit their wife doesn't want to do. They're putting on rubber pants and they try to live with their wife. Oh my God.  Jeez. And quiet out of the office.  Serving bass fishing is like you listen to Johnny Cash songs. Drinking beer. Yeah. And casting shoes.  Let's play soft rubber worms. I'll play song. Do you want to play.  I don't know what you want to play. Can you play me one for me. Can I make a request. Can I request L.A. River. Oh no. OK, ok. I literally have to look up the lyrics.  Really. Oh that's your song. I know you don't understand. There's so many songs between. OK, how about Angel of Death though. Be super. Nostalgic. OK, this is the song I forgot to get my other fiddle fiddle from you guys to free whiskey.  Can I just have one? How good is young Jamie and so good basic lyrics. Both songs because he wants them. He's got L.A. River shoot up and ready to rock.  Yeah, this is this is such I mean, this is such.  Why are you guys don't get to share with each other on my show.  Just this is my space. I hate that word by the way. I hate that word for people to talk about in this space.  If I were you, I would be playing games. You playing games with words in this space. What space is this is this is just space around the human race and on earth space.  We're all in this space.  What show I'm obsessed with right now, space shuttle space for us. Are you really. Oh, so good. So good. OK, now I have to watch a terrible review of. Oh, it's hilarious.  I mean, I'm not super feeling OK. You just weigh in.  And I think you're right also because I couldn't, I couldn't I couldn't follow up with a big fan just saying, listen, train driver, can he have his own opinion?  Can our friend Ben have his own opinion? Just please? Why did you let me do let me just why are you going to be here in private? This is not about any critical issue. This shows how tribal people are. We're only talking about a television show, about my sense of identity. We're not, you know, aggressive about his views on a sitcom. Sit with us. Sit with it, with it.  I'm an my words anchor. I back the alcohol.  We're really accepting each of our differences.  You know, it really doesn't up Joe. So so, I mean, you wouldn't listen. I guess you're not like space for us.  You're not what you're allowed to not like. Well, of course I respect that. I feel like I can't even watch it now because I love both of you and I don't want to pick a side. No. See, you could feel how you feel, though, Joe.  I don't listen to Suzanne. No, I don't want to try to mess up.  I'm really sorry my where I'm going to listen, Suzanne, I'll do everything other than space focus. And that's all that's important to me, which is weird, but it's so good. You know, you go, what are your candles? Yeah, but I don't think it's lit it. Big Lebowski.  Big Lebowski. Big Lebowski. Yes or no.  Great film paperback. Well, you can be my friend. That's what it takes deep in.  This is like an hour and a half. Two hours. How we do it. It's four o'clock. And why are you keeping time? Because I'm bored.  I was like my first. Otherwise things get weird.  Angel of death you are. And your early revver. You don't have to play first.  Oh, no, I can't just.  OK, just how bad this could be. Elon Musk weed son. What do you mean when you say that he smoked it or he made it. He smoked when he figured out how to connect that SpaceX thing to the space station.  I know this is the stuff that killed the stock by six percent that we find it didn't really bounce back instantly.  It's is people panicking because he's a super genius. We should go with it.  Raised it because it's so much higher now than it was then. Way higher, yes. Well, I think every time he talks for in long form, his stock goes up.  He's just got to understand who he is, trust me, OK?  Don't trust me on everything, but trust me, leave that guy alone. I don't give him all the encouragement you can. He's he's doing crazy shit. Yeah. He's not trying to harm anybody. He's trying to build tunnels that shoot you all the way to Las Vegas. He's trying to make electric cars to go zero to 60 in one and a half seconds.  He's trying to put us on Mars like positive support. Keep helping you with him. Don't troll Elon Musk. Not anybody who does that. Like, please. I know you can. He's just about to quit Twitter again. You fuck. Yes. No, no, no. Right. Am I right?  Yeah. He's about to quit Twitter again. I mean, maybe that's OK. Maybe he and Joe.  Joe, they don't need someone who can say to you, OK, well, I don't know how much he's. Oh, shit, I wouldn't listen to me if I was him, if I was him, it is be like if my 10 year old came to me with some really good advice, I'd have to put that shit through a long filter.  10 year old. So you're talking with 10 year old 50.  Exactly. Got it. Same thing. Basically the same thing. If I come to him with an idea, he's gonna be like, oh, cool.  Yeah, call you back. So chill. He's like, I listen to the last podcast and he's just so he's a good guy.  I enjoy being in his presence. Yeah. He's a very nice person, despite being and there was a weird moment, like the first podcast we did where I asked him, I said I go, what is going on in your head?  I go, what is it? Like, what is it like being you?  Because I could tell you can tell when you're talking to him. Right. It's almost like you're talking to someone who had. If you imagine that the mind is like every other part of the body, we've all seen people that have ridiculous body parts, right? We've all seen people that were born with enormous breasts like.  Right. I know. But covering is it.  That's just a random pop. Some dudes are born with enormous noses, enormous feet, enormous dicks. It's just weird, random. You got to think the same thing happens. Sometimes the brain comes out just some supercharged one thousand horsepower hybrid engine and you're like, holy shit, let them drill, drill. Yeah, let them get us to Mars. Can't get to Mars, Marty. Let them let them get us to Mars. Yeah, that's what it's like.  That's how I feel with that guy. I'm like, just be nice to him, be nice to him and let him do whatever the fuck he wants.  Yeah. I listen to some of that podcast too, and it's interesting to see because he said something that stuck with me. You're talking about how his his decision to to sell all his houses.  Yeah.  And he says people see that as an attack vector. Yeah. I was like, dang yeah. That says a lot about his his narrative and his feel of the world.  He's the real deal. Folks, you got to listen to me. He'll go down in history. He's not a perfect person. No one is. He does flare up. He got mad at that guy who was criticizing him in that Thailand thing and he got sued for it. No one no one who's human is perfect. But he's trying to do amazing things for technology and for the environment, for the human race, for the propagation of the species.  He really thinks that we need to plan ahead and make colonies on Mars so that the human race can survive because he doesn't think it could totally survive on Earth. He's like there's a high likelihood that something can go wrong. And he's right. When you see what happened with the pandemic that was a minor, there was a dress rehearsal for a real event and we failed miserably. We panicked.  There was no talk of the immune system.  All the talk was like, oh, protect yourself, put a mask on, rubber gloves, sanitize. There was all this crazy talk.  And then at the end of that emerging, we're realizing like, this is not this is not correct. Like, they all had our probably our best interests in mind.  But human beings are human. They fuck up.  They're not right all the time. You know, we're all going to be OK to have that, though. When is it going to be OK to fuck up it? It just appears to not be OK.  You have to be willing to do it anyway. It doesn't matter for you to be honest. You have to be honest and you have to stay away from any sort of forum where someone can judge you in a dishonest way.  So if you're honest and someone is judging you on Twitter, if they're saying something, you and type on Twitter, something mean and nasty like we were talking about earlier before, about people who are bullies and people are bullies, like send you things.  And like when someone does something like that, it's a it's a function of the limitations of the system that you're working in, your work.  You're working in this weird thing where you're agreeing to type things. You're not even saying them.  You're you're just writing it out, putting a period there. It could be I don't even know what the the sound your voice was making. You broken things down to some real weird things. Right. And also, there's no accountability for what you're saying. You can't say in front of me like you told me, you take me to the moon. What the fuck are you talking about? Yeah, there's no you know, I'm saying so any kind of conflict that anybody gets online, like part of the problem is it's a shitty way to interact with people.  It just it's a super limited. It is.  It doesn't make any sense to me personally.  I recently this weekend opened up my Instagram to talk to people.  And I talked to like maybe like a hundred people over the weekend, just like the voice message and video message.  And every conversation I had, whether I was met with adverse opinions, was peaceful and like because we got to hear each other's voices.  And I don't want to fight with anybody. Like there was a rule of like if you're going to be nasty, I'm not going to respond to you. But if you want to talk to me about your opinions and the progress that I felt like I was, I made for myself just in trying to understand things that I could never understand because of who I am and where I come from.  It was it was so valuable.  But that per what you just said, like, I got to hear people's voices and look into their eyes and talk to them strangers, complete strangers. And it felt like something to do that wasn't just reposting things.  And that's that's, you know, has its purpose as well.  But I got to actually talk to people that that had something to say. And it was it was great.  And all the trolls that like the comment without having any like you're not going to fucking get anywhere. I didn't hear from those people and I really wanted to.  That's a good forum, though. You're actually talking. You're talking. They're talking. That's a good forum.  Even if you're doing that, just like a FaceTime thing either. Right, I. All this afterwards, I felt old, I was inspired, I didn't like if you're going to hate on me, sorry. See you later. But if you have if you want to try and meet in the middle, that's where something is going to get done.  And like, you know, I posted a couple of things and I people are so angry. And what did you got, people?  I posted a few things. I posted All Lives Matter.  No, I posted about Dick, as you know.  Could you but could you imagine if I ran up to you in like nineteen ninety five and I said, listen, one day, one day.  One day. If you write all lives matter, people will kick your ass.  Yeah, that is hilarious. That is fucking nuts. I keep thinking about that. Peter told me when I was a kid that like in twenty twenty we're going to run. I'd be like that would be me mad.  Just imagine that phrase. Imagine of a fucking Orwellian reality where that phrase get your ass kicked you like what what what what what what what real freedoms.  Where our our language is changing, you know, like yes.  It's that we have to be careful because the same way cops have power, people who want to control your language have power. It's all power. We shouldn't have magic words.  Words should convey intent. And as soon as you have some words that have an extra abracadabra to them, they get abused. Any kind of magic word, any forbidden word. I'm against forbidden words. I'm not against the sentiment that's attached to good or bad words.  I want you to be able to accurately express yourself so I can't play games with what you're saying. You say you say something to me and it seems valid, but and then you say the word pussy or some of the other will now discredit everything you said because you said a magic word that you can't use in my accepted version of speech.  That's what I'm worried about. I'm worried it's a sneaky backdoor for people to control conversations and pretend they understand what your intent is. Language is supposed to just be noises. We just have just have so much patience. And that brings me back to Elon Musk.  He was one of the things that he said was that you're going to be able to talk without using words. He's just crazy that he's going to drill holes in people's heads and shoot wires.  And then I like talking. I'm just love talking. It's like the acoustic guitar and talking is like the acoustic guitar of of communication.  No need what we do that stuff all the time anyway. We need acoustic guitars. My point. Oh my God. You heard it here. People, you thought they were gone. The bass.  All right. You know, some people really enjoy traditional archery. They want to shoot a bow. Totally do an Robinho.  Yeah, I've never and dress up like you never shot a bow. No, but yes. You know why you should.  Because you look like you could be Geena Davis daughter fucking comes back around. I know. I love her. When I was in Tell Man, I remember auditioning for a part for her daughter and I didn't get it. I was good.  I was good enough. Those one hundred percent. You could be Jan Davis, his daughter and Geena Davis is a serious archer. What?  Yes, like a really, really good girl.  Like amazing. Like like there's videos of her online. She got obsessed with archery. She was learning it for I believe it was a film role. And so she got really obsessed with pirate shit.  Remember that pirate won. OK, moving on movie. So that's all right. I told you about Zoolander. It wasn't Zoolander I just saw. It was another movie. I only have so much room. Forget I said no, but I loved her in the fly off.  Like Jeff Goldblum, Fly is one of the greatest horror movies of all time. Yeah, well, people talk about horror movies. There she is.  She's rich. I'm telling you. One to the forty one landed in the U.S. Olympic trials just before the 2000 games in Sydney. She said she did it on a whim, became obsessed with it. Sixty year old actress in a league of their own is one of my students.  She's amazing. Hey, Thelma and Louise, step the fuck off.  Watch. OK, how about that video?  That video? Geena Davis doing archery, but you got to see how she does it.  Like sometimes like someone who's a bad ass at one thing, we'll get really interested in something else. And it's interesting that he who that brought Geena Davis is a fucking serious archer like you watch her.  Yeah, it is. Look at this form. That is very soon, dude. Herzig, look at this.  She's shooting a fucking rape. She's dressed in the peaches uniform. Suck my dick.  That's all we got there. And it's back. Not only that, but it's a rubber dude, relentless.  But she's also she's also doing traditional archery. And what I mean by that is she doesn't have. She's got a gun. She's got to go to the fucking bears, but she she uses a recurve. So it's not a compound, but a compound bow like what a lot of hunters use is that psychodelic is gonna blow.  That's a modern version of an old school bow. It's a real way. You see it again.  She's releasing it. Oh, she's going. Gallagher hilarious. And shout out to Geena Davis. Yeah. She got into archery and she found out that a lot of people put a lot of people found out ever since.  I mean, the beginning of time there's something really weird. It's a really satisfying about releasing an arrow and watching it land on a target.  It doesn't have to be you could be a total vegan and enjoy archery. Archery is a sport for everyone, just like yoga. There's something to it.  So go spear like like fishing. When you catch a fish, you know how you catch a fish. It taps into some sort of ancient DNA is the same thing with archery. There's something about it that when you watch that action, there's a sure. But I think it has to do with the fact that throughout human history for like thousands of years, that was the best way to kill your dinner. You had to have a bow and arrow. And so they figured out guns.  So that shit is still in our city. I think it's a tension release thing. I think that's a natural human. We're tracking that in everything and so much of our communication.  Back to music, boom. I think it's so much of communication in music is just tension and release.  I think that as well. But I think there's many factors at play. But I think one of the factors is the DNA for sure. One of the factors is that, too, I think there's a lot of factors.  There's also the complexity, like the game, the puzzle factor, like one of the things that people like about catching a fish is the same thing they like about beating someone. It sorry.  It's like you, you know, I'm saying you won the game when I come off it are totally that's what it is. A lot of strategy involved. Yeah. There's a skill set.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. All right, all right.  It's all, it's all taps into our human reward system that is designed to reward us for the behavior that makes us more likely to survive, particularly when we're living in a place where we get eaten, which is most of the human history they eat.  And I think the eaten days are a big part of our DNA. I think that's a yeah. Yeah. Our response. Yeah, yeah.  You know, there was a there's a guy named Rupert Sheldrake that was talking about this, and one of the things he was saying is that yields.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Morphic resonance connected with Jake Bugg in his tour manager was obsessed with Rupert Sheldrake and he's talking about this.  Sorry, I was just going to say that one of the things that he said that's really fascinating said that there's things have a memory to them and that he believes that maybe even like objects have memory to them.  And one of the things that he was talking about is children, children who live in New York City. They're not afraid of child molesters or. Right. Or car accidents. They're afraid of monsters.  They're all afraid of monsters because we used to find monsters, cats, big cats. That's what everybody was afraid of.  The thing on dark that gets you because that's what kept killing people all throughout history. That's where all the werewolf movies come from, that the wolves are so smart.  They must be part human. They're really smart. Wolves are really smart. And they ate people forever till we figured out how to make houses.  They just ate us. Yeah. And all those things are they are dogs, but all these things are programmed into us. And you don't realize that until you're out actually in the woods and all those things are turned on again.  It's like Kit Gone System three, four and five, three, four, five. Their lives in the Bronx Coyotes near Griffith Park near Griffith Park.  And I saw one maybe 100 yards away.  And it couldn't give a fuck. No, it made it went wrong.  And the hairs on the back of my neck, it was a feeling I had felt before.  I've never seen a wolf. Did you thirst for blood?  I offered my blood as a sign of compassion. That's weird.  I've never seen a wolf in the wild that I'm absolutely sure of. I saw one I was with my friend campaigns in Alberta and we saw one walking across this dirt road. We're pretty sure it was a wolf. It was pretty big. It was like dog sized.  Yeah. You know, which is like when when you get anywhere around dog size, like 70, 80 pounds, you know, you're not dealing with a coyote anymore, probably especially in the woods. And there's a lot of wolves up there.  But that's if there's any animal that I would love to like, if I could just fucking follow them around with a drone and just watch them live their lives without me having any idea, was there to watch a wolf for a week, you know?  Yeah. That would give you a sense of what we have, this fucking weird Pixar ideology that comes to like wildlife.  I think even if you watch a documentary like what?  How close were you?  Where are these animals are our instincts have been muted, like we are in a digital age of self obsession, narcissism, and like people don't like kids don't play outside anymore.  They don't, like, go like the the population, you know, the population for like, you know, ranch life or getting to to integrate with nature and your own instincts is very small, very, you know, and back to New York, you know, talking about people not feeling getting fear and getting hit by a car, you know, all that stuff like it's a product of environment in our environments are so they're so digital.  And I think about my childhood a lot and how, like, you know, we just went and played outside. I grew up in outside Cleveland in the suburbs. And, you know, there'd be like a bunch of kids and, you know, you get hurt, you get stitches, you get cut or whatever.  But we were creative. Like, I never wore shoes for, like, months at a time in the summer.  You can that corner. And then I did fuck you. I never got I never got head lice or hookworms. So thank you very much.  You know, that makes me feel dumb. No. Does it do. Oh, shit. I hate to do this again.  I just talked about it like don't scare me because I got cats and I was so different. That's toxoplasmosis. No, but hookworms. This is a real thing. And I'm sorry for anybody who's heard this before, but I have to bring it up again. Hookworms are responsible for the stereotype of the dumb Southerner.  Really? No, real. They didn't fucking wash their hands. No, no, no. I had nothing to do that was now walking barefoot. Yeah, yeah. Walking barefoot. People were infected by hookworms. And hookworms are a parasite that affects brain function.  It drains people their energy and pull this out.  We're ready for life, hook it, freak you out. It thrives regions of extreme poverty. Poor sanitation affects some seven hundred forty million people worldwide.  A lot of people hookworm, just Google, hookworm, hookworm, dumb southern stereotype.  Google that real quick. Oh, here it is.  How a worm gave the South a bad name. So this is this is really all about. Yeah, yeah.  I'm and if you've heard this before, you're going to fucking know the story. Bro, I love you. You got to listen. There's a lot of people listen to this podcast haven't heard this. And this is like really important shit. There's reasons for some stereotypes.  And when you like, who will Trump's going to get us through this and you're doing a dumb Southern accent.  You must be on the hook worm. This is why you're doing a dumb Southern accent, because there's a Texan. There's a prejudice that when my toes itch. Oh, no, but listen, this happened. It was up to 40 percent of the population stretching from like Texas to scroll down a little bit.  The corporate taxes to west population stretching from southern Texas to West Virginia, hookworms stymie development throughout the region and bred stereotypes about lazy, moronic southerners. While the South eventually rid itself of hookworms, those parasites cost the region decades of development and bred widespread misconception about the people who lived there. Yet hookworm has not been defeated for good. Today, hundreds of millions of people in dozens of nations around the world suffer from hookworm infection. The South, experienced, measured in both successes and pitfalls, can provide a rough blueprint of how to seek out and quash this American murderer no matter where it's found around the world.  Imagine that. Imagine that. That literally, like every time I hear things like this, I'm like I have hookworm, like the little part.  Let's pause this.  And can we please just imagine, you know, all the stereotypes we have about the South, why would it be dumb to live in a place where it doesn't snow? Like, why are they done right?  That's fair. I mean, it's totally psyched points. Are those fucking people in Minneapolis and Illinois? They're fine, but there's something warm, right? It's fucking stupid about people that live here. It never snows. You assholes can't even get out of your driveway to shovel that bitch, driving them this bullshit ass slippery road. And you want to say this dude who lives in a place with alligators is dumb.  Come on. Are you sure? A lot of other factors, though, to jump.  This might be what are they doing? But hookworms in the south, as far as we know, to get into but take out all that deconstructions. Slavery. Yeah, but but I wanted to hear.  But listen, but this is one of the things that I really I think they might be connected to is that many people down there had it. I think it's really likely that it affected their ability to decide what's right and wrong, where the rest of the world had moved on. There's a real argument for that.  I mean, I think what might and I think that's absolutely worth exploring. Yeah, but there's, you know, cultures around the world who have had slavery that weren't connected but still do.  Or maybe still do. Yeah, for sure.  So there's just something in humans where they're able to adapt to the situation says hookworms aren't endemic to America's having likely arrived in the US in the 17th century, unwittingly imported with the Atlantic slave trade. What the hell? So the early 20th century, however, most in the U.S. did not know what a hookworm was.  You get it. That I'll bet millions of those parasites inhabited the guts of people throughout the South who do not wear shoes.  Hookworm symptoms were written off as simply being indicative of Southerners backward character.  That's great. That's crazy because like, you really have to stop and think about it.  Like all this, people in the South are dumb. Why? They're people. People are smart. Fuck people figure out how to put satellites in space, lets you get better VCR or whatever.  It's better if they are retired and they're living in the sky. My God, they're living in the sky for a year. You fuck.  Some people are dumb as shit, but some people aren't. Why? Well, a big part of it might be these fucking parasites. We might have a fucked up view of human beings totally. We might be behind the curve.  In my mind, it's like, no, I'm just like question.  How do you how do you get hookworm just walking around? You can get it from a lot of your skin. It goes through your skin. It's transdermal.  Yeah, it's transdermal. Yeah. Yeah.  There's a little of what you said. Poor sanitation, stuff like that. Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Poor sanitation. Look throughout history here goes to contracting by direct contact with feces as unseemly as in the south.  Unsurprisingly wanted no association with such a disease.  Oh my gosh. So they just kind of know it says they're not on board in the beginning. Yeah. The idea of hookworms, parasites that live within the body and are contracted by direct contact with feces. So they try because they're proud, they're proud people. Look, there's a thing that I listen to. I think it was on, um, I forget the podcast.  It might have been NPR, but there were radio lab where they were talking about the South. And one of the reasons why the South is what it is, is they have this sort of honor tradition.  And it's like a different way of looking at it based on like the people that initially the Scotch Irish.  Yeah. Based on the people that initially arrived in that area. And there's so many factors. And again, you could take this out of context and say I'm some sort of an apologist for racists. I'm not.  But I think you you absolutely have to think that all those people down there, whether it's the people that were the slaves, the people that are slave owners, all those people most likely had a lot. There was a giant percentage, those people that had that hookworm and who knows how much that affected just the whole region, the culture.  There's always going to be a problem when someone can force someone to work for free. Right. And that's what slavery is, right? Forcing someone to work for free. You controlling them, you're owning them. It's always going to be a problem with that. People always have a problem. If they can get away with shit, they can get away with shit, they'll fucking do it. But if they can get away with shit and also they're dumb and also the like, the their brains are depleted by a parasite, impaired by this thing.  So the rest of the world is saying, hey man, maybe we shouldn't have slaves anymore like them, but like. Right. I'm a fat man. But you know, they got a fucking 69 charger and a Confederate flag belt. Watch, watch the Chargers go down the road and so destroys childhood. Oh, listen, I'm a giant Mopar fan. Everybody knows that that's a dope car. But that's the Dukes of Hazzard car with the Confederate flag on the roof.  Yeah. Is 68 or 69. Charger thing was a sixty nine. And but that Confederate flag, do you know that that show they can't have on TV anymore, Dukes of Hazzard gets on TV anymore because that flag, the flag is offensive. It is.  It is offensive.  I wish it wasn't.  I wish we got to a point where there was no racism, where you can have a Confederate flag and people who use a fork put it on.  I guess it's going to work out that no, it might not ever, but maybe a thousand years from now, that's just how we go back. And we read the Sumerian text a thousand years from now. They'll be so woak they just watch a decent episode. Yeah, they go, oh, the first Daisy Dukes is this is the original Daisy Duke. Yeah. Or the people thousand years ago from now we're like swastikas are cool. Yeah.  It's a bit like Hitler or any shit you got. See that went wrong. No.  Have you seen the meme of a child is a child with his hands over his head leaning down like kids in the future, trying to remember for history class what happened in twenty twenty.  Oh no, that's hilarious. Fuck no. Oh my God. Why? You posted something other day and I started following the account. It was like little devil.  Is that right? Lil Duval is the best fallowed during the Pando funny.  And my point where there is there's a woman like going like this and it's like what what area of revelations am I looking at now or something like that?  Which chapter of revelations are we doing today? Yeah, well, my mom said this to me the other day because, you know, they're also alive right now.  My mom was like in her beautiful Cleveland accent. She's like, you know what?  If a bunch of weird bugs start flying out of the sky, I won't be surprised. It's like me too, Mom. I'm not going to be surprised either. Getting weirder every fucking day.  Are you optimistic? Yeah. You think we can pull through?  I think we can, because I think just the nature, the fact that so many people are protesting, I think we're dismantling things that haven't worked for a long time.  And I don't know what the answers are, but like we're bulldozing this shit.  Yeah.  And I, I am I'm hopeful that as a collective people, we will work towards cohesion. I hope she's at peace. We've got a lot of white guilt, we've got to work through these videos of these people that are on their knees bowing. Have you seen this in church? Yeah, they're basically like apologizing to this group of black people about all all racism.  It's hard. It's so hard. Like I told Ben this the other day, and then he kind of laughed at me. And then I realized that I was sorry.  I don't. What do you think?  Well, like, I went for a walk in my neighborhood and like and this was on Saturday. This was this was when things are superheated. They still are. But it was like kind of like, oh, my God. Like the grove is on fire. Most of my favorite restaurants was gone.  It's charred, you know, and and it's on it's gone.  You know, they fucking burn. Oh, no. That's one of my favorite restaurants, too.  Well, too bad to hear you make fun of that, but I don't mean to make the whiskey talk. It is my bed. I'm so sorry.  I know it's back around and they'll come back and actually pass that whiskey down.  And I just said no, but I was walking around the Silver Lake Reservoir and I told Ben I had this like, you know, every black person I passed. I just like I felt more love for them than I.  I have. I mean, I always feel love for everybody.  That's the truth. I mean, awareness. I just I just felt. So where you say I'm like, yeah, they're their road is different than mine right now. And I also want them to know, like, hey, I'm standing up for you. But also not every black person wants that.  Right. Right. Like, get the fuck away from me. Like, don't bother and be like, you know. And so in terms of white guilt, like, I don't have white guilt, but I have white awareness and I feel aware and I'm trying to step carefully and not hurt anybody's feelings because I don't want to listen.  You are in no way, shape or form a racist. And I think the problem is the the idea that you are to prove you not I think you're a beautiful person.  You're a great person. Just keep doing you.  And if you see me and you guys make eye contact and they know what the fuck is going on in the world, you know, what the fuck is going on the world to say, what's up? And they say, what's up? And everybody feels good. You know, like that's a that's a real thing with people like this. A weird thing when you run into people and you don't know what's up, and they go, hey, what's up?  And everybody's good. It's good for everybody. Yeah, that's what we all need to do. We all need to do that, guys, not us. That cop that did that. That's not us. That's a sick person. That's a sick person. Yeah. It's one of the reasons why we're so angry about that man killing George Floyd is because we know in the darkest of darkest regions of all of our minds, that is humanly possible for someone to do.  We know that and we hope and pray. It's not possible for us to do or anyone we know or anyone we love. Could you imagine if that was your son? You imagine if your son was on television leaning on this man's neck for eight minutes and 40 seconds, you'd be like, what the fuck?  What would you be like? What did I do wrong? What did I do wrong? Then I made a monster. Fuck you.  Imagine watching that. Imagine just freaking out while you put someone who thought of it that way. I leaned on someone's neck until they died. Every person. And this is one of the weird parts of being.  But also what if they they propagated that mentality? Like what if that were the thing, like not to throw this into the arena, but things I've been reading are like, you know, white supremacy infiltration into the police force.  And that fucking terrifies me. Look, any any white supremacy is awful. Any racism is awful.  But what I'm more interested than any of that is like what gets a person to beat that fucked up, whether it's racist or murderous or or or ruthless or deceptive or stealing, what gets a person?  That's what we need to concentrate on instead of getting mad at the people that fuck up and do terrible shit, which is all justified. But we really need to trace this back publicly. Like what is making a cop kill someone by leaning on his neck for eight and a half minutes or almost not the mental health issue.  I mean, it is. Yeah, it is.  It's like it's also a developmental issue. A person when you're thirty five years old, you're kind of an equation. There's a lot of you that is just accumulated gathering of experiences and your interpretation of those experiences, along with your genetics, your neighborhood, your family, all the expectations people have on you. And then boom, here you are. It's a it's an equation.  Yeah, it is. Hmm. I mean, back to the whole. Ah.  And that a huge part. I mean we're all talking about us saying it, but obviously a huge part of that equation is the system we grew up in, which happens to be fucking. Racist in a lot of ways, or at least has had trouble dealing with that issue from the very beginning. Here's what I would say. It's not even, you know, when when when you have these neighborhoods that are traditionally in there, they're suppressed.  Like when you're talking about Baltimore. I had this guy, Michael Wood, on the podcast. He was a cop in Baltimore.  I was one of the weirdest moments of the podcast ever where he was a cop and like the early 2000s, if I remember correctly, or somewhere in two thousands.  And he found this piece of paper that was a docket of all the crimes from like, you know, the 1970s and was all the same shit in the same areas.  So here he is risking his life out there with a gun, wading into crime, trying to arrest people. And then he finds this piece of paper. This is a this is systemic racism. Yeah. And then he finds out about the red line like you do the right thing.  Spike Lee movie. Oh, yeah. Yeah, for sure. Same exact thing. Yeah, exactly. Chokes the guy out and kills him. And in those 30 years, I mean, obviously this is going on hundreds of years.  But the point is, look, I know I know a lot of cops and a lot of them are great people, but they're a lot like soldiers.  It's not a normal request to ask people to be life or death every day. And when you ask people to be life or death every day for for a job, you better make sure that you get like a Navy SEAL. You better make sure you get an Army Ranger.  You better make sure you get someone who has gone through. He don't want them. Got to read the horrible shit.  They kill babies, bro. They were ruthless choice. Yeah. These are just babies. I mean, over the fire.  Difficult situation in front of their parent. Difficult context for those people. Good thing if they caught you, they tortured you. They were the kings of torture.  I'd like a quick death. Yeah. You don't know me personally.  I'm telling you. Empire of the Summer Moon.  It's an incredible work. Just get the audio book, listen to the first week of it, and you'll be like, holy fuck.  Yeah. Just like, you know, take it with you.  Like when you drive to the store, whatever the fuck you do, because I just go to the store. Have you been going. Oh, you've been hiding.  I've been doing stuff. I've been building furniture.  Are you starting to move back into society. Yeah. Yeah. I when my friends feel less of an issue I OK.  Am I'm cognizant of the coronavirus, the only people I know that have gotten it are in New York.  I.e., I work out, I walk, I go to the grocery store, I go to my friend's house and I build furniture, building furniture, the buildings, the furniture.  Wow. Yeah.  Are you building it like do you have a design.  Yeah. Yeah I have a walnut shelf I'm building that goes under my carpenter.  No I didn't know to do this. You figure it out something really hard. I mean my friends have the tools so I'm really lucky to use them. Like I don't own that stuff. But yeah, I mean, it's not that hard and it's really gratifying to to make your own stuff. And that's something I've really gotten into just to, you know, keep myself entertained. It's yeah.  Well that's a good thing. That's a good way. Using your energy, you write your energy comes a fork in the road. We're also of touring. Stop.  Oh, that can't go well, Joe. It haunts me when I was on here with Gary because we were literally talking about what does the world look like without live music?  And I'm like, bullshit that you can never replace live music. And here we are.  And I've been doing these live shows. I started doing like Zoome Sessions on my website is like, you know, Supplemental Income and also just to like have that experience with people, because any live stream I do is just you literally fucking looking at yourself and then comments underneath.  And I don't get to have this experience where I'm sitting across from someone even digitally, where, you know, it's it's like I nailed it.  I didn't know it totally didn't feel like it.  Capurso Obvious to everyone watching it. I didn't care what a blunt or do you want to see this is dead grass. Yeah. This is what is it. That's my dad.  That's some bullshit designed by the man to make you sleepy. Hey, it doesn't make it makes you a superstar, you know?  I mean, it's like a blend, so I don't get good company completely.  So don't hurt me. Just don't talk about this. Oh my.  Oh my God. There's a joint off. There's a Jamie there's a joint up here. You smoke a little bit of this. I'll talk a little bit. Everybody puts green spots. Green boys are fair. I haven't smoked anything, but I will do that.  I'm already so drunk. Look, we all have an obligation to show that smoking pot and drinking whiskey is not for bad people. We're all good people. We're nice to each other. We love each other.  We get together. We really do love you guys. It's so much fun. I love you. I'm so happy.  When you texted me, first of all, when I saw on Instagram sorry that you guys were together.  Speed. Oh, yeah. I literally said, oh shit. And I immediately texted you.  We were like, oh, let's just take this slow walk. You go easy with departing and soon Jojo, OK?  It goes like this. Ben and I came by this honestly. We love each other. We love our music together.  We're great friends. Two months ago, we're not speaking.  We weren't speaking for everyone. And then we we we started playing together. And it's like it's too good. It's too good. The feeling that we have when we play together. And we were going to do what we failed this week because bring it on right now.  I'll do it. Count me in this back.  Backtrack for a second. We you know, we're going to do a little podcast this week with each other and just like post a couple of songs. And it was like a big deal for us. And it still is. We're going to do it.  But obviously this week fucking blew up and it wasn't really like lined up.  But ten or fifteen minutes after we posted on our honey honey page that we were going to post some podcast songs, you texted and we're like, oh my God, oh, God.  It was just like being like hyperspeed.  I got bummed out when you guys stopped working together. We were to man, you know, but we we needed to do it.  It's okay. Listen, life takes weird turns. It's like a river goes down the mountains. Got to take you take the right path. Yeah.  Well some of us know I'm my as well. Thanks a lot Ben.  Nah, it's magic bubble gum.  That's a big one. I love that poster in the bathroom skittered and then it says The Stones. It says the greatest rock and roll band on Earth. Isn't that amazing? You know, they that that was what you called them. Yeah. Back then that was about well, that's for good reason, man.  The Stones are interesting in that there's a lot of Stones songs that people forgot. There's not a lot.  There's some bands. It's one of microdots. Yeah. There's some bands that that's not a micro.  Don't do it do you. And we got to make this legal. Ladies and gentlemen, we're going to make this look. This is what we're seeing, which is. Birchwood come from a birch tree got yeah, just shut it down if it don't put it right.  OK, I'm not saying that back. I mean do these I love pads and dump it.  We got to protect people, protect people from assholes and we got to let people do the shit they enjoy doing the show.  We love you so much. I love you guys too. This is so nice. All things considered, the world's in a crazy place.  And this is one of the best feelings I've had in a very long time.  Well, I always enjoy you guys. I enjoy seeing you. I enjoy listening to your music when you're not around. And listen, you guys, all the time I listen.  You guys want to work out.  Uh, I do think. Listen, guys, thank you.  Went on trips. You guys are cool as fuck. Thank you. It's hey. We listen to you too. Truth. Yeah.  Music is an interesting thing. You know, you guys, you put words together that changed the state of people's consciousness. You put tones together and you have rhythms and sounds and invades people's minds and it changes who they are.  And some songs are like really indicative of the times.  Like someone I think it was Snoop Dogg had Marvin Gaye. There was a live version of The Power of the Purse.  What's that song? Drogon sings. That's what's going on.  Yeah. Marvin Gaye. And you listen to me like, wow. Like, I don't know what it was like back then. I was too young. I don't remember, but I hope it's better now.  I feel like it is. I feel like there's something about these marches. You've got to take the looting out of the picture because I think if you want to follow the ideology of determinism that, you know, however you got there is a combination of a bunch of things that are probably out of your control and who you are and where you from and who your dad was and who your mom was. Here you are paying.  There's something about when you hear a song from 19 like 71 or some shit like that and you realize we're still dealing with the same shit, 20, 20, that really makes you worry that we're not going to get it right.  I think you're going to go that way with it. No, no, really, no bullshit. Like, I think there's beauty in the fact that everybody's gotten together and the rising up against it and then they realize like, this is this is enough.  It's enough. It's enough.  It's so enough. It's so enough. But you got to worry, you got to worry that shit will go sideways when you see the looting. Got this is like there's a lot of it is that there's like this weird battle going on, battle between like logic and anger among, you know, people raise. Well, people raise poorly. People are mad and people are happy.  And everyone's together in a big soup of equilibrium trying to find your way to the fucking to the steady ground, trying to figure it all out.  Most people just don't. And we're in and we're involved in that as much as we're involved in any other aspect of this. And we're all just trying to figure out life.  But all these things are information and, yeah, of course, how could we know we had no idea what's going to happen, but it's all information to apply to the situation. People are looting, OK?  This among a range of factions. There's economic problems and we got to fucking.  Yeah, it's a perfect storm. Well, I think the thing is, like, we have to try to find each other's perspectives, and that's really hard for some people to do.  And in one of the really wonderful people I spoke to this weekend really gave me an insight that I never would have had. And this gentleman lives in Texas.  And he had something to say about I posted a good cop video. I posted a video of a cop praying with a black woman.  And it was really beautiful. And the video and I got a lot of crap for it.  I got a lot of heat.  And I'm trying to find the middle ground of some of my also police force friends that actually one of our really good friends texted today to talk about how horrified he was that his city had gassed people.  And he's a lieutenant colonel of a very big city, retired now. And he said he was depressed. You know what to do. And I got to I got to think about him because he's a good man.  And in that respect, this gentleman who who reached out to me very kindly and I'm so grateful for it, said, here's why I don't like you posting that video of that happy cop scenario. He said, Because I grew up in poverty. I slept in the bed with my dad till I was ten because we didn't have another bed.  There were holes in our walls. We didn't have food. We he said cops weren't playing basketball with me in my neighborhood. If anything, I would see them beat up my friends and I couldn't do anything about it. He said, I'm angry and I don't want to see I don't want to see that right now. And I really respect that. That was a perspective I didn't have. And he also said, hey, I've done things in my life that I wasn't proud of.  All I could think of in my life was getting out of this place that I lived in. And I would you know, he he, you know, admitted to stealing things, theft to get his life in a place that he needed to get out of.  And he's out. And it was it was a a prospective faluting that I never would have had.  You know, looting is mania at this point. Like, I'm not sure like so many things.  It's just a fucking vomitus of like either people trying to cause trouble, anarky people just trying to be heard outlook on it, which is a guy framing it, saying these are people who can't take part in consumer economy.  So this is you know, it's a great framing.  Yeah. And that that should be recognized. I don't think that's the answer. But like I see you and that's the thing. It's like these people want to be seen.  They want to be hugged. Yeah. I don't want to fucking hug. Everybody wants to be loved. You know, Robert Sapolsky is. You ever heard of him?  He's a professor at Stanford and he has he's done some really interesting work on primates and baboons and and that Toxoplasma shit. There was talk we were talking about before. But one of the things that he was talking about, I had a podcast with him a couple of years back and he was saying that he's a really interesting guy.  And he was saying that in the future, he thinks that one of the the biggest mistakes that they'll look back on with us is that we didn't understand how a human being comes to be the person they are today and how many factors of their control.  And we try to pretend that everybody is and I'm paraphrasing greatly, but it was basically that human beings are responsible for their own actions and that collectively we all influence each other's actions.  We are we're all different people around each other. We're different people. It's one of the things that's the most important thing about having really, really good friends, like really good, important, awesome friends that literally make you better just being around them. They make you feel better. They make they make you love better.  You become a nicer person if you have exceptional friends. Yeah.  And that's what we're all weirdly connected like weirdly. And we don't understand it. So when something like this happens, there is like let's march and scream like yes, let's march.  Like we feel good, then we're all out there together. We feel good that we all agree we feel good. And then there's some people that disagree and there's some people that say stupid shit.  There's some people that get canceled like that. Yeah, yeah. We're all trying to right the ship.  We're all like just and stay in the boat like hold it on the boat of civilization. We are, we're going to be OK. We love each other. We're going to do so. We don't have to worry. Maybe there's plenty of food, but we didn't do any toilet paper.  We just got to do is go to Mars. We got to get the game with him.  We got to get the game right. Right. We can't, like some people can't start the game if you play them in. Properly and a dude starts out with a billion dollars, that's fucked up, man. You got a billion dollars. It was horrible. I just played Monopoly on mushrooms like a month ago before I had to do two separate areas. And my one friend was dominating the whole game and I was getting more and more bitter and angry.  And she fucking hotels that bitch and she killed us.  Conceptualizer I love how the game works. No, I like that player. But the irony of it is like, oh God. OK, noted. Got it. Because I'm like like every time she's like Alpe I that I was like, be that fucking bitch.  Why she don't need that. It's just kind of game. It's a great game. But is it, is it.  But is it deep down some property and one day.  One day. That's the weirdest thing about all of us. We just thrust into this game. We realized we were playing it. While we're up and running, we're up and running, learning how to walk. So what's going on?  You're saying, oh, what kind of game?  So when the rat race, it's the rat race. The guy the gentleman who I swear to God, I'm having deja vu. I feel like I talked about this last time I was here. But the guy who wrote Rich Dad, Poor Dad created a game called like it's like the rat race and it's how you economically get out of your debt and your spiraling investments or whatever. And then you get to the big leagues.  I mean, that's America, you know, like that's the that's America that we like best.  But it's not exactly the eagle. And the Eagles are fucking vulture.  The rock. Wow. Real life, the rock. Twenty, twenty four is going to take care of all that. Yeah.  I don't know what happened with your bullshit. I'm going to be gross. We're going to be pretty close. I'd definitely pick you.  I just want to be healthy, can pick you up and probably not even know he picked you up. Right. I don't want to be weird about this person. I may like tall girl and like, you know, it's like I just want to be me.  All bullshit aside, I take inspiration for clothes on your friend.  We all get it wrong. We all got to say, oh, I take my inspiration from that guy's like legitimately.  I'm joking around earlier about what I said, but I'm also true. I'm being honest.  I believe what I'm saying. No, I think he's a he's an unusual he's unusual.  I shouldn't objectify him as a big, strong man. A really good person can sexist.  I'm an asshole. And this space just unacceptable.  You've hetero normative, Tim. I think we're going with it. And that's not a fucking new word. That's really almost normative is that I know it's an important part of gender theory. Piece of shit I'm with. Yeah, right. You know, the thing that rhymes, you fucking asshole. All right, partner, I'll write an apology. I'm sorry.  Part of the problem, I am part of a white tiger going to be white violence.  We're going to be OK.  I don't know. I hope so. We're going to be OK. We all want everybody to be OK. We want we just got to get over this man as a as a species, the human species.  But we've got to get over all our ripples. Yeah. Yeah. The sensitivities, though, that that thing is like you're this you're that you're like the superlative talk is going to fucking get us nowhere.  And I saw a t shirt that I loved and it was in a photograph and it said, not left, not right but forward.  And like this whole bipartisan stuff, like you can't if you can just take a minute and listen to each other with an open heart 100 percent.  It's it's so hard for people, but it's really not, you know why we are not that hard. The no one's taught them how to do it. That's why it's not hard. That's hard to learn. There it is.  We mimic and everything else and everything. I like if you don't want to learn how to play guitar, you learn from people who knew how to play the guitar. If you want want to learn how to do archery like Gina Davis, you learn from people who know how to do archery.  We don't apply that to how you view the world.  Well, people can't accept these teachers are usually our parents and not everybody initially has has a great hand when it comes to them. They don't know. You said earlier just makes me think about us. We had a terrible time communicating with you. Talked.  Yeah. You know, that wasn't easy to go to therapy for twelve years and who knows, we were over. We could fucking go down after this.  Please don't do this. Let's keep going. Keep it going because or down. But but the point is.  No that's not mine. That's yours. I don't want that to be bad but it just made me think what you're saying.  It is not easy, you know, and it's something that we it's taken a long time and experience for us to be able to, even if you set me up to like our relationship has.  Up me up, too, like face adversity in the world, because we have fought so much, but we love each other so much and at the end of the day, we just want to hear each other out. And that's the thing with people that are aggressive or disagreeing with your rhetoric, like they just want to be heard and so do you.  So, yeah, like with that said, it's it's a time that I try to have as much patience as you can possibly muster with healthy boundaries.  But, you know, I really have gotten a lot out of speaking to people on social media lately, literally speaking, not just comments.  And I'm learning and I'm growing and I'm grateful and I've fallen on my fucking face, people telling me things that I never would have thought of.  It's so humbling because, like, ultimately, I want to help what's happening.  I don't want to see another black person get murdered by a police officer in a video ever again and as well as all of the other things that everybody wants to talk about, like we're all coming up. And I think we all agree.  We don't disagree. Exactly. That's what's unique about this time. I think everybody's looking at this and going, yeah, like we there's obviously problems.  There's real problems we're seeing in the cops that are treating the people that are peacefully protesting like you can't do that.  No, they're wrong. It's here's what's crazy. They're letting people loot, but they're shooting tear gas. The people that are just standing there saying the system's fucked.  Yeah, that's the information.  And there's so many details of of you know, we were speaking earlier about police officers and like their instability, like their their and their mental dysfunctional aspects.  And like, yeah, that needs to be addressed. Yeah.  In like an acute manner.  Like, it's not like being there for them. We just expect them to be superhuman. Yeah, they're not. And that's our fault. If if you are in credit card debt, you're freaking out and you can get fucking therapy. But if you're a cop and you see people get shot in the face every day, like suck it up, pig, you could barely pay attention. We barely, barely pay attention to them. So when they go haywire, you know, those three guys that sat around while that guy kneeled on Addus neck, like, what do you charge those guys with?  You know, there's been a real blunder to say they were when they joined the force, like, were they kids?  When they join the force, it's like a fraternity.  It's it's a wonderful it's a hundred percent a thing that. When you're in it, you're there, you're surrounded by people who are there to protect you, if shit hits the fan, there's there's a brotherhood that's involved in the police force.  If I had to guess what's wrong with the police force, but what is right about like the Navy SEALs is that one of them?  You it's really difficult to get into.  Like, if you meet a person and that person is a Navy SEAL, that motherfucker can take some shit. He can he has a strong mind. He's figured out a way to navigate the maze of consciousness, to go further than most people are capable of doing.  But that's not everybody who's a cop. So there's a lot of people who are cops, who are just bitches, they're just bitches.  And they just got a job as a cop and they have to work with guys like the Rock.  That's how you learn from them, you know.  But you're so right. There's the validation in that badge. There's a validation. And if it's not actually a genuine part of your integrity, then that's a fucking scary place.  It's all of us. It's one of the hardest jobs the world's ever known. Yeah, it's a really, really hard job being a cop.  Big fan of Killer Mike's review board idea, like bringing back review boards where the community, like, never disagreed with anything killer Mike's ever said ever.  He should be President Obama's thing. He's so powerful. Yeah. It's like his the way he speaks. I did not want to be here and I don't want to do this. Well, you like God damn you, you know, so it's yes, he's he's that's who he is.  There's no filter. That's who he is. I really, really hope I get to meet him sometime. I'll introduce you. I will die next time those guys are here.  Like, I think we're supposed to do something. I love both those dudes. They're so important in this time. There's no bullshit. There's no bullshit. If you want killer Mike, it's right there. Killer Mike's right there. There's no filters. Yeah, positive, negative, good, bad son of a cop. It talks about, you know, the Second Amendment and the need for handguns. I got up, but I was also super progressive.  He and I both were like, let's get Bernie Sanders in this thing. Let's see what the fuck happens if you get someone who redistribute wealth.  We're finding out now there's trillions of dollars that we we just want to fix a fucking hell. All right. We're going to fucking bail out Starbucks. We found all this money to our guy, for fuck's sake.  Did you see that? We're making porn where people are teaching people to fix their, like, home appliances and stuff like that. He was like, I'm going to make a series of YouTube videos so people can learn how to be handy around their home killer. Mike, that is. And it's like but people don't pay attention to anything except porn.  So I'm going to make a bunch of porn. It's easier to fix, you say. So porn is like human, right?  What is human? Human is the weird, the contrast of what we want you to believe.  But what we really are porn's the best example of that. How many people are at work talking about porn? How about zero. Yeah, it might be.  Oh it might be like the same amount of people that they catch Corona and die but people talking about porn at work your sexually psychologically because there's no correlation between that and real life sex and like just like from the digital stimulation, it's like, that's like saying like wisky ruin your life.  Now you find your life stupid. You don't blame WISC for me. Me and Whisky have had a great relationship. We made it work. Yeah, we made it work. We had a good time. It's probably a lot of dudes out there that understand the abracadabra of porn and they want to stay on the outside edges of the dangerous fear of control and they just hang in the background.  I mean, I, I think porn is like heroin. You should be able to do it, but you probably should.  And you're not going to be able to stop it together.  That should be your goal. You will never stop together.  It comes down to accountability, period. It's weird. It's weird how many people are fucking on video. If you really stop and think about it, it's like it's doing it right now.  It's barely even even unusual. Oh, it's barely unusual. The amount of sheer porn like I used to have a joke about it was like, why are they still making porn? Has anybody ever seen at all? Do they stop now? Let's catch up.  You got to say the. I wanted to I take it I miss the hottest scene ever because it's too much goddamn content. You gluttons just out there fucking every day filming it.  Never enough. It's like music though.  I mean, like across the street we're schooled right now, like all of those like quote unquote comforts or whatever, you know, we're going to funnel our energy into like all that shit is like fading out, like we're being restructured.  And yeah, I think the Matrix, we're learning how to be adults. We're we're learning what's important, like who who's who's far enough ahead on this weird race that you can stop and go, hey, hey, hey, hey, let's stop and work out the resources.  Yeah, we're what we're going to eat. We're running too far. This is not necessary. We're getting crazy. We only live to be 100. What are we doing? Let's be nice to each other. I shit. Why are we mad. Let's there's plenty of food. Yeah. It just needs to be distributed. There's plenty of money. We just need to figure out how to fix.  What do you think that is. The panic. And I like I really say this honestly like like no I don't want to like be like raped and murdered.  I don't want like my home to be right here. What is this like what does this need to, like, jump over each other to take all the toilet paper and like this we're in competition.  Right. But more so like I want to know, like but that's that's the whole thing.  The whole thing is for you to survive for resources.  Are we massive right now for attention, for money, for prominence, for you know, we've always done that.  Well, what you're talking about earlier with these fears that are kind of buried deep in our genetics, we're still dealing with, you know, software that's one hundred thousand years. I also think that is two things playing out at the same time, there's a sexual thing where where human beings are attracted to each other and you trying to figure out how to choose mates.  And then there's this look, whatever intrigues you thing, there's like you want people to like you. If you if you're gay, you want gay dudes like you. If you're straight, you want a straight woman to like you. And you also want to figure out this thing like me, this thing that you're doing, what's the thing you're doing?  You're playing tennis. What do you do, man? What do you do? You play tennis. What do you do? Your chess master?  What's your fucking expression? Yeah. What's your mode of expression?  And through your singing, particularly you. You're right here, my friend.  I know who you are because there's a there's a way you sing where you figure out a way to get it all out in these tones. And that's what makes singing so exciting for people who can't sing and for people who love to listen.  There's a thing where they getting it's like you're figuring you're figuring out a way to use a special lens to look right into a person and find out like, what is that person when they're at their lowest?  What is it when they're at their highest? And what is this when when they're really passionate about something? What is that expression?  It comes through in this weird melody, this weird, weird sound that you can make with your voice. But what you're doing is just showing people who you are, is showing people who you are through the sound that you can make.  And these words in this. And we use those sounds and those words as it's like translator to figure out what what you're really feeling and what you're really thinking.  And then when it's wrapped up in your lyrics, the thing that's fascinating about is how you guys are so tight and you love each other so much and like you're putting words together and you're singing these words and you're all putting it together in this music. Like L.A. River is one of my favorite songs ever. It really is one of the reasons why it's so it's so indicative about the beat. I thought I saw a body in the weeds like that's a part of a beautiful song.  I thought I saw a body in the weeds.  Do you want to talk about the fact that it was we had this great moment where this TV show used the song in this like romantic marriage. It was Mary. It was a wedding and it just showed you they don't like the fucking song is L.A.. It was a wedding singer. Yeah, I thought I saw a body in the weeds were like, OK, I do.  I do. I had to hop a chain link fence. I went down to the banks of the L.A. River, had to hop a chain link fence. Hey, we got to stop to Ben Jaffe. He wrote that song like Fourth Quarter Silly Jack. When we were doing that record, we were putting all our songs together, like you wrote that very quickly and brought it to the table.  And it was beautiful. And you know what else also is like when you guys had just moved here, you know, so this part of you saying, oh, I love my new home. Yeah.  And, you know, I hate want to abandon L.A., but I hate when things get really big and they're run by people who haven't done mushrooms, it bothers me.  Well, how do we get the mushrooms, Joe? How do we do it?  I don't think they know what they're talking about. I really don't I don't think they're right.  You heard all of them. I don't even want to say anybody's name, but you're sure said to me, this is what I think. I think we all need to understand.  There's a lot of messages that can be conveyed right now.  And you can't just constantly worry about what your side thinks. We got to figure out some way to get through this. We're all better off than we were before it started.  And it can be done. It can be done. They can all do it. It can be done.  Yeah. And it's being done in a lot of it is.  It's this is a fucking breakthrough moment, although looting and the riots will be in history.  It's terrible. It's horrible that it happened. But this explosion that happened, we we got a real shot at moving things forward in a really powerful way.  We've got a real shot right now. Well, when people are uncomfortable and we are really uncomfortable, yeah, that's when things move because you have to there's action. You can't just sit in it. And no one likes to be uncomfortable. So what the fuck are you going to do?  Hundred percent with everything in life, like if you have a bad moment in life.  It feels terrible, and that is life's way if you're playing this weird game of good and bad and love and hate and what feels amazing feels terrible.  You follow that, you follow whatever that is, you follow whatever that feeling is.  Yeah, I mean, back to Joy Diaz, though, a little bit, too. It's like you have these monumental moments in your life and how do you grow from them? Yes, and I have no disrespect, but I've always had a really hard time relating to people that are like I've never been through anything difficult.  Life's been great. I'm just sort of like, but you know what?  Probably this is true. But this is what this is what I think we all need to consider. It's not their call. They didn't say, hey, I don't want Suzanne to have this fucking dope ass life in Beverly Hills.  Fuck that shit. I don't live in Beverly Hills and I'm on a plane and I've been doing some cocaine. I know I know where my limit is with my unemployment.  But, you know, I'm saying musicians, you know, I'm saying I do this on your course. I'm there. Idealism. Paris Hilton didn't want to be Paris Hilton. She was thrust into this.  I remember her always in one. Of course I do this. Why I brought her. No, I know. But I told you last night. I told you, Cameo.  I think it was amazing this weekend. Take 21 Jump Street. I hate to say this because it's looks like counter. It's counter. It's almost like counter competitive, which is what is a lot of what America is. Yeah, there's some weird competition that fuels innovation, but I think it's like anything else, like you should only go so fast. Like if you're going around a racetrack, racetrack should only go as fast as you can go without sliding off the road and slamming into the fucking trees.  Right. Right. But you it can be done. It's been done. You can you can navigate it. And I think we need to figure out how much gas we need to give life.  Yeah. And if your objective needs to be to get around the fast, that isn't the only we're so driven into that mess. Yeah.  But sometimes it's nice to just have a nice drive.  Kruzan What a nice chase drive. Especially the convertible. Yeah. Fucking chillin man. Yeah. These days I've been really excited to drive, but also like you can't stop and pee anywhere so you can't go too far.  You know, for me as a lady like I was like I wanna drive up PCH, but like, you know, and I've done it. And then I was like, oh my God, I have to pee and there's nowhere to be safe.  And she we I wish it was safe to drive on mushroom's. I wish it was like a hundred percent is like Starbucks. Yeah. Just walk on mushrooms. I'm fine with that.  But if people said no, it's actually statistically been proven that you operate faster and more coherent while on mushrooms. So please. Yeah.  What's going on in Denver, by the way, decriminalized. I'm going to move in on it. I believe they're voting on it also.  It's still up in the air, I believe. Right. OK, if we turn the AC down, Olympia's that's OK. Endorsable, we're going to light a fire that's room being scared of. I'm scared of marijuana.  This you know, when I smoke it, I get.  Yeah man that's what it's forty five watts.  This is seventy five degrees. That's insane shit. Right Jamie. I'm saying just say boy come on.  All right. Listen, I'm sixty seven. I just want to say even though I'm embarrassed about this, but Jamie and I, we didn't need drip the other day and he got there faster than me.  First time I beat him he beat me. Dang smoked. I didn't realize I didn't he beat me by like four minutes. Right. Four solid minutes way. It's like let me be the first I've ever done it. Yeah. He went full out.  I don't know exactly what that is, but it seems it's some ridiculous thing that we do every week.  And I mean this is what's interesting about Jamie. It's like we there's a thing you do. It's called an RN, a drip. I forget what it's called. I forget the actual science terminology.  But it's it's basically some. Well, what would be the best way to describe it?  I don't want to fuck this up.  What is what is RN a D specifically.  I give you that I want to Wikipedia this.  I want to ruin it.  I want the idea behind it is it helps your immune system and helps your body recover. What's it.  This is a drip as an intravenous I.V. and also I do an IV vitamin bag and Jamie and I start doing this every week. Here it is. It feels amazing.  Man NSD is helping helpful for individuals undergoing therapy for substance abuse and addiction recovery. This treatment reduces cravings and withdrawal symptoms, provides energy to the body and boosts brain regeneration and adds IV treatments can assist with addiction recovery. But there's some other benefits to this is that's just one of them.  But it is really good for that. Apparently, it's really good for so substance since that compound.  Yeah, I guess it must be right. Right. Synthetics, weird work. It's like organic.  What's organic? Well, I think it's organic. I guess a bottle of organic because, you know, if you have antibiotics, it's organic.  I'm not sure you might be a fraudster shit.  What was confusing, Joe, I don't know. There's a lot of them. Yeah, they're hard to pin down. That's what people say. Yes. What the Buddha said, they're like most problems. It's with words.  You're right and they're right. That is what it is. Right? It's like that's what I was saying earlier. Those words convey intent. That's what they're supposed to do. I want to know what you think. I wonder if you think I mean or if you're just making a mistake in the way you communicate what you think.  Well, yeah. And I say I don't know if words convey intent because they're usually not that nuance. No, they convey an agreement which is, OK, this is or whatever the fuck this thing is called. Right. Here's a microphone.  That's a rat.  This is exactly the true intent is much more difficult to communicate, especially talking about digital communication. I need to see you how your body moves, how you're looking at me.  All this shit for sure. Yeah, we all I mean, that's the thing. That's why the threat of being canceled is so scary for people.  Right?  We don't ever want people to be mad at us because if we did something wrong and people are mad at us, if it makes sense, like, oh my God, made a mistake and everyone knows I, I got no friends, but we got to be real careful with, like what we get mad at, what we don't get mad at. And here's a great example that fucking everyone I'm not taking credit for this thought. Everyone has had this thought.  It is so fucking insane that you could get arrested for opening your business just a couple of weeks ago and you don't get arrested for looting that very same business like last week, your fucking Friday night, like what happened and you were going to put that guy in jail. If you look at what hits close to home for me is Long Beach, Tenth Planet, Tenth Planet, jiujitsu, Long Beach. I never trained there, but it's in a tenth planet family, tenth planet jujitsu.  I started out in in Hollywood and then now they're in downtown L.A. But there's a bunch of them at my my brother Eddie Bravo has like I don't know how many gyms he has all over the world, but one of them just burnt to the ground in Long Beach for no reason.  For no reason. That sucks.  You know, laws are made of words. Words don't make sense.  That doesn't know what means what doesn't make sense is that, you know what I mean. Anybody's frustration bounces off the wall of reality to the point where people get victimized. That had nothing to do with your pain.  Yeah, there's not a lot of friendly fire happening right now. I think we all want a lot of the same things. And and in that respect, looking for my orbit's gun because I'd like to chew it.  But in that respect, like, you know, we have like you have such a solid point, like the ridiculousness of the logic is like it's fucking overwhelming.  Like everyone's kind of saying the same thing, but they're still fighting.  And you're like, OK, someone someone needs to get on television and tell the looters until all the people that have stole shit, we forgive you.  Let's start from scratch. Let's let it go. Yeah, you fucked up, you got caught up in this crazy wave. And a lot of people say Fukumoto need to purge. Maybe they do, maybe they do. Maybe they do. But is that better for everybody? It's better for everybody. Is everybody realize what the fuck just happened?  We collectively lost our marbles as a society. America collectively lost its marbles.  When there's some marbles that are missing the whole fucking time and there's some marbles that are being pushed around point and pushed around by shadow character, shadowy, shadowy actors.  It's true. It's so dark and so dark. And I'm glad you brought that up.  Yes, there's darkness. There is one hundred percent agent provocateurs.  There is this has been the idea that this is not going to happen today at one of the most provocative and engaging encounters in the history of civilization as we know it in recorded media.  Right. What what year are the twenty. Twenty what year can fuck with twenty. Twenty. What comes through all this shit happening together all at once. Coronavirus three month lockdown.  I think the the onset of World War One in the Spanish flu could probably be likely to suck our dicks history close in terms of bodies and all that.  But we haven't realized the amount of time. Sure. That that is that that that took place.  And we never would have imagined in twenty twenty in where we are here in June that we would be here if you if I came to you in December and I said, bro, some crazy shit.  I've been thinking about that.  But you know what, it made me think of something you were saying earlier too. I was at this talk. It was about collapse. Civilization collapse. Where was it?  It was at the Getty Museum. Oh.  And the thing I took away from it was this guy says the future is here. It's just not evenly distributed.  Well, you know what I mean. Like, so we're you're talking about twenty twenty in the insanity of it. If you're living in Syria right now, you're like, what?  You know, we've been living in the point being all these different contexts. It's so hard to relate to ones other than what we perceive to be our own.  Yeah, that's a great way of putting it.  Yeah. And it's hopeful and intimidating.  And I think there's real limitations. We're hoping that we understand how you really feel when you say something.  We're hoping I think I got to say it again. We'll say it again. Say you say you know, it's like we have a different ways of saying things as soon as you have different ways of saying things. But yet you maintain that if you said I could take it and put it in print and everybody can know exactly what you said, that doesn't make any sense. There's no trust anymore.  There's no trust like we need Elon Musk's brain drill, bring it in, but we need to be nice to him. So I didn't think I was attacking him. He's going to work.  I'll mediate. I love that dude. There it is. He's a good guy. He really is.  You know, I thought, well, she's got his sorry in his old car registration up on her fridge.  I know. Oh, that's right. I want to talk about this, you guys. It's win for honey. Honey, the Cadillac Escalade. Well, who knows? Maybe he had a bunch of them. Who knows?  He has eight homes in Bel Air. He's like, I don't want a home anymore. Oh, how convenient. You have eight of them. You fuck. It's literally on the side of my fridge. The registration, it says Elon Musk.  Well, he bought Mars. That's what this is all about. And he bought it. It was for sale.  But you know what? I thought I was in that same podcast. He says I could either be designing my perfect home or I could get us to Mars.  I was like, why don't you design your perfect home, too? Maybe because we'll probably figure out some cool shit, because Hyperloop is going to put the Hyperloop together.  It's trying to make a new Tesla Roadster. He's got a Cybertron toilet, but I couldn't do both like a toilet or something. We need that. He just needs a Bill Gates will do that.  Back massage, the back massage, some electrolyzer gun. The gun thing is right there. There you go. I want to get was there a gun? He needs electrolytes.  Yeah, it's a lot of those companies. Tim Tams, a really good one, too.  He needs, you know, a real person, real person with an elbow rubbing in your back, hire a professional. Those are around. It's real. Look, people who are really good at that. Yeah.  You certainly used to be able to get massages, you know, I mean, like so first world not to.  Yeah.  Total fucking champagne problems, but I got a fucked up back and it's been, you know, I've been banished. What's wrong with you about all kinds of shit. Tell me these problems and back my back. I started doing helped a lot of my friends. So from the violin I've got like a left. Shoulder thing up the neck, but sometimes I just can't go this way, but it's more physical therapy that I just regular Lay was doing with like a chiropractor.  I was I'm OK, by the way. I was playing pool so much that I was developing this really bad pain in the middle of my back when I lived in New York. Because you spend so much time bent over to play pool eight, 10 hours a day or so, eight, 10 hours a day, I have bent over this fucking table looking at these balls.  Yeah, like a story my life. And you might imagine if you imagine like I'm trying to save for college every day, just balls, balls and baseball balls.  That's a lot.  I mean, that's a lot of time, dude. Whenever you think about or I used to read about a lot of drummers, you know, famous drummers and eight hours was kind of the magic number.  All these guys, Tony Williams, even Billy Corgan, a great guitar player, every time he talks about trying to get me to buy a drum set, I think about I'll give you one.  Just keep everyone on Amazon, OK? We lot of support Amazon or we not work enough.  I don't know. I saw some really cool stuff about supporting black businesses like buy your books on from like bookstores.  This is my thoughts on Jeff Bezos. He could be way worse. We should be nice to that guy and give him a hug and tell me, bro, I get it. No one's supposed to have one hundred and eighty billion dollars. So a lot of money. That's brown money.  Jeff, Jeff, I know we don't know each other, but I love you. OK, extend the olive branch.  You're going to be OK, man. We're all going to be OK. But we're not getting my podcast. I love you on Jeff Jeff Bezos order of Amazon.com. I'm really, really inspired by you. Good here. By Saturday, Kevin Kevin Hart was on the podcast last week and he was talking about Jeff Bezos, that he met Jeff Bezos at a party. He made a beeline right to him and his friend was actually urging him not to do those made there.  Kevin? No, Kevin did to his friends like, no, no, don't talk to him.  Like, get the fuck away from me doing this deal with me, Jeff. Or maybe it's anything I'd give Jeff.  Jeff Bezos sons like, to be honest with you. If I saw him at a party, I'd be like, that's a guy introduce you. Oh, fuck, Jesus Christ. If you want to be so good. I don't. I don't. It's not the place. OK, thank you. And I'll put you in whatever headlock I know how to do. I'll show you how to make a triangle. I'll show you how to tell me. As long as you wear black, face me, choke me and kill me.  You come on. I want to get the I want. I wanted to be so little racism. But that's not even a term anymore.  Yeah. Can we get to that. I think we can.  I hope so. We can get to the point where there's just morons, assholes and people you can hang out with. Yeah. I think we can get there more, you know, assholes, people you can hang out with people, people who love you.  I was thinking about you because you know you're a comic. And the thing is, like, it's there's a lot of things to make fun of. But people are so fucking sensitive right now and for for good reason.  Like, that's why I signed with Spotify. Yeah, I got plans, bitch. I'm riding this wave right under the rocks. Come with me.  I think about my bag. He's he's so good. We are that's that's what we need to move in. Twenty twenty.  He's like oh how long is this project has been going on for three hours.  Well it's worth a mere two hours less than the class sandwich.  What's the Kevin Smith one. If you had to guess it wasn't.  I want to say it's five hours when you weren't here. Who was. Yeah, he was here for the second one, but there was a really long one before.  Jamie, Jamie, Jamie, time I to Gary Clark after my last podcast, because I talked so much. Listen, don't you ever do that.  Well, I love Gary so much. I love him. I do. I love him so much. Do I love you. Love you. But I was really stoned. Everybody was great at freaking out. I freak out all the time, but I just want Gary to like. Yeah, all right. Ride the wave. Suzanne, I'm trying. I'm not a very good surfer.  What do we do? Angel of Death. Let's do what you got to do both. We'll do both. You have to see this one, because death is how I met you guys. I get my funk.  We're going to do let's do what you're going to do now first. Okay. I love that too. Let's do angel do whatever you cause I'm starting to get a little I'm pretty fucked up so listen it. Well, time is your friend.  Yes. It's only it's a little small. It's light out. Who could I tell.  It's light out. I can tell. OK, you know I have twenty six.  I support them. We're fine. I'm so thankful that we're all going to be fine.  This might be the first podcast we ever make, part one, part two. Jamie, what do you think?  How if we go straight psychedelics, we should totally do your part to think we should give a round of applause to young Jamie, who is perhaps the greatest podcast producer in the known universe.  Jamie, this bastard Grutness raps Ohio in a strong way. Oh, the best.  The best one handed Google Earth the world has ever known. Fastest fingers in the West.  He's he's telepathic. I'll start talking about shit. Teach me. I mean, weird shit hyena's.  You guys are like learning the brain at a screen. Yeah there's yeah. We are being degraded.  I think we've been degraded. Jameelah. Connected or neurolinguistics. Yeah.  We're if we're in the ether together what's what's wrong with my dad's darkish.  Oh sorry dad.  You guys are swapping guitars. Yeah we're kind of fucked up my guitar. I brought everything. I've said this before.  I'm going to say it again. One of the things I love about music is I don't even know what the fuck you're doing.  I got you know, I could say the same about a kettlebell of how I could teach you that. Right. Because I'm really good, really.  I'm good with the arms, OK, like the the core in some of the lips I want to tighten up.  He's going to film this right after here. We're going to go right over to the gym. I'm not sure I'm not kidding either right now. I could see my woop is not in the right place for kettlebell. See why my woop is on top when I do care about. That's what I do. It's a strap. Hey, where do I switch that bitch? It makes sense. The only reason that we're not in our lives right now other than depression.  So an age and how dare you? Me? Oh, sure. You're in the better the best shape of all of us combined. No, we're all going to be OK.  We got things all day on top of the line to get. How are you doing on your subject, soldier? If we had a drum set, we'd be a band right now. That's what I'm saying. That's what I'm saying. I'll play drums. Right? Come on.  Me trying to con me to give it a drum set. Everybody will learn and I'll learn. Jamie, what are you saying? Not to lose Jamie to Space X as soon as they figure out he can learn everything.  We've got a real problem. How do I lose them?  Teach him how to play drums. I mean, if he gets as good at that as he is, is one hand Googling. No, no. You know what I was thinking about that I had this, like, weird like I was like one day, like 20 years from now. And everyone's like when like Joe's like young Jamie.  Because that's where your voice is going, Joe. But Jamie, Jamie is your inspiration. Jamie Tadi look at this 90 year old rogard I wanted to see that. Doesn't matter how old Jamie gets, he's always been young in spirit. I know that when I met Jamie, I'm like, this is cool. He's just a fun kid. He's young, Jamie. It's a good crew. I had a ponytail back.  Oh yeah. I mean, I met young Jamie at the ice house in Pasadena. That's pretty awesome. We were talking about audio engineering last year as cool motherfucker.  No, this is a great crew you got here. Like things are going well. There's no crew. It's just. Jamie, I know this is a trick. Yeah. Like you took the same room. I'm just like we could have it here in Texas.  Oh, my God. There's always air travel international in there.  That's OK. When you get the spaceship, you guys out call us, you call us. And my thoughts about Austin are, if I do, I'm there 100 percent.  I'm just going to fly people in a fly.  Anybody in let's. That's cool. So, Jay, it's one day.  Let's be fair game, because by then the venues again and we'll just go there, play a show, do a podcast, hang for a week.  You got to give people the choice to do what they want to do.  Hmm. I don't know if they're right.  I don't know if we have to inform people and then we have to give them the ability to make decisions.  And I don't know if you're right. I don't know if I'm right. I know. Right. I'm scared. You're scared to talk. Yeah, that's what I do think. Clubs who are poor white trash people drive with masks. It's weird to think they're putting you in your own car. It doesn't make any sense and go in because you can afford this kind of interrogation. You're going to follow. They're going to fold up shop, you fucking pussy.  Hi. What's what why are you a masked guy? You're in your own fucking car. I'm this guy poison. I'm sure you're making the wrong choice. I thought you just said to me, that's the right choice. Listen, you're always going to have bitches. We have to. Everything is real. All things are real liars. Poets as true lovers.  Reeves, I think everything is real. We got to all accept it together, recognize bitches, flush him, wake him up in the morning, dead upside, then give him your love.  Could you imagine? I think that's part of what you're saying. Yeah, man, I'm I'm going to work out to this everyone to wake him up.  It doesn't happen on its own. You must force it. He must force all of it. Love, love, hugs, hug your friends. I love you. Was my imaginary friend. And a couple of my friends, Mike Young, Mike Young, I love you. I love what's happening. I love a lot of people.  We all love each other 100 percent.  I think that's pretty much the key. That is the key.  Unlock that door. The key is us. We kind of accept that we're all living in this fucking fantastic soup of possibilities. Oh, yes.  And we all come from different backgrounds, different deficits and different strengths.  Different different ideas, different perspective, different biases.  God damn, yeah, all these things, like we might look like we first of all, we should have a George Floyd Memorial, a big one, like a Mount Everest style.  Yeah, but why stop there?  The one with all the presidents, not Mount Everest, Rushmore, that one. Yeah. Do it, George. Floyd, come on, bro. Yeah.  How about if we did that. It's cool mansion one shitty cop for whatever.  Let's just let him get away with all the shit that he got away with forever.  There's a ton of complaints about that guy.  Are there. I didn't know. Oh yeah. Oh I didn't. I didn't.  Way, way, way, way, way back to the early 2000s. Right. Like twenty six was like his first complaint.  I ignorantly only just seen the video and that man had tweeted, that's insane.  Just to do it. He doesn't even care. I mean facts.  But if you tweeted it's like I think is Richmond Jevin Instagram Black Square because if you didn't lose my no.  Fuck you. I did. I didn't, I didn't can know but that me not to.  I can't I don't support the movement. I do but I don't know who the fuck told everybody to have a black square on fucking election days. On a primary day.  OK, even if most people said, OK, I'm going to post the black square and then I'm going to post my other shit, there is for sure a step back. Yeah, this for sure.  It was confusing the messaging on that one because I know where it came from. If I knew where it came from, if the weird thing on his Instagram anymore was saying we all need thank you friend to post a black square, the support that we love everyone. We love black people, we love Asian people, Polynesians, South Americans, we love everybody. If the rock, we just take the reins. I think you're going to I'm going to be his.  Was that dude Steven the one dude, it keeps getting trouble.  Bald guy, Polish or bald guy, Polish señores.  Steven Miller. Yeah, well that guy I'll be that guy's there for the Fox administration.  Is ice in that bucket, you know, back to the blackout thing, lyricism. I'd like to think that it wasn't some kind of weird conspiracy because I found it on Instagram.  Oh, no, no, no, I'm not kidding. I know you are not clear. I should be there and I don't want people to think I'm disrespecting that. I'm joking around. But one thing that I am I understand what it is. You want to know how many people are with you here.  Here's here's reality.  Everybody's with you. Everybody who has a heart, everybody who loves people.  Everybody loves Marvin Gaye and Mike Tyson and Muhammad Ali and Laurence Fishburne and Ice Cube and every fucking brilliant African-American artist across Richard Pryor and Eddie Murphy and Chris Rock and Dave Chappelle.  We love everybody. We love you especially. It's not a fair game. The game that African-Americans are playing is different than the game that you're in.  European American settlers, like my family is playing, we we drifted into this game that was established by slavery.  Yeah. It's not our game.  It's a different game. And for anyone to.  If we're going to progress, we have to acknowledge that this didn't start, it's not like everybody's like, OK, you all have four cards each with those cards with 40 points.  Do you get well when you're playing the game like society, if you want to think about what economic equality is or what just any sort of just community, like the way we feel about each other, what's equal and what's not. Hmm.  It's it's not 100 percent based on what you've done is a giant chunk of it is based on things that are completely out of control. Oh, of course. Right. But that's that's the thing that doesn't get talked about. Right.  If you want to talk about presidential campaigns or gubernatorial campaigns only, whether it's the Senate or Congress, no one says like, hey, hey, this is a crazy game.  This is a crazy game. And some people get a million chips and some people, oh, chips. The moment they're born, they're bad at the moment. They're born. Yeah.  And some of those people swim through those waters and become these incredibly powerful artists. And that's what's so fascinating about America. The James Brown's, the princes, the people that swam through that water who are extraordinary, the Marvin Gaye's The Muhammad Ali of Joe Frazier's the David and Goliath.  So many people know it's a thing.  I'm listening to the David and Goliath and Malcolm Gladwell book, but and it has a lot of that, like defying the odds in a lot of ways, you know, but but, you know, in terms of the black box that is in action that like to have a.  To do something like even if it's so simple as a digital action in solidarity, it feels powerful.  It does.  It feels like a recognition and a cognizance that is is a consciousness that, you know, you can sit here, you can sit here and thought, but when you start to open up a conversation or express yourself and it's scary, I've been expressing myself and I've fallen on my fucking face.  But I keep getting back up because I want to understand. And there's there's a real.  Can I stop you right there, please?  Yeah, but you weren't falling on your face when you talk to most people in real life, like the real video back and forth stuff.  No. No problems. No. Right. No, the problems, Twitter.  The problem is talking through text. Sure.  If anybody talks to you or you, you guys are really nice people. From the moment I met you, like we met in like 2012, you know, holy shit.  I think at the I guess that before us, I think we did that end of the world show in December of 2012, but then December 21st, 2010.  Yeah, for sure. Probably.  Yeah, yeah. Yeah. It might be out of booze if we don't don't drink that bend poor first we've put it he put a joint mind you disagree with him.  So take mind and pour whiskey in the joint. One I'll drink. That will be a bitch. No whiskey on that one point you're going to drink out of this. Some of the. I will. That's the point of this fighting. Guys, stop fighting over the whiskey. No, no, no, no. Don't drink out of that.  Or the whiskey like a drink. I don't want to sue you. You're talking about if I was in a bar and I thought of whiskey, you guys are here. There's a lot more glasses. Give me the joint glass. I'm not scared. I'm not scared of dirt.  What are we going to do? I'm not there's nothing to do. Share you. Look, you're lying. We charge you to stay alive.  Matsusaka the world unnecessary alive.  Yeah. We can't we can't give you this contaminated glass of whiskey.  Did you ever did. It's going to be.  I wish I could tell you what's going on in my body.  Just drink. No, no, thank you, chef. But to wants it. Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme it. Put whiskey in that whiskey and no more like a real drink. It's going to be ok guys. Jesus Ben, change your mind or bitch you're not going to get them feces with hookworms in it.  It's just. It's fine. It's fine. OK, but I still don't have been doing this forever. This is your point for glass and that's clink.  Clink Paul, what happened after this year is zero things.  No, I mean, it's a wake up call. They're going to start to start, you know, let's say I went in on that. So I mean, guys, I love you guys, too.  Are we talking a decade here?  I think we've been friends for far, reasonably at least nine years or eight years. It was that the first duty I remember I thought was in the ice house. It was like a side room I'm talking about was in Pasadena. Yeah. Yeah.  Oh, my God. Yeah.  You know, my friend Eddie Bravo is a really great. We've met him. Yeah. Yeah. But he's a really big fan of you guys and. Yeah.  And when you guys performed at that show where it was, it was you guys and Joey Diaz Daghestan.  Yeah. One of my favorite times of life. I wore a fucking suit. I never wear a suit on stage. You look dope as fuck. That's the only time I ever wore a suit in a comedy show ever was with us.  I was like, if we're going if the Mayans were writing the Mayans, we're going to go back and get this right, this Benschop.  But Eddie Bravo, who's like he's a real fan of music. You guys were on stage and he was like, God damn, these motherfuckers are talented. He's a sweet dude.  But it was really interesting because, like, Eddie had never seen you guys before, he didn't know who these people are. They're really good friends of mine. They're called honey, honey. I go and I start telling them this song, that song Angel of Death pop up, we start talking, let's get wrecked. And then we're sitting backstage and he sees you guys go on stage.  Oh, these motherfuckers attack. That was twenty twelve December 21st.  That was at the end. Thank you for it. Yeah. It was really special.  I love you guys. I love you guys.  One of the coolest things about having a there's a backstage I'm sure that's why Jamie took all these pictures.  Jamie had a great shot. A Sudan.  Oh you. So Hants, I actually had a suit made, but because they don't make them for chumps, I go, Yeah, yeah, there it is.  So I want to Yeah. That I wanted to ask.  Well, listen, I thought yes, he was there that had his own dressing room, I guess.  Oh I didn't come to hang out. Oh. Bellbird came down. I remember that night being like Oh yeah, yeah yeah. He's cool.  Well I felt like no no bullshit. There's a little there are plaid jacket. There's Eddie.  There's very few times in all of life where someone has the opportunity to to be the person who says, hey, we might all die tonight.  So they well, I think it was fill up a giant place. I want to get together with a bunch of my friends and let's love let's have fun.  It was so beautiful. Let's listen to music.  Let's talk some shit. That was you crushed it that night.  It was always a night. Was everybody everybody was really excited. It was a fun night. It was like everybody.  And even if it didn't happen and it didn't happen, here we are eight years later.  Everyone is OK here in the world. It was not supposed to end then. And I think this is the after. But we keep that place.  The Wiltern. What's it? That's one of the great theaters in L.A.. Oh yeah. It's amazing. Yeah. I hope they can open soon.  Just open up a place like that.  Probably be easier because there's chairs. You say no one sitting there, you know, I mean this is my motto. It's four words. Let people take risks. You let people do motocross and BMX.  And I got to tell you, I am mourning the live show.  It's been tough. Yeah. Yeah, it's hard and it's hard. There's a special connection you have to audiences, right? Yeah. Yeah, I feel that way too.  I'm sure you can kind of make songs with nobody around, you know, but I can't make any jokes I can make. Like if I had to write out my shit and then go out like randomly without ever trying it out in audience, I might, I might hit like 70 percent of the time. Yeah.  I mean, it's like thirty percent of my jokes are going to be terrible to see minus dude.  The pain of thirty percent of your jokes failing might kill you.  No, no, no don't. No, no it wouldn't me. But I'm just saying like 30 percent if you a lot of people paying money.  Your jokes. Yeah. And 30 percent die.  I feel like our set was like ten percent worked when we first started and we slowly like year over year, ten years it took us and we probably got to eighty five percent.  That's a fair assessment. Yeah I'm I'll with that but. Yeah but don't you selling that stuff don't you think. No bullshit that the eighty five percent you hit when you guys got comfortable was probably one of the most satisfying experiences. Oh yeah.  You could ever imagine because you know you went through the beginning.  Yeah.  Well and then we both also went off and did different projects and so sort of had different assessments of what that percentage spectrum looked like.  And, and now that we're sort of coming back to, you know, integrating our music together, it feels so differently, like we're both such better musicians.  And I like to think, you know, we've had our separate therapy and our our work and so, like, it's just feels different.  What kind of therapy you guys do? Oh, all kinds. I mean, oh, my God, you could the one I'm so jealous, I've always wanted to do know you stop doing Botox.  I can't. I could do more nontax. You did Botox. Shut up. Well, what about this guy?  I don't know. I don't want wrinkles. Young ladies want wrinkles. None of them. First of all, listen, stop shaming the Botox, Ben. I'm not sure if it was just a surprise and caught me off guard. First of all, yes, I've had Botox. Have you heard of Botox? Yeah, I've seen it. I've seen it. I know what it looks like now, like when I saw cat kill a squirrel. I know it's real.  I have proof is in the pudding. No, no. I'll tell you what. I don't fuck with my lips and. And these.  Thank you. I won't. I don't like that. Don't worry about your friend. No disrespect to the ladies that botulism.  I know, cause I just had this, like, angry line that was bumming me out and well, I did my life and like but you're you're the fucking Buddha of podcasting and the prince and the king of Spotify told you, I'm the Joker, whatever.  I mean, I wish there was something better that wasn't botulism. No, there is. And you know what?  I've done it twice now. I've done Botox twice. And that's a fact. No, and I there's all kinds of things you can do. I do well.  I have a lot of really great natural skincare this company called Epicure and that I really like. And then there's also laser light therapy. No joke.  Get your joint out of your whiskey, dude. On while I talk about getting Carriger.  Oh, he does.  He's like you, bro.  Hugi, I told you I'm making up for the fact that Jamie beat me in our weekly NZD IV drip match. That's how you win and that is how you win after this or what.  OK, I'm so damn sure.  All right. You've been lefton. Yeah. Oh, look at this. Getting in a fight. Can you see the instructor get you doing some shit? It's chilling. Some we want to do.  You want to hold plank and take and like I'll lose.  I want a whole plank to a diet. That's how I want to do it. But I'm seventy five.  I'm just going to say today D No words of life. Joe, you want to be in better shape at seventy five than we are now at thirty five.  Is your back feeling fine right now sitting in this chair.  Yeah I'm good. Yours is bothering. Yeah. What's bothering you. Lower back. Why did you, what are you doing wrong. Cause that's what I'm trying to figure out. When you say bothering, what do you mean. Like, just like an ache.  You can feel it all if you got to it. No matter how good you think about your dad, grab him by the shoulders. How's your team? No, no. He over pelvic floor, bro. Check that.  Got to address your key. Chimere fell down off a hoverboard right out here on our polished fucking concrete floors of the year.  Twenty, forty one coccyx like S.I. joint, but it's all the same area.  I'm saying he figured it out. Somebody else is explaining who was it. Zack better had us. That's right.  Zack better the guy who he broke the world record one hundred mile run who he ran one hundred miles faster than any human being has ever ran it.  He ran a hundred miles kind of the bridge. Who gives a fuck? You just don't know what it was like. Oh yeah. Oh are you kidding yourself? Are we still friends?  I don't want to stop because it means I lost the fight. I bought a pair of shoes. They are excellent because of escalator's.  So, Jamie, did you say something? Have you addressed your pelvic floor and healed yourself? Is that what you're saying?  Yes. Through a lot of like physical therapy, basically, but like almost basic stretching.  Can guys do keep his accuser? I don't know. I don't know. No, no, no.  It's not that he's like that. I just put up a quick picture. They look like stuff. Yeah.  I think it's another company I bought. I bought Saucony Socrates make it and they make a really good Altra. That's right.  Altieri, I'm going to ditch this.  Saucony makes a really good trochu too though. Stretch it out. So this guy ran one hundred miles in like eleven hours. How many hours.  Wow. So get around the track.  He also did it on a treadmill. Yeah. The treadmill was really. Really. But he broke the world record on unground for the fastest 100 mile ever, and I think I liked it better.  Sorry, he's an animal, but he's a really nice guy.  God, Will Forte Vibes has been over there stretching, is he? He runs in these ultras and he told me about them. They're flat, you know, as opposed to like the idea of the heel of a lot of running shows are running. Shoes are fatter. Oh, those are really not the way your body is designed.  I wonder what kind of like feet he has is how is his arch? I personally have arch. I have pancakes for feet. I have no fucking arch. I think I want to talk about me.  I think that I probably did could run on like Joe Rogan talking about Romare talking to him probably.  I think he could run on the moon. He he just runs it.  It's a mind thing more than anything like having a really good pair of shoes, whether it's Nike or Ultra or Saucony.  That's great.  But I was Cicconi. But whatever Saucony, I'm not weighing in on this. Jamie, sorry, I brought it up because it Saucony, so I don't hear anybody ever say it. I just read it.  So you're 100 percent right. Yeah.  Thanks for calling. Attention it up with Walshaw Forever, Walla Walla Walla.  It starts with a V like Walla Walla Walla Walla Walla. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. I get it. Yeah.  When I first started reading scripts I was like a lot.  Oh my gosh. Back I looked up but you know all of the things I mean things.  Well just like, just the like pronunciations, like there's so many variations and I say this from a place of earnest. I misuse a lot of words.  Me too. And and mispronounce them. And it's very humbling know.  Oh yeah. It's only humbling because I feel like I've been there.  You want people to like you need a bodyguard, you know, like a psychic bodyguard.  Mm. Almost everybody does like come on now get the fuck out of here.  Like one person gets it like this is like it's like putting over your idea.  It's Ben Jaffe. I'm real. Yeah. It's my bodyguard.  You don't need me. You got this. What. You're doing it. You don't need me because I have a paper or actually in fact we do. Yeah. Yeah, it so we're doing well. I'm trying to figure out how to how to Atrianfar.  So we're listen, this is what I think if I, if I do like a lot of people think you shouldn't do sponsors. This is what I think. Let me talk about some sponsors that I actually believe in and then let's pretend I never said it, OK?  This is also and then just go and make sure we take should we delete that part? No, no. But this but this way we know because all of my sponsors are like good companies that you want to buy a yeti cooler. That's a good cooler by Black Reifel coffee. That's great coffee.  But let's forget about all that. Are we really talking about you? What do we talk about? You tell. I'm really talking about life.  We're talking about honey. Honey. This idea that you've got to be scared, like scared of one, what does that have to do with Patrina?  Because if you want money and you don't need sponsors, it is one of the support of our fans.  Very good. I want sponsors. Buffalo, me, honey, honey, dot com slash patriot.  Yeah. Now we're I'm a patriot.  And before I do, I always feel weird about other platforms, even though you can't avoid it. I mean, like YouTube that somebody else's platform at this point our own platform is good enough for me.  Yeah. Want something to be said. Sorry.  I would submit that it's better to take money. From sponsors and they say, what, if any, sponsors you want to throw away just let us know.  But on Patria, your audience is your sponsors. It's the same shit. No, it's not. It's a bunch of grapes who want you not to talk in person, who's voice who's who's telling you to do it or the people you send you to commentors.  Well, who gives a shit? You said that the first time we met. The first time we met, you were like guys, I'm you're you're.  Would you like me to go get the drum set, for God's sake?  I think there's a this would be a good room for it to compromise here is baffling in here.  It wouldn't be overwhelming. You can. What's baffling? You could.  So a absorptive substances and textures, you know, 90 percent. I mean, out there on Duncan. Great. Don't know what you're thing. You go out there, it was some sort of a selling job bombing.  Sound baffling. Yeah.  That's a good spot because you're going to have a drum set. Where would you put it? In this room. In this room. Well, you're but I put it in that corner, actually the door except for the door.  You get a bump anyway. I'm not I'm just sayin you go someplace they can't be changed to you, to everybody else. So you just walk to that. You're a member. Don't understand the connection. No flexibility. That corner right there.  Right there that I think that corner here, my heart of gold, I'm scared right here.  What I actually make this for the record, I'm going to say I'm going to wait until things calm down, you see.  But you didn't have to do that. You didn't have to drink the joint. You make a difference to anyone. I did. You guy this guy, but I did. You didn't have to. But I did.  Yeah, that's true. That was fun. And I celebrate that. I celebrate both. Yeah.  We couldn't do this today.  It wasn't for each other. A hundred percent. I probably as many times as could be a drinking beer.  I hate to do this, but I'm going to assume the you know, I love you. I love you back. I love you. Love you too. But you know. Right. Oh yeah. Like when we were silenced.  Who do we like with a guy we know. We know it was going to be hugs and we've known each other for ten fucking years, then said we had a relationship development yesterday.  And you said to me, go on about I said, Ben, I'm really excited for our drive to Joe Rogan because I think we should listen to run the jewels and get super pumped up.  Oh, yeah. My Suze revelation.  And you said, oh, well, I've just been realizing you just like to get excited.  Like it doesn't matter what it is, it's the act of no matters what it is exciting. It's exciting to you. But yes.  And I know that was new to understand by you.  I've known you for fifteen years ish. And like, I just felt like, oh my God, you get it.  Yes. I love to be excited. And you supported me in that moment for president.  Yeah. So what are we doing?  We're doing our work.  How do we how we work in this company when it's tight NFC, we're going to fuck the slo mo.  This is what's that movie with Schwarzenegger? The Terminator, you know, the one we're shooting.  Conan the Barbarian, fighting for their lives. Kindergarten, the kindergarten banani.  We get pregnant. Junior. Junior. That's what I meant. Was not called Junior is called Junior. There's really no time for movie. You fucking see, it was you know, it's none of us were alive. And I came pretty sure it was kindergarten. You I was listening to this podcast is released.  I don't know. But you know what? I don't give a fuck anymore. I don't listen.  We're going to be fine. We're going to be fine. No, I just want to be my real self all the time.  Does the thing this is it. There's a thing that's happening because of the lack, the lack of like if you you hear someone's words, you kind of get it.  If you hear someone's words repeated by somebody else, you don't really get it. If you see the written down, you barely get it.  Oh, that was amazing.  Guttural. That's what's happening. That's not a beautiful thing about music. Sorry. Yes, you're right. It transcends your time entrance.  I can play amazing music and fucking Bach wrote that down and now I can experience the same ish thing I got to be to care about everybody.  Inside the box is chicken pox. You heard it. You heard it here. We could look that up. I think we should see know. It's so good they wear wigs. Let's not before I get angry, I don't like this, Joe. No, it's so special, though. You look so hard to believe.  They are so proud of you for doing this. Oh, yeah. My what a girl ever tells you something that's so special. It's fucking awesome.  First of all, fucking rip that shit, bro.  Oh, there we fucking are, Joe.  You got to give me this, you know. Yes. Yeah. I need to talk to you.  What do you mean? No one on the right. Joe, I thought you said you love me. Oh, now I get it.  OK, it's this fast MTV music video. Yeah. Who's that cowboy. What?  He's going to stop his car, which is a bunch of hooligans.  That's the Backstreet Boys. And you check his glasses on, take it from him. He doesn't even know where he is on his door.  He can't see you like it's what needs to be done to it needed to be done at that time. Why the way it's what needed to be done.  But it's just it's just Backstreet Boys stuff.  Do you know where the wigs came from?  Syphilis. Come on. Syphilis because people were losing their hair. Yes. Holy shit.  Do you have syphilis? Do you know I got my hair growing expression. Do you know big wigs?  It's wrong with this girl. She's awesome. That's what's wrong with her.  She's awesome. And she's drunk. Thanks, Joe.  Have you ever heard of the expression big wigs? Mm hmm.  That's from guys with huge wigs with their fucking hair from syphilis. It was terrifying. Yes, it was starting from these royal brothers.  Why was that James out?  That was like France or something? It's looking like one, by the way, who's better than Jamie?  One hand zero people. Jamie is the best Shaney.  OK, so these two guys also looking pretty good, though. What year was this? Can we talk about Jamie's biceps?  You can if you want, but let me take my pants off. Sorry, but I, I, I admit to objectifying my friend Eric, but I make that bigger and worse epidemic since the black death in the.  So it syphilis because, you know, they were living with a long hair, was a trendy status symbol on a bald dome.  Could stain and repeat.  Why didn't they go the other way. That's unfortunate. We're all bald. No, no. They live without the internet boki.  Right. But they became guys. I am I am on another planet. Right. Those are real mushrooms.  Oh, I don't know who grew up here watching me make that could put that of this clock.  I wish there was. Is that does the person who makes these clocks continue to make them or can we get a clock.  It can, yes. You can't thank you for saying that. He's awesome. That's all I'm saying. That's what I'm trying to figure out.  Their dope, right? Yeah. Beautiful. What are those things called the those tubes?  They're just like the same thing that could put in. I could totally make that guitar amplifier set in the tube.  Nancy Nixey. Wow. Yeah.  And really beautiful hardwood. Yep. Love it.  There's a lot of great shit in your undeniable about wood, about a beautiful wood connected with electronics.  We still talk about Jamie's biceps not moving south. We're moving to a state that's helping Georgia state the pelvic floor. We're sorry, not sorry.  I'm not your girl and you're in love. Go on and you get Jamie's tank, you see makes you tubes.  He's more machine than free to go and pledge allegiance to the new world order.  Right?  To Jesus. Oh, wow. Here we are.  I think they're from Russia. I don't trust any of them there. While way design. I love. Highway a away for a while because of the Rabo, because of the what's that sorry, like a camera lens, but because I like taking photos of the other side project.  Jamie, it's not like it looks like you like it. I have one, Sergie.  No, I'm talking about the Norway. Oh, no. Did you put this lens. So it was a lie, not a lie. But I read into it. They hired they hired like engineers to produce like a style image. Oh, they're using software and whatnot.  OK, I didn't actually have, like, a glass. I mean, let's be honest. The iPhone takes a great photo. And I also I have a little Fuji film with a 50 millimeter lens that I love. And it it's really fun to learn how to use. I'm getting there.  But overall, the the wall weighs whatever, but nobody else is back and ask them to hell bent. What's going on. That's what I literally.  Is it. Is it your Brundle again going there. You don't need to go, Jamie. You know a lot about like photography and Georgia don't.  Do you think that there's like certain colts' of brands like Sony versus like for like for a long time it was Canon versus Nikon, right?  It's like Apple vs. Android.  Yeah. There's a thing to do with hunting optics, too. Like, I use a lot of different stuff.  Like A has a whole different brand. Yeah. Yeah. Oh. Beyond cameras and whatnot.  Yeah. But it's like they're all good though. It's like they're in denial that they're not all good.  It's very highly engineered glass from hundreds of years and well proprietary.  It's so hard to detect differences like guys have to get them on tripods and like stare through the lenses and look at a parakeet and gosh, that is close.  It's kind of the indicator. And then they look at another one. This is like a lens cut in half.  What the fuck? Well, like this is that's really I don't think anybody it's looking that's really small.  I don't know the actual number size can describe it like this is really probably only a two or three inch lens. And there's all that mechanical stuff going on inside there.  There's like one, two, three, four, five different. What is the aperture get down to? So it runs from two sides or like sixteen.  I don't know this one in particular, but it's probably like a two point four point zero eleven thousand dollar lens search that's going on.  Yeah.  Well, why did people with links like but this is why it's so expensive is because they put all this into a tiny, tiny, tiny little package. Like it's like I'm saying it's just I can't show it on camera, so I don't have it.  But it's like, wow, two inches by two inch or two inch cylinder. Yeah. And DSL, our cameras, that would be similar to that. The lenses, three to five pounds. Right. Maybe eleven pounds. And they some are like two feet long.  That's huge. That's too much. No. And I to, you know, 12 inches ever in my park, Josep, hot dogs, what do we do now, guys?  Yeah. Oh my God. How's everyone feeling?  Stephanie, breathe. Let's swim half our way out of this shit.  That's the breathing technique. Was his do you swim half for.  Yes, he's the first guy I ever talked to, didn't give a fuck if I breath out of my nose.  Or out of my mouth. Go ahead, people, send me videos of this man. This is an and then a certain dance between the cold and your breath begins to start up, begins to shock you.  This guy, after 25 breaths like that, very conscious in the cold.  The cold is a forest and it has his impact. I love you go along with the cold and what it does in the face on the physiology and you use your breathing. Now I know what happens physiologically, but then those days it was all by feeling.  And what does happen physiologically are you become a fully charged?  The carbon dioxide goes out and oh, to begin to roam freely throughout the body and fills up every cell and P.H. levels go up.  Now, when you say you altered your breathing, what you show me here is just breathing in and breathing out. Like what is split specifically different about that, the normal breathing there.  The way I used it, uh, it was like after 25 breaths, I was so fully charged, uh, I could stay like five to seven minutes under the ice every time, very controlled, that there is not only a whole lot of oxygen inside the body and but the levels go up now.  And later on, I began to understand I signed by by taking it saturated with oxygen, deducting and all that.  I, I saw that that we are able to tap into the brainstem, the adrenaline we showed lying in bad people producing more adrenaline. Now I know how to show to people just in the couple of days, that means every listener right now is able to do that.  So we have proven this scientifically and it showed that people lying in bed were able to produce more adrenaline than somebody in fear going for its first bungee jump, bungee jump.  And when you're still I'm still confused as to how you're doing anything differently other than deep breathing.  You're taking a deep breathe in and deep breathe out.  And now we return from breathing after exhalation.  Retender, we stop breathing, OK, exhalation, crunch, breathe in, like show me the method, like if if you if you go with me all right at 30 times, OK, let go fully and once again fully in letting go.  Right on Phoolan, but letting go, not fully out, just letting go, but fully in, once again, I want to get come up, don't hesitate, give it to him.  It's about changing the chemistry right now in your body. So I'm afraid you'll become lightheaded.  And at a certain point, you're so fully charged and P.H. levels go to a very high level.  You are able to stay without in the long four minutes, but just keep on feeling as understanding, go on and deeply in a light and go deeply in that and go deeply in and go ten times more deeply in that and go deeply in that and go I'm going to time.  I didn't go deeply in.  I had to go it fully take him in letting go, take him out and go take him in. Letting go. No hesitation. I do this with Overeem as well and he feels wonderful. Take him in, pull out and go all three them out.  I'm like OK five times more deeply in that and go deeply at that and go deeply in.  Let go two times more letting go and stop. Just stop witness without any DeLong's you are able to stay much more than normally that normally. Why. Because we change your chemistry. Carbon dioxide went out oh. To end up fáilte up all the cells and the levels go up. Then we are able to tap into the central nervous system and at the end we got the brain stem and that's the plays of the pineal gland. The hypothalamus, pituitary gland and the pineal gland makes the secretion of adrenaline in dangerous situations.  Normally we do not get into it because of our shallow breathing. This is the way to get into the most primitive part, the reptilian brain without many difficulties and fend off bacteria getting better into the endocrine systems.  We talk about it later. Your past one one ten in minutes and you're still on that shows that the capacity to fill yourself up with oxygen is a lot more than we normally use.  And as we do not use it, we are not making a use of the full capacity of our physiology.  Now, we found out we got a different layers and we never use it. And this is the way to learn to use it, to tap in and back into the primitive brain, into the endocrine system's immune systems, the way nature has meant it to be. Everybody is able to do one forty five and this is only around one. If it would do like three rounds, you would go to three minutes, four minutes without air, without training.  It only shows the capacity to store up oxygen inside. We never use that. You're doing great and you're doing already two to five, almost to ten. Whenever you feel the urge to breathe, you don't need to force is only learning how to energize the body in older cells. You go to great man now your field good. Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's OK. Two thirty. Yeah.  When you feel the urge to breathe, you breathe in fully and keep it for 10, 15 seconds, then that's when I'm fully in and keep it.  And now you press your belly. Yeah. The neck and then the head, and now you are able to tap into the brain stem and yeah, that's it.  That's insane. How weird is it?  Do it again that we need to breathe. You don't even think about it.  Need gas. Yeah. In your your cell says, it hit me when he was talking about shallow breathing because when I was really dealing with insomnia, that would be like this thing. Yeah, like I could.  I never felt like I could. I just didn't have that capacity.  I want to say to something you talk about. I talked about it today. Singing is a healthy expression of that kind of breathing. Sure. Yeah. I injured my vocal cords and had to go through therapy and this style of breathing, this is something was addressed and learned to do. And it was incredible how fast I healed myself just through breathing.  Mm.  There's there's also something in when people talk loudly, whether they're singing or speaking, there's a thing that we do where we train the vocal chords. Sure. Yeah. Yeah.  And that's been a crazy. We were talking about it today, pushing when it comes to your breath and singing is completely antithetical to what you're trying to do.  And now you're like caught up in the momentum of trying to get people to pay attention.  Yeah, but someone like Marvin Gaye or James Brown, they're so calm in those moments, or at least in relation to that behavior that they're able to resonate with their bone structure in a way that makes you react emotionally.  Yeah. Because they're so connected to their breath.  People thought Ginsburg talked about Bob Dylan that way, he said he got to this point when he was kind of his peak in the 60s of that power, he said Dylan became a column of air.  He just breathing.  He just turned into a focused breath.  I think that Sturgell, when he nailed it. Mm hmm.  He's an incredible artist. Yeah. Sturgell he catches this fucking vibration with some of his songs like Jesus Christ.  He's special. And I think he's lucky it came so late for him because he had so much ground underneath him that you can make real artistic decisions.  Yeah, honey, I feel like that about Nathaniel Rateliff to like he's he's got came later for him to almost all.  I mean, it doesn't mean you have to have it like Taylor Swift could be like amazing. I can't you don't have to define her by who she was like X amount of years ago was all bullshit.  But the reality is like whatever it, whatever it is, it's how you address it and how you express it. Yeah.  And when you get a guy like Sturgell that was working on the fucking railroad until he's like thirty six.  Yeah. It's authentic as fuck. He was working out well. Yeah.  Ryan Bingham. Ryan Bingham is a friend of ours. We've toured with him a bunch.  He's, he's similar in that like like I remember Ryan Bingham. He's beautiful man.  He was in, uh, Jeff Bridges, Jeff Bridges movie Crazy Crazy Heart.  And he wrote me he wrote that he already won an Oscar for it and he dedicated his Oscar to his wife, who was really beautiful. But Ryan Bingham, we toured with him a lot. And and I remember saying, Ryan, I love you like you have such great teeth. He's like this today, real.  I got my teeth kicked out by a bull when I was 18 and I was like, right, sorry. Got you. Feel like he is he is just like he is a cowboy.  He's from Texas. He's an incredible songwriter and he's a wonderful person.  And he's one of those that you're just like that is the real deal.  And, you know, we're all the real deal and our real different ways, you know, and like but like some people have had, like, acutely different paths like Sturgell. And it's just like tip of the hat, man. It's it's really, really special.  Like everybody. It's all different. Yeah. So you saw contests, see who is fucked.  No more. Not that's not what I want.  That's what's another music thing is that's a medium you just expressing. It's not accomplishment because it's different from sport.  Sport offers different shit but with music. The people with the clearest expression of self are the communicators as opposed to this this degree of of achievement. And I think that's just a beautiful and linguistic part of it.  You know, it's weird, right? Because sports like I want to dunk on you.  You want to talk to me, fuck you. Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Competition's an interesting thing in terms of development. You know, like it helps people excel, but it also represses people. It's like that. Like big fish in a little pond, little fish in a big pond thing.  You know, this is the problem. Competition without compassion. Hmm. It's not that competition is bad. Competition is good. But being a dick is bad.  And the promise, the two of them goes that. Yeah, that's really the problem.  Yeah. Yeah. Is that people that want to win in competition, they can also be a dick.  Yeah. It's not necessary.  Which is why would I be for the last time I was about to bring it in my internally just like wow you had like three balls on the table. Susann shot that eight in the corner.  I was like no all bullshit. Susann Santo can play a little ball. I notice he didn't mention me as well. So then you play a little ball as well, like a lot, but you never beat me, bitch, be at least one game. But in your defense, we were super fucked up. You were definitely super fucked up. But we were having fun.  Like, we started talking about Spotify and I couldn't hit a ball, but I don't know what happened. Yeah, it was I guess I don't even believe like I don't believe in going to sort through your shit on Spotify.  It's the same people, man. It's like Spotify can't have iTunes.  Yeah, but I mean, I don't know how many carry over people there are between both platforms. Yeah.  I'm just saying like, well maybe I guess you can absolutely search it on Spotify.  I don't know. And you definitely can search. Yeah. Yeah.  So just I was just thinking. I don't know, I'm talking about I'm. Stop talking. No, it's all right. Thanks guys.  It's weird. It's weird. It's just a different move into a new platform. It's weird.  Yeah. Yeah. And it's mostly a mobile thing. I guess that's why I always want to think Spotify.  I think my phone, you know, I mean, I think YouTube. I think on my computer. I mean, I do but but I think you can see it on everything.  Yeah. You can listen on everything. Right.  Is there a timeline with it. Like charts, September. It starts and then it becomes only on Spotify in January.  Well, I don't know. That's fucked up. Did YouTube counteroffer. There is no conversation, no conversation, no interesting YouTube.  There's nothing I don't have anything against YouTube, especially since I'm so drunk.  No, you are not, sir. Yeah.  How we work out. We definitely can see nothing wrong with anything less risky.  Ben. That's a good thing, but, you know, the thing was like Spotify was like, let's do this shit together, OK?  Yeah, this dangerous these waters are fraught with peril. Well, now you're taking down ships.  I mean, monetizing you were already global before, but now it's like like it's just it's great, man.  I'm like, thank you. Honestly, I've been friends for a long time.  Yeah. And I don't understand any of this. No, but you do something important.  It's special and like I said, rigidly accept it, accept whatever.  I'll just I'm going to tell you, I'm telling out what I've earned or it's weird for me and for you.  It's hashtag powerful how she just did it. I did it. Jamie was a time on this path so long. It's six thirty now for thirty four hours and thirty minutes.  I already had the work technically on my part too. I don't have to do some magic here to get it together. Oh Jesus. So we wrap it up right now. Let's play one song.  Let's play what you're going to do now, because that's all I can conjure up for you. I mean, please. I'm with you. I'm with you. For fuck's sake. Hold on. There's a technical issue.  No, right. I think we're fine. If it's not, I'll figure it out.  OK, we're going to we're going to play what you can do now, because that's and I'm about to meet you. I love that song. OK, so that's great news. Listen. Yes. I love you guys. This is so exciting.  Right.  So what's the most exciting about this is this is one of the rare OK, the most exciting thing is not just that I love you guys, but it's also this is a rare moment where people get publicly fucked up.  Yeah. And just.  Yeah.  And we could talk about our problems and like it feels like let it fly baby. What are you going to live forever.  It's it's nice to do a four and a half hour podcast with you when we haven't seen you together in so long and. Wow. Really big time is it. No bullshit. It means a lot to me. Oh my God. When I first met you guys, I wasn't even performing at the Comedy Store.  What? Oh, that's right. Because right now I met you guys during the boycott era.  It's right that, you know, I love you guys. You're awesome. Oh, my God. We love you too much.  All right, let's think listening to the people and saying to Joe and Jamie.  Oh, baby, the fire is coming down right in New Orleans, right in your mouth.  And everything you just asked on the ground. Oh, so what's he gonna do now? So you're you wanted to see. You sift through the rubble and search the debris. But you won't find anything if you don't find peace.  Oh, so what's he gonna do now?  Don't wait till you die.  Because you can always change your mind, make you.  So why are you still waiting outside, maybe your mom, I need to reach you, right, maybe Jesse and see last night.  You know, I don't give a damn why you want to fight.  Oh, so what are you gonna do now?  Don't wait until you die.  Because you can't change your mind, make it right. So I. Are you still waiting outside? So Carmelle from Louisianian, imams. Oh, babe, I know the dark, you know, again, I'm you.  Yes, I had my conscience ripped me apart, too, so here's what we're gonna do now, take all your needs and all your sins in.  The. Carry the weight if you breaks every little one. That's what we're going to do now.  Don't wait until you die.  Because you can always change your mind and make it right. So I'm still waiting outside. Still waiting outside. You still waiting outside.  Oh, beautiful.  Thanks for having us, Jill. Thank you so much. Please do. Angel of death now for me, ok.  It's OK. It's going to be sloppy though. I'm going to take my headphones off. I'm going to use some gum because my throat will dry. All right, Joe, you asked for it.  Please.  Literally, I feel like this is what brought us together or no. No. OK. I honestly might need to go to the lyrics.  I know I got Jimmy's got you. Hold on, Tuna. We haven't played this quite like once Jamie's got you, don't worry. Don't tell anybody I said that even if this is on the Internet, what exactly?  Here it is, Ben. We got this. We got this. I got you. I haven't drank in a month, but I had a great time. Tony. How fun was this fun? Oh, my God. Right. Yeah, I wish I was a 14 year old girl. You are. Oh my God. So fun. Yeah, so fun.  It's the funnest. The most fun, funny guys, the fact that we could do this. Oh, my God.  Stay there and get blasted by publicly blasting public Tagget uploading. I wait until I find you. Bury myself deep inside of your heart.  You won't feel a change will just become the same. And never spend a single day. Oh, yes. I guess there have been many others.  Oh, yes, I treated them the same as you.  And I licked the salty t is a cry, and many went from many to feel.  Keep your hand on your chest, don't let me whisper in your ear. It's best to keep talking. Lock the door when I come knocking blinds the boys, she never only repeat. And they will be shocked by this in Minton's because things are really.  They see. Oh, I don't mean you harm by my existence.  And just let your tired slip into your. Because is a death Dalian, Disney. Keep your hand on your chest. Don't let me restrain you. It's best to keep on walking out the door when I come knocking. The boys never want to be. Yeah, mine's the voice you never wanna hear.  It brought us together many a year ago. Oh, my God, that was awesome.  I mean, we are in it, guys. We are in the we finished the bottle of booze.  Do we really holy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. We getting real problems.  But no, we got mushrooms. Well actually I want to bring change one of those cameras around judiciously. Wow.  And we're going to with the fuck that. You know.  I know. Advice for white space for us and we're going to be OK.  This is a safe space. Thank you so much. Thank you. So this is the best time. Thank you so much. I can't tell you how lovely this has been for me, too. I love you guys.  You guys are awesome. You know, ever ever since I met you, I knew you guys are cool.  I'm really excited that you're friends with me and that you make this music that makes me feel like there's music that makes me realize that there's a purity and expression.  You know, like sometimes people put out stuff that, you know, you just listen to it and you go, oh, yeah, that guy is telling the truth or she's speaking from the heart.  This is real.  That's what you guys do. So for me, you oh, your mom, a Spotify, keep it coming. I'm Chester Young. Jamie, Amy, Jamie one Amy Google of all time. Jamie, honey, honey. Back in March in 2001 in the Yellowstone Volcano Tour. I want what? I want one. Cannot everybody keep it fresh, keep it in the basement, keep it away from drones. Oh wow. That was tight. We did it.
