Delicious and distinctive. Now's a good time to really get into beer. Just hanging out at home. What are you doing. Where are you going?  Blue Moon was created during the nineteen ninety five baseball season at the Sandlot Brewery at Coors Field in Denver, Colorado. Blue Moon founder and Brew Master was inspired by the flavorful Belgian witts that he enjoyed while studying brewing in Brussels.  That's when you're stepping up your game.  Men go to Brussels to learn about making beer carefully crafted, unfiltered interpretation with Valencia orange peel for a subtle sweetness.  Coriander provides balance. Oats create a smooth, creamy finish. I don't know what any of that stuff means, but it tastes good. It's delicious. I guess that's like how they make it delicious. Listen to me. It's very good. And as someone was saying when they were tasting the beer, they said a beer.  This good comes around once in a blue moon.  So they're like, take it, write it down. It's very good, though. I love it, I've been drinking it for years, when it came up as a sponsor, I was like, that's easy, I love that shit.

Blue Moon Brewing Company. Golden, Colorado Ale, my guest today is one of my best friends, you might know him from The Fighter in the Kid podcast or the below the Belt podcast or the King and the Sting. He does so many things. He's my brother. Give it up for Benschop government right now.  The Joe Rogan experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. Quarantine, baby, how are you holding up, getting through, man, the weirded out or just accepting it? I'm accepting it and I'm trying to stay positive. I send you guys all the positive stats I get.  Well, I know several people that have gotten it and gotten over it. The worst was Michael Yo.  And I need to confirm this with Michael, but I'm pretty sure Michael had a cold and then caught the corona and then got pneumonia.  Jesus Christ, he got it real bad. He's bad. He got it real bad. He was hospitalized for a week. His post choke me up. She's in.  Yes. And you see him coughing while he's doing it. Yeah. He's such a good guy. He's the nicest guy. He's the nicest guy. If we lost him, it would be fucking it'd be a shame. Devastating.  I know people that have gotten it, gotten over it. Not not much of a problem, you know, and they just felt like shit for a couple of days. Then they're fine. But that's the majority of people I know. People get upset when I say that. It's true, though. It's true, though. Those are the numbers. Budgewoi, the people get it and they're fine.  Yeah.  What I'm hoping is they come up with a legitimate treatment where it's like this is confirmed that if you take Hydroxy Clore Queen, you know, with the ZAGG, if they say something like that, this is confirmed.  If they say we got it covered, folks, we no longer have to worry about people dying of coronavirus. We just catch it real early, sort of like Tamiflu or some other things that look staph used to fucking kill the shit out of people tongues, you know, kill a lot of people.  Infections kill a lot of fucking people. Now they give you antibiotics. I mean, imagine if jiujitsu killed people. Imagine if you went to the gym and you got staff and you died, how many fucking people would train? I wouldn't train no one train. You'd be so terrified of staff. Right.  Well, that's how we are right now with this coronavirus. We're worried because we don't have, like, a rock solid, legitimate treatment or a vaccine.  But that hydro corradini, whatever the hell it is supposed to, supposed to work the trials that they've seen, right? Yeah.  For some people, you know, that was what they call anecdotal evidence. It's not 100 percent proven clinical trial, peer reviewed where they can say, hey, we had 160 people that were coronavirus positive. We put them on this hydroxy Clore takes a lot of time.  It takes a lot of time. We don't have time. Right.  But the guy there's a few doctors in New York that have implemented it and some some very positive results according to them. Now, is that that enough to, you know, to say, hey, we're good? I don't know. I don't think so.  I think what's funny is in our group of friends, you have some who are they won't step a foot outside their house. They have some who are kind of in the middle. They have some three who are super Lucio's.  You know, it's it's like it's just like the Rolodex.  The real problem is with people who are or are compromised, old people, you know, people whose immune system is already fragile.  And now the thing is, if you or I got it, we'd be fine, hopefully. But then what if you gave it to your grandma?  You know, don't go around your grandma dumb. Don't go around your grandma.  This is the real I think the real way to handle this moving forward is probably going to be something along the lines of make sure that old people aren't exposed, make sure that high risk people are not exposed, and make sure that you don't expose yourself to them if you have it correct and then get your ass back to work.  Yeah.  And hopefully there's some sort of a treatment, but get your ass back to work is really important. Hell yeah. It is. So many businesses going under anything we've seen anything like this scarier than ever. And I don't think ever in the history of America, there's been a thing where everything just like instantly shut down.  No one works, no one does anything. Everyone stays home. When and how long are we going to do it for them?  Right. I think they're saying the end of May now. Really? Courneya That's what I've heard.  California, the the governor's kind of a pussy. And he's he was talking about, you know, we might go on it might be like this for a year, you know. So did he say. Yeah, he said that.  So again, he's a giant pussy. But when you hear Trump, he was talking to some reporter, that's a question. And he said, I'm thinking, you know, we're not far off from after Easter. Open things back up.  Mm. Yeah. Look, if there's someone so tough, it's it's so tough. Like, look, if it's just us in this room, I'm not that worried because I take a lot of vitamins. I'm in the fucking sauna every day. I have a very strong immune system fit. I take probiotics.  You walked in, I said, I will lick your face right now. I said, What are we doing? Huggin, what are we doing? I look your fucking face jail. I'm not scared of shit. I'm healthy as hell.  Yeah, but that's the difference between someone who's actively taking care of their body and does so all year round. Yes.  Versus people who are always boozing, have high blood pressure, are overweight.  I'm talking to you because you're always talking about what a little of them look, I love the guy.  I don't want them to die, too. There's a lot of people like that, though, that we're friends with.  That's on you, homie. Get in shape, dude. Yeah.  If it if it bounces right off you. But it. Kill someone that's your age. Whose fault is that if they're severely out of shape? It's kind of their fault on humans, kind of their fault, unless they have a disease. And then there's people that have animal. Yeah, there's people that have diseases. And those diseases prevent them from being healthy. That's a different animal.  So then you have to think about that percentage of the population. There's so many variables, dude.  I went to this market at this giant market was selling bats. No, but I would have bought one of bats, not pursue, I'd say. But yeah, there's like this fresh market and there it was, Pacman. Oh my God. But everyone had a on. That's all too. Like, I'm trying to be funny. The PRI equal 800 pounds, one PRI 400 pounds. His wife, another four amount's with mask on. Like, if that's what you think, the mask.  That's what that's not what's going to kill you homies that are already you. Yeah. You're super fucked. Thin out the herd, man.  Well, I hope this is a wake up call for people that aren't taking care of themselves because there's a lot of people that just think it's not necessary and they look at someone like you or I that's vain that, you know, like so like, I hope to not get up in the morning, look at my body in the mirror every morning, every morning.  Look good.  I guess I'm straight up old school, Mr. Dallas. I do it in front of my kids too. I like to watch it, but it's fun. Me too. Yeah, they do it too. I got my son. Yeah, my son. Now because we have a to pull in the pools freezing and I've been mountain biking every day so my legs are sore so I go hot, cold, hot, cold and he's doing it.  Oh nice pop. And he could tell you what Pop. I can pick muscles.  I said you get in there dude, you're getting my daughter got up real early today. She set the alarm for eight and I go, why did you get up at eight?  She goes, Because I realized when I get up at ten that I don't get as much done during the day. In the day. Shorter I go, wow, I go, that's very wise. So, you know, kids are Dabb and she's got like a half. She doesn't have Dabb now.  It's just like a new thing. She says something, she goes, I am wise. It's like flexing on like kids can be successful. That's hilarious. She's she's a little beast.  My 11 year old's a beast and it crazy to see that it's crazy. It's weird. She's got all of my attributes, my, like, obsessive attributes. But without any of the I didn't have a good childhood.  Like, that's trouble. It's in a good way. She's super confident. Yeah. She's not like doing it because, like, I want someone to love me. Yes. I want to come from that. Yeah. It's not coming from I want to be she's like, I want to be awesome at everything. And that's when she's going to thrive. And she's always laughing. She laughs at everything. Everything's funny man. She's always laughing. I love it.  Yeah. She's always like like she's she'll say something like nothing better. She thinks things are funny.  Like she's got a very interesting sense of humor.  It's weird seeing kids grow up, you know, with no no fear. You know, like I grew up.  Don't you worry about it, though. Yes. That's the problem, because they're so well taken care of.  I feel like when all of our friends, like almost everyone I know to man that's interesting into a woman has some sort of fucked up, chaotic childhood.  There's some darkness.  Yeah. That's what made them interesting. It's it made them successful in a lot of ways, but I don't know if it's necessary.  I feel like there's valuable lessons that you can get like for you. I think a lot of your lessons you got in sports, right?  Yeah, I think that's I think every kid I really it's all my friends that are fucked up like emotionally that can't deal with loss.  They don't play sports. They never played sports. There's a lot of people that I know that didn't play sports. They don't know how to lose.  And that's such a disadvantage because when you're playing sports, when you're young, it I mean, it's hard times, man. Oh, my God.  And then we get as you get to the higher level, you know, in college, it's you know, it's pretty cutthroat. Man, you learn to deal with heartbreaking issues and pick up your boots and keep going. You also develop a thick skin.  Yes. You got a chip on your shoulder, a chip on your shoulder and a thick skin, the biggest chip on your shoulder.  So important to get through life, though. You need that. You need to understand what competition you need to look at that person like, you know, like sparring. There's always there was always that one.  Do they don't want to spar.  Oh, fuck this guy. I do not want to spar this guy, but you have to and then you have to.  It's going to get better. And then there's this moment where you're lined up and there he is like, oh, boy, time to get my ass kicked.  But also in football, that's when I realized, oh, everybody's not treated the same. And that's that's the real world. Like we're not treated the same. Like I remember the star running back, Bobby Purify. You know, I've always been a huge shoe guy. He would get custom one of one designer cleats and shoes in his locker. And then he'd give me these old ones and he was next to me. I was like, I get it.  Yeah. If you wanna hurt my feelings forever, man, I was like, sweet people get mad at people that are like uber successful.  But those those people like him, like, you know, the Jordans of the world, the people that are just like the fucking car, the guy who's the what.  David Gorgons likes to call uncommon amongst uncommon men. Yes, you know, that's just how life is. And you see that and you realize where the benefits are and being that person. And then you also see the drawbacks.  You see a huge drawback, especially in the personal life. Oh, you're a crazy person. It's tough to manage outside that core, outside that. And it's tough to me.  I mean, talk to Tyson, talk to Tyson about who he was when he was the king of the world. He couldn't manage it.  I mean, no one can maintain that. You talked to John Jones. Talk to John Jones right now.  Right now. Yeah, right now. Yeah. I mean, I guess this is the last the last moment. John Jones, I got sad. That was the first time at all. The John's this recent one. I got sad. I've been disappointed before, but this one I got sad because I watched that video, the arrest video, the arrest video.  That's such a bummer when you watch that video, you know what was a little alarming there when I think it's something to do with this, I know we harp on it, but when he goes, hey, John, I need to do this, this and this year I'm going to warn you, my short term memory is terrible. So it's not because I'm drunk and that even as he's drunk, he was cautious enough to say that, saying, hey, man, my, my, my short term memory shit because I get punched in the head all the time.  Yeah. So that so if you're based off that, we're going to be in trouble. I was like, oh no.  I think that was a little legs were so skinny fucks people up with those getting loud.  They're so well his calves are crazy, his calves are so much smaller than mine and I'm so much smaller than him. It's insane.  It doesn't make. How about will Sarcelles calves. Oh my gosh. Those are the most ridiculous things. Calvin, I spent fifteen minutes.  I will Sarcelles Cassilly Day to Crazy Town has good test two. They're not bad but they're not.  Well SASO seems like you should be able to jump over a building like he should be able to just from a standing position. Just looks like Hulk. It looks like Hulk. We're fucking Cut-Off jeans.  Yeah. Now John Jones. Now imagine like the Tiago Santo's fight, the look at his calf. That's preposterous.  That's when Brian out here you see Brett Brown shaved his head. And that's a trend that he shaved head two days ago.  No, where's the pictures?  I mean, I post on Instagram, so. Yes, I don't go too hard on them.  You should I need to see this. How come I didn't know? Why didn't he send me a picture? That's a good move for him to shave his head.  But he needs to go. He needs to go even more because the top.  Oh yeah. Yeah. Well does he have the hair transplant scar? Yes, he does. He does. That's what I said. I said, do you have the same thing Rogan has. Yeah. But his is small. I guess you need to, you need to shave down more.  Yeah. He needs to go all the way. There he is. Just go all the way.  Yeah. Good, good for him. He probably feels free that way.  It's free now that he look he fucked up the cut himself so it's like all uneven so I could not stop laughing.  We need to just get some tremors. I cut my myself but I fucking go back. But your season. That your season.  Yeah but even the first time I did it you just go all the way down to the bottom, just go to the bottom.  He's, he's got one of them trimmers on it where you leave a little bit of hair. That's what he does. I go to the bottom and then I let it grow like a few days.  I go to the bottom again and just looks a little like Bruce Willis. It doesn't look bad. Does he need to shave it more? You got to see in person it's a little so I could not stop laughing. I could we couldn't get through the show. I could not stop laughing. He's trying to be all serious. I just love laughing.  Well, that's count. Yeah. The best.  He's he's such a fucking character. I don't know a single human like him try to find someone like him.  You know, he's going crazy. And Croner, he gets mad. God, he gets real mad. Was you mad because we're on lockdown. And when's it going to end, man.  When we going back to restaurants, the text message that he sends, he gets very angry. Self fear of self. That's his big anger. He can't go to Vernette or Felix can't hang out with his friends. That plays Felix.  We were supposed to go right before. Well, I went on the fourteenth with count. No, I went with my wife on the fourteenth right before the lockdown.  And we were like, should we go out? We should go out. Let's just go. Let's just do it.  We had reservations, but we had him like five days earlier and started getting as it getting closer and closer.  It seemed like everything was like kind of shutting down, pulling away.  And then it was like a couple of days later that they shut down everything. But you did eat there. Yeah. Yeah. It's good, huh? Fucking fantastic.  That place is awesome. Apparently they and a lot of other restaurants, they have to go. I think Felix is doing Felix to go and so you just don't want to do that.  Yeah. Frickin flappers hit me up because they, they have to that's how they're making money. That's other government. The rent right now they have to sell and they have good food, but they have to do the takeout.  Just keep the doors open. I'm glad people are innovating and they're coming up with ways to stay open. But it would be a real bummer if places like Felix went under or that other place it councillor's view of annatto, that place in Venice, that place is excellent.  Excellent. The thing about those are have high rent. Yes. High ran off Main Street.  Yeah.  I mean they're they're right on Abbot Kinney right there off Main Street. There are Felix off Abbot. Yeah. Yeah. Even higher rent. What the fuck, yeah, that was the most expensive road in California, is it really? Yeah. Why is everybody like that area? Is it the homeless people attracts them?  It's like it's a weird vibe. It's like the poorest of the poor in the richest of the rich.  So it's so strange. We were driving there and we stopped at a red light and there was like this nice house to left, like the super modern looking Venice style house. And right across the street on the right was 20 tents. I know. Camped out. It's such a bummer. Why do they let that happen?  That is the dumbest thing that they let that happen. You know what they do take over the sidewalks.  Don't these bums do to you to get money is if a house goes for sale or rent, these bums squat in front of the house. So the seller, the renter has to come up like you guys got to get out of and they pay us. So they give them money, they leave and then they rent the house. Yeah.  Who should be a sort of hustle service that cleans that up called covid-19?  I don't think it's affecting them. They're already there. I had tuberculosis and fucking the black plague legionnaires disease. They don't give a fuck.  I mean, they were finding what was that crazy medieval disease they were finding in bums and homeless people in Skid Row.  Jesus Christ.  It was a crazy disease that they hadn't found. God damn it.  Do you remember, Jamie, we're talking it's it sounds like the crazy, crazy one, but it's like, oh, typhus, typhus. It's a precursor to typhoid fever. Jesus Christ. They found that.  Look, I don't know what you do. I mean, people are worried about bats. How about people that shit on the street? What kind of I mean, we're talking about diseases that have come out of these Chinese wet markets. There's easily could be diseases that come out of L.A., out of these these homeless encampment. But no one's eaten homeless soup.  Well, I don't know what they're eating. Who knows what they're doing.  But it is not a matter of eating. It's a matter of being around all that thought. That's that's how the how this all got started is. So I don't think it's eating it now, really. I think it's being near them.  They think the patient zero. I believe the theory is the current theory is patient zero. So you can find this was traced to a woman that worked next to the bandstand.  We read it a few weeks ago. Right. That may or may not be the actual patient zero, but yeah, I don't think that could be she's still alive.  I don't think they really, really know what's crazy. They can trace the genetics of this virus. And they're saying that it came from people that came from Europe, that they are in New York City, I should say. I mean, obviously came from China, but the people that got it in New York City got it from people who traveled to New York City from Europe, and most Europeans were in China, went back home and came to New York.  Yeah.  And they think it might have gotten here as early as December and maybe even November. Like they don't even know. I heard November. I think November.  They think they think it got there two weeks at least before the first case. And there's many people that could have gotten it that did not know that they got it and got over it.  And I know it's the cool thing to say right now. Dude, I'm telling you, when I was doing Ontario Improv in end of December, I was the sickest I've ever been and it lasted for 12 to 14 days. I told my brother, you might have taken to the emergency room. After I had done my last show, I was like, we're driving home. Like we might have to go the emergency room.  I felt really fucked, the sickest I've ever been. In what way? And what were you. I had shakes, cold sweats. I was just sick, man. Just coughing. Horrible. Coughing Oh, it was bad.  So the thing is, that could also be a bad flu. Who knows? Yeah. Look, this is one of the things that we in this text thread that you and I are in, we started sharing the numbers of people that have died from the flu is it's stunning salami.  It's stunning. I didn't know. I mean, I knew a lot of people died from the flu, but until you see it on paper, you like what?  Imagine if CNN did a whole marketing thing on how the flu killed everyone every day. And there's this fucking puts all this fear in everybody. If they did every day like they're doing for Cronan, we'd be scared shitless.  True. But there's some preventative measures to have a vaccine.  And then we have flu shots and we also have Tamiflu. There's a bunch of different remedies. We know what the flu is.  Yeah, this is a this is a really dangerous one because it does something to your respiratory system or scars the lining of the respiratory system. It scars people's lungs and there's so much inflammation that they can't get oxygen.  Here's the other issues. They're saying that you probably have it two days before you start showing signs if you show signs at all.  Yes, I'm not at all. Idris Elba apparently never showed any signs. Stanford studies coronavirus early spread in California looks at herd immunity potential. Richard Stanford University trying to determine if the novel coronavirus may have been circulated in California as early as last fall. Your boy had it. And whether it's playing a role in the relative slow spread in the state.  Wow, I hope we do have herd immunity.  Let's get back to the store. Today's herd immunity. Come on.  Joey Diaz called me the other day just to reach out to tell me he loves me, making sure I'm doing the right things. You're doing the right thing, dawg. Yeah. I fucking love you, Brendon Chubb. Great man, but yeah. We're talking about the common story, and I was like, they'll be fine, though, he's like, maybe, yeah, maybe it's a big maybe it's a lot of money to run that place.  Unfortunately, fortunately, for the last six years, they've been making a shitload of money, you know, doing really well.  I think what Peter Shaw's very, very bright man, very, very smart. And I think he's doing the right thing. And I think I think they'll be OK. Look, we could always do a shitload shows when the store comes back and donate all the money. I'm happy to do that.  I'm happy I'd give them rent right now. I'll tell everybody if you didn't see my Instagram, my shows with Dave Chappelle have been moved to September. But when I say it moved to September, I go like this.  You're going to do in September. I saw your post on New York. Right. When is that? November and October 3rd. You're doing it. Hey, dude, it's happening October, I bet. I hope so. I hope so. Come on.  That Foushee guy said people aren't going to shake hands anymore. Do you see that shit? I'm bound everyone from now on bauen like I. I like that just because it's cool like that.  Or you could do it Thai style just now. I'm not Steven Seagal so I'm going to wear beads but not I'm just going to wrap them around my wrist just like this.  Yeah.  There's been a lot of knuckleheads online with this coronavirus talking about healing and positive energy and manifesting now, you know, so much nonsense.  There's a lot of nonsense, not about science. I throw a lot of science out there, but I go off a lot of numbers that I get from way smarter people than me.  Yeah, well, you're what you're doing is you're tweeting actual facts and then throwing a little bro science is the correct.  That's also my current. You're talking about just so many people that are just you know, this is a global transformation and this is our opportunity.  I hope everybody gets better out of this. I hope I hope people recognize that our society is fragile.  Don't you see this is another positive. You see a lot more people working out. Like when I get ready to go on my my bike ride, I see so many more people walking, kids, families, and they have time. That's what it took to get you guys to fucking walk outside.  Well, most people, you know, they they don't I mean, unless you're working from home or, you know, you're if you're in any kind of service industry, your job is gone for now.  So they have time. There's a lot of people whose jobs are shut down.  I don't know what the numbers are, but there's a lot more people at home during the day. A lot of people are home schooling their kids. Yeah, that's it, there's part of me that when Dana came out said he's going to do the UFC, there's part of me that was super proud of them.  Just, you know, I know he was going to get a lot of blowback for it.  And the U.S. is getting a lot of blowback for it. But a partner is like, fuck, yeah, dude, good for you, man, for figuring it out. Good for you. Good for you.  Pretty gangster move. Go to an Indian reservation. Really get in there.  And for international flights up on island, bitches. Wait, what is this company? I bet someone who entered the dragon like what I like. Yeah. Don't worry about it.  I'm, I can tell you it's that I'm not telling anybody. We're just going to you're going to get on a flight flight. We're flying to the island, you and your team. I was like, hey, I can't hate on the guy anymore. I ran in the sand, so sit right on the beach.  So do you remember Bo Dog when Bo Dog had fights on the beach? Yeah, Bo Dog was interesting, man.  People forgot about Blue Dog Phaedrus are there canine started there. Well, it didn't start their feed. Our website, it's not there.  But he did fight on their cane I think. Yeah. He started. They started there. Yeah. Yeah.  It's Masvidal. Forty five Edwards there. That's what stopped him with a head kick. But yeah there were some great fights. Remember Faida did Faida fight Matt Lindland on Bodrog.  Was that Bodrog in Russia or was that affliction.  No, I don't think so.  I think you're right, I think Feyenoord Matlala was Bo dog and and I think Matt Lynam was about to take fade or down and fade or grabbed a rope and it was a big shot and then he knocked them out.  Well, yeah, he slammed them. I think he submitted them.  Here it is Madelin and Faida. Yeah.  So I know he slams Matt Lindland who at the time I'm pretty sure he submitted him. I think he got them in an arm bar. He did. He submitted them but I remember slamming them for.  So go before that though Matt Lewis has always scared me.  He got double under. Yeah he's got them in Arbie there. So Matt Lindley made the got the clinch. I believe he got double under Hooke's. Yep.  And now look he wraps elevating fedora faders grab enough fuckin rope.  Totally grabbed the rope and look, who is that tan Morgiana who's trying to heave Edwards, including even Edwards, you mean?  Well, look, you grabbing the rope and Matalin, let me grab the rope and then use it to. That's what I remember. Peter, dude. Oh, fuck. In Russian, right.  Well, in that moment, that's straight up cheating. I mean, that's how he got top position, Madelin and took him down. Yeah, but in my mind, Lindland is a fucking guy who fought at 170, 41, 185, did he 41, 70, he was so tough, 184, 185, he was so tough, tough as fuck.  But as tough as it gets, you hear the stories about him out of with him.  Hendo Charleson. Oh, yeah. Just the ones who might have fucked her though. It is bullshit. Hey man, that's the problem with robusto.  Right. Right.  Do you remember when there's a couple moments in pride where guys get trapped in the ropes and then submitted somebody got triangle whether head was trapped in the rope and then they got triangle on top.  Zozo nothing worse. When you get knocked out, you fall through the ropes. Oh, my God, it's so embarrassing.  Well, how about Bernard Hopkins last fighter's career when you fought Joe Smith, Joe Smith calls him.  Well, he drops them and Bernard goes through the ropes and hits his head on the ground, which is crazy.  Like, how do you fucking guys not have like, ah, is the apron of a ring for boxing that expensive? Why can you make it bigger?  I can you make it so that a guy doesn't fall or have security where if you see something you know, well they would have to act quickly and be there in time.  And so they have to be around standing on the a distracting.  It would be hugely distracting and it'd be terrible for the people who are watching. But I mean, all you have to do is like, what do you mean what Bellator did, what Beltzer did when they were doing kickboxing and MMR at the same time.  So they have this round ring for Bellator and then they put a square ring in the center of that for kickboxing.  So if you fell to the ropes, you just fell out into the ground area where the Bellator cage would be.  It was perfect. Well, to play devil's advocate, if you're boxing, though, you're like, dude, how many times have people falling off the fucking ring? We know it's been on. Bernard Hopkins died from that.  I mean, he's also seventy years old, fighting 51 or 52, I think. I mean, come on, dude. Crazy fighting this young fucking. Oh, yeah.  Like this dude caught in a triangle inside the ropes. So his leg is wrapped up in the rope and the dude's caught in a triangle.  Crazy. Jesus Christ. Ridiculous. Yeah, it's happened more than once. Two people have been armed, barred that way too.  Did you think you'll see too. Fine. I was going to happen. I didn't know what was going to happen when Kabab couldn't make it. I was like, I bet this is going to be the end of me too. I was like, oh, it's over. But then I saw Kamara Ousman saying, you better get ready to make weight, bitch. I was like, Oh my God. Ousman fights Masvidal. Holy shit, that's worth it.  That's a fight. But then when I heard is Gagin Furguson, I'm like, oh shit.  First team, all violence. I don't know what game she's been doing though. Is he been training like he's training for a fight.  I don't know. They asked him. I saw I think it was Brett Akimoto goes, how prepared are you?  And it took him a while to answer. And then he said something was like, this could be tough. He goes, I have eighteen minutes in me.  He is, you know, all my fights, I don't go decision, I either get knocked down or knock somebody out, he goes, you know, I talk to my family, I cut my coaches and I have 18 minutes of fucking fury. Then it's pretty tough to deal with.  Not a God. It is tough to deal with, but it's the toughest deal with.  But there's anybody that has the endurance to take it to that 18 minutes and keep going. Tony, Tony has the most endurance I've ever seen.  But the only thing that's a little scary when I hear him say that he does throw caution to the wind gauge, he does. And it's tough to deal with because you play the hardest hitter at 55 and Tony gets hit. Man, that's one thing about Tony Blair does like to get hit.  He, I think, actually enjoys it and he welcomes it. What gets you I don't know if he can play that game, especially for 18 minutes.  Well, I don't know if he enjoys it. I just think that he has this pressure. Ford style. He's game for was game.  He's got a hundred percent game for it, but he has such a pressure style that it's inevitable that you get hit. You know, he's not fighting like Wonderboy or something like that. He's not fighting an elusive or Mighty Mouse. He's fighting he's he's trying to break you. I mean, in Tony's fights, there's somewhere around the second or third round where you see the look in these guys faces like motherfucker. I know.  How is he keeping up this pressure since kind of the same way he just goes forward like a little tank keeps going. It's such a good fight.  My favorite fight with Justin Barbosa, because Barbosa is a savage and just inches from over ran him over his fight with poor in his fight with Eddie Alvarez, although he lost both.  But all of a good man.  Oh, they were great. Yeah, his leg was almost done.  Almost done before they pulled it out with the knockout, Poret actually came out on record and said he thinks he's going to win. Really? Yeah. That's because he's never fought, Tony, you know, he's fought and beat them, and it would be great if you beat Tony and then it makes him look good. I don't necessarily know if that's I mean, it's not that Tony can't win. It's not that that Gadge can't win either. It's like, in my opinion is who the fuck knows?  Who the fuck knows, especially in these conditions, like what camp have they had, especially Justin? I know Tony's out of camp, Tony's out of camp.  But you got to everything's everything's not normal. Like you're not getting the same amount of guys.  Yeah, but Tony's not normal, Tony.  Tony, if anyone's going to thrive in a situation. That's Tony. He didn't you know, he didn't spar at all.  Apparently, according to everyone that I've talked to this guy for the Pedes fight after his surgery.  So the guy has knee surgery like a really complex knee surgery where his ligament is reattached to his leg and he has a massive scar.  I mean, he's got a 12 inch scar on the side of his leg. Five months later, he's fighting. Yeah, he's crazy.  That's nuts. That's nuts. And didn't do any sparring. Just just rehabbed everything. Got himself in shape. He looked pretty good.  He looked fucking fantastic. Wobbled in that fight. Of course, he did find Petis Perez is a master striker. Pedes knocked out Wonderboy with the super MANPAD 100 percent. Yeah. I don't know if he can take those same hits the way he.  It's a good question, Gadge. You know, he comes after you, man.  He comes out and he's got a nominal leg kicks, his leg kicks are sensational and he throws leg kicks from crazy angles to like he'll be like right up tight with you, like right here.  And he's chopping at your leg. It's kind of amazing. It's interesting how he does it. Like he's not a he's not he doesn't have a military background, which is really crazy.  Just learn to kick about four years ago. Why more than that?  Because I remember in the values, I'm just saying, like, he's not he has no kickboxing background. He came from University of Northern Colorado to graduate training center Trevor Whittman. All of us came in as a pure wrestler with terrible eyesight. He'd always take his glasses off and squint and it's just this fucking monster. And then he started teaching the late caking like, holy shit, the guy can lick kick, but it's crazy how good he does it.  It's amazing at it. His leg kicks are sensational. Like you would think that he was some moiety champion or something like. That's amazing. Yeah.  Yeah. This is what I want. I want to see Tony shoot for takedown. Hmm. I don't know. I obviously just engaging has phenomenal wrestling. So athletic and was an all-American at northern Colorado. Tony's a stud too. I think this is dog go champ. So lets someone shoot in on the fucking guy.  Well, no one does it. Yeah, no one does it.  Well, what's interesting about gages, you never see him wrestling.  That's what's so crazy. It's like the guy's got this great wrestling pedigree, but he just strikes at everybody and smashes and smashes real strikers like Barbosa. He wants to be violent.  Yeah, that's all violent. It's so nuts, this fight. Actually, not that, you know, obviously I want to be Tony. That's the greatest fight in U.S. history. I think it lightweight.  It's cursed fucking dude. Concussions is five times. Five times.  Five times. What the fuck? I want to see that. That's the fight of the two, the best 155 on the planet.  But Guy Tony, I think will be more entertaining. Are you sick? You're so violent. There's so far, I think these two fucking maniacs, this fight can't be more.  It's impossible.  Don't think I think you're right. I don't think it can be boring. However, I said that about style Bender versus Joe Romero.  I thought you was in a fight. Yeah. I guarantee you Casey Anthony is going to fight.  Well, I'll bet my bottom said that about in Ghana and Derek Lewis. I didn't know Derek Derek Lewis fucking back gave out. You know, Francis had a blown fucking ACL or whatever it was. Did he? Francis upset. He was injured in that fight. Both of them were injured.  I didn't know Francis was injured.  I thought it was just his mind was apparently Balsom had injuries. Oh, I didn't know that, bro. That's a fight this weekend.  No one's coming of that. Knows it's not coming. It should be. It should be. They had Greg Hardy and whoever the fuck he's fighting above that. I'm like, what are you guys doing?  That was because it was on ESPN. The other was on ESPN. Plus, I think the idea was that you're going to have and gonna win Rosen strike, which is just it's like the main event.  That's Disneyland, the end of the night. Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom. That's why it's crazy. Rosen strike. People better not be sleeping on him, man. No, he's a terrifying man. He's a professional kickboxer and he takes a tremendous shot. You look at Overeem didn't do nothing to him. They fought for the entire five rounds.  He didn't do nothing to him until Rosenstrasse caught him with that Rosen strike was going to lose that fight was going to lose that he was going to lose that fight. He was going to lose that fight.  This what's in the prelim still on the sports code main event. Now, I talked to his agent last night.  Oh, this is because the Rosen ominous fight is Paul.  Do they still have Rosen? They're OK. You're right. They kept it there. And Jacaré Souza people are saying that it was Ryan. Yeah, you guys take it back like you guys were, you know, somebody sent me a meme that said Ryan Hall versus John Suzanne, I was like, is that real?  And Eddie goes, can they even do on the weight class? And I thought I was like, they're joking. So I don't respond to it.  I didn't think it was like, look, Ryan Hall has such a hard time finding opponents.  You got to fight the dedi. You got to fight. Put that.  Put a stud. He's fighting a stud.  Is he Ricardo Lamas? OK, that's a good fight for him. That's a that's a fucking fight. Nobody want to fight round Hohmann. Exactly.  Finally gets returned. Yes. Ricardo Lamas in May.  Yeah, he's he's so difficult because Hall is so tall and long.  But also how do you guys think he was flying around? I didn't understand it. I thought maybe he just said, fuck it, I have no camp, but I want to fight. I weigh 185.  I'd watch the shuttle. Imagine it. I mean, I don't think he's losing 40 pounds in between fights, but he's a tall guy. He's like six feet, isn't he?  Yeah, he's not. He's not. Yeah. It's not short for the division. Yeah. He's thin but I mean and he's also he's a ferocious hobby guy.  Right. Rehaul. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he's training at Tristar now. He trains down here now he's Alitalia's his own gym in Orange County and they trained that chemical weapons. Did he ever train with sobby?  Why do I feel like he was with Zahavi? Maybe he did early on, but he's been out of Cali. Interesting. He's old school.  And then Kenis, what is his what's his camp like? Who's putting together the camp? I'm not I don't know who that guy is. Alexander Hernandez comes back.  That's a great fight. I don't know, dude.  I don't think people realize the fucking depth dude fantasy gone over and Rosenstock is insane. It's going to be amazing.  And and if you if you just people environment reboard, that's ridiculous.  People give Francis enough credit. You look at his record like, well, after he had his hiccup against deep and then the dirt loose, I don't count.  But besides deep dude, the run in the dude that he's beat and if he were to become champion, you're talking top five of all time.  Yeah.  You look at his record like, holy shit, if he becomes champion, I mean, knocked out Cain Velasquez knocked out Jades, Alster, Overeem. Yeah. Andre Orlovsky. Yeah.  I mean the whole I mean the who's who and the way he knocks them out that's the thing, it's just the way he knocks them out. But he's getting old. I mean he's, he's getting up there in age. He's like thirty seven now.  I think you know something to think about with Kobe Tony. And these guys say how old is he has to be thirty some.  You know Tony's thirty six is he. And for a light for heavyweight it doesn't matter for lightweight. That's long in the tooth.  It's not going to say it there that they had that information. But let me see the main card. What's the main card. The card. So filthy took that one off.  Jeremy Stephens, Calvin Katara down here in the bottom. What, down on the bottom of the screen, if you can see that, OK.  Oh, that's the Jeremy Stephens Calvin Carter's fantastic fight, dude.  How about fucking your boys on their nickel price?  So, OK, it still says Greg Hardy is the Komin, but that's been changed, right? That's from what I understand right now. From what I understand, he's the co main event, Jeremy and Calvin Carter.  That's a sleeper of the night. I think Calvin Carter is the dark horse of the 145 pound division. That motherfucker scary.  He's a beast. I mean, he is had I think he's had two losses inside the octagon.  Thank God that the fucking fight Senator McConnell beat him with leg kicks.  He made a real good adjustment and started catching him with leg kicks and won a decision. And then he beat a bunch guys and lost his beat.  And he lost as a beat in a fight where he was he was dominating third round that he was up dominating that third round. And I was like, man, if this is a five round fight, I, like, cater to all the he fucked up llamas.  That was a fight where right away you could see the difference in the hands. Calvin trains a lot with boxers. He's got vicious hands, like super accurate and really long.  Like if you see if you go to his Instagram, he put up the scale of Lomis.  It's very interesting because he ranges him, he ranges him, and then he drops these super long punches on.  He's a Boston kid, right?  Yeah, the but it's the like watch how he sets this up like he moves his hands, want to see the range boom, the length of that.  And he's huge for a 45 or two, real tall and long. But the fuckin talk in that right hand, he spins them around with the left and then puts the lights out with the right. Look at that is fucking picture perfect, man. Picture perfect. Oh, shit. Irish Micky Ward says good luck, Calvin. Wow. How about seeing that looking down six six comes Simpson.  Yeah, but that's got one.  Two is sensational to him for Stephens is a phenomenal, phenomenal, phenomenal look at all the fights. It's like man five the night. Good luck. I know. Retail price. I know. Okay.  I know Vicenta Lukasz and Animal and Nico price prices an animal.  Both those guys together. That's if I can believe that. Go back to what you just had there, Jimmy.  The whole falafel cart. I couldn't there it is. Hmm, I cannot believe when the U.S. announces some people hated on it like you fucking negative bitch is just how it is.  It's insane. That's just really cruel at times. And Dana pulled this off.  This if this were on a timer all the times, dude, if this was a regular pay per view, would make my day card, let alone with Korona.  This is amazing. The Greg Hardy DeCastro. Listen, not hot, not a highly skilled fight song. He's going to fucking sleep, hopefully, but to become an event is a little crazy.  Well, I was interested that Greg Hardy stepped up and fought Volcom and didn't look bad and didn't look bad and get annihilated, didn't get annihilated against one of the best heavyweights in division. Correct.  Alexander is a really technical fighter and real long, real tall, long.  I mean, look at what he did to Fabrício over doing. Fabrício Verdian was UFC heavyweight champion. He fucked him up and Greg Hardy went the distance with him and did not look back and had one hand. Yeah. And yeah. Broke his hand early in the fight. He's going to get better. He's a stud athlete. The difference between like guys like first of all, he doesn't have another way. Right. He doesn't have a fucking football career anymore.  He's not going to play pro bass.  This is it. This is it. There's no podcast's. There's nothing to this.  Then he's got a dicey past in terms of the law and would say the diciest.  It's pretty dicey. And John Jones says, hold my beer and hold my tequila. But but Greg Hardy's a fuckin elite athlete.  He's a guy who knows how to be a professional athlete. And he was all produ yeah, he's a legit superstud superstar.  But there's a thing about guys like that where from the time they're young, they realize this insane work ethic is how you make it. And they also they're used to these regimented programs.  Right.  Where a lot of football players and you can speak on this, they're used to these programs where everybody's doing the same kind of work versus boxers or MMA fighter on your own.  You're on your own. And sometimes you have acid and sometimes you're not disciplined. Do you fuck off. You don't go to kickboxing. You decide, I don't want to go to jujitsu today. I want to fuck my girlfriend.  That kind of shit doesn't happen in football, doesn't work that way, especially at like University, Colorado, Ohio State. So if you're one of ten linebackers and you're all doing the exact same thing, you're all fighting for your job every day. If you, for whatever reason, don't do something well. And this guy does, he's probably going to play over you.  So you're like, is this heightened frickin competition all the time in? And it brings the best out of you. It does.  Eric Sanders was a football player, too, right? Yeah, not Alabama.  STOD go watch his fight with Khelil round. Oh he looked at me and the motherfucker doesn't flinch. Khelil Roundtree was lighting him up, lighting him up. He never flinched.  Kallu Roundtree was fucking his legs up in a way very rarely you see, because I was so fucked up and he Khaleel was full morti light on the front legs whack whack.  Oh dude.  When Carlile's on his game he he displays some of the best morti you're going to see in the UFC that Eric Andrews just.  I know you don't watch football Joe. So he played in Alabama and it was on the national champion team. So that's like creme de la creme doesn't get better than that.  Let's like wrestling at Ohio State or Oklahoma, like he's high level football player.  Well, he's a stud. The guy is an animal in terms of like in his ability to endure pain and is his ability to press forward and, you know, and fights a lot. Takes fights to fight a light heavyweight, take a fight. One eighty five, his game, he's game as fuck. And again, that's the thing that's like these elite athletes, these guys who know what it takes to be a winner. You know, if those Greg Hardy guys, Eric Andrews guys, and we're going to get more of those, there's going to be more guys like that.  Let's see a path. And there's there's more guys like that that don't want to rely on a team. You know, they don't want like if the team they're on sucks, they don't shine. They'd rather kill what they 100 percent.  You know, I mean, there's a lot of guys like that where they'd rather just go out and do it themselves. And May is a sport where they can do that. Yeah. So you see these guys, they start practicing in mid-May, you know, off season, they train a little bit off season. I wouldn't be surprised if John's brother Arthur gets an MMR, both of them.  I mean, Chandler's all pro to pro bowler, but Arthur trains with him a lot of time.  Yeah, he's huge.  He's such a big boy, chubby, and he can fight, man, if he decided to start fighting, take on a few pro fights. I mean, I think John said in interviews, but I remember when John and I were talking, he I mean, Arthur gives him problems. Oh, yeah.  Like if they wrestle, it's probably huge an explosive. He's and he's huge and the nicest guy. The nicest guy. But he's so big. You don't have problems though, huh.  You don't really hear much about the brothers fucking up. Well, they both been pop for steroids. Yeah.  I mean about sports though. I'm talking about like hanging out at Albuquerque at four in the morning. You. I could shoot guns out of. Yeah, well, they don't. Well, they do get hit in the head. They get it in the head football style, which by the way, I got through the Wanderers series on. I still haven't watched the Netflix documentary on your boy.  That looks exactly like my shit out so much like so much is hilarious. But God damn do that. Wandera podcast series warriors sound good. So good.  I was gripped. It was one of those you know, sometimes you get a podcast series like that, like another one is the drop out about that Elizabeth Holmes chick that robbed everybody with that Tharon. Oh, that's right. Yeah, that's another one. Is it good. Holy shit. Is it a good one? There's a few of those. We start.  I mean, you like, what the fuck, dude? Sometimes I'll sit my car and wait till episode's done. It's like so into it.  I'm on something right now that I know you read that chaos book, the Charles Manson book that he's coming in.  Who Tom O'Neil is coming in next week. Yes, I'm in the middle of that book right now.  It's called Holy Shit, Holy Shit. You look at me, it's a little different.  You look at the whole thing a little different. Yes. You're like, what? Yeah, I don't want to say too much because I want Tom to explain when you have him on next week. That book's so fucking good, dude.  I'm balls deep and I'm in rant and rave about that book grip.  Well, the things that are absolutely provable that he knows Charles Manson, the CIA in the secret history of the sixties, the things that are absolutely 100 percent provable, just those things are mind blower's.  We are like, whoa.  And it's documented how the CIA and the House and in Haight Ashbury in San Francisco and yeah, how he was doing wild shit in the CIA would let him go. Yeah. How he was out here at that ranch and the cops never the people don't do what he's doing. Wild shit. Arrest them. Now we're told not to touch them. Like what. Yeah.  Did fuck they kill the caretaker that rantanen find that guy's body until the late 70s. Yeah.  They they did a lot of my favorite books. It's a very good book. They did a lot of shit in the 1970s with drugs and people for experiments in the 60s and the 70s. And that's how they created the Unabomber man. Ted Kaczynski was a part of the Harvard LSD program.  Yeah. What did you watch that documentary? The Net? Is that the one you saw? It's on Netflix. Which one is it? I forget, but it's about the Unabomber. And I didn't know that. I'm like, why is he such why was he so fucked up?  Manhunter I think so, yes. I haven't watched that. It's so good. There's another one. The other one called.  Oh, that's the Unabomber in his own words.  The first time he only let one person ever interview him. And it's all the tapes from the interview.  Oh, and you know, his, his, his defense team goes, listen, dude, you're not going to get the death penalty if you just plead insanity because I'm insane. He was. Do I seem insane to you? He goes, I'm not insane. And so he fired his defense team because they wanted to say he was insane. He goes, I'd rather die than be called insane.  So I'm not insane. I'm a genius. Dude, he was smart as fuck.  Well, he might be too smart because he's actually look, he's not correct to kill those people, but he is correct that technology is eventually going to overcome people. Now, imagine this. This is we're going deep down the Eddie Bravo rabbit hole. I love. Imagine if you were.  Artificial intelligence, and you had decided you wanted to assimilate with people, but you had to convince people one of the best ways to convince people is to get them addicted to technology, check done everybody's DNA technology and then get them connected through social media apps, get them connected to technology.  I mean, how many times you go to a restaurant? Well, not right now. Not at all. But anytime you go out in public before the quarantine, everybody was on their phone in jeopardy.  Now you throw a virus in there. So now they can't be with people and then you make it. So when they see people that can't touch them, they can't hug people, they can't shake hands, they have to make distance. So now the only way to connect with people is through zoom or face time or knowledge technology.  And then and then while we're all quarantined, you're installing 5G towers.  Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What do you see that?  Did you post guess that little devil devil. Yeah. Tell me. Tell me.  Because you don't need the five thousand five countries have 5G towers. More than 100 countries have coronaviruses. Fucking idiots.  It's not the best point. The best point is one of those points where you go, oh yeah, I saw Tyree's posted.  He's like, you. Y'all need to look at this 5G. That's what's causing all this and killing kids and coronaviruses like, oh, buddy, oh buddy. This Fast and Furious 19, shut the fuck up.  They probably don't want them on.  There's so many fucking people that think of 5G is what's killing people. But it's like there's always going to be that thing where whenever something happens, people look for some nefarious backwoods sort of fucking icer.  I also think, you know, in this time, it's very easy to get down and depressed and a lot of people thrive in that. So they want it to be bad. They can't get out of here, too. You're right. Get out of here.  You're right. You're right. There are people that are like they're happy to thrive. Ah, yeah. Thriving.  I saw some lady write some posts about Justin Bieber just making fun of Justin Bieber's house, which, by the way, looks pretty pimp.  They're like a dope. Yeah, I know. They're like it's so disgusting. It looks like it looks like a stupid SIM City house.  But then she wrote Eat the Rich. And Mike, but Mike, he's a singer, meanwhile, she meanwhile she looks like an armadillo. Yeah, yeah. I'm going to eat, you bitch.  Take your shirt off, throw an armadillo on the Barbie shell. People are so crazy, though, like because they're angry and they're frustrated.  It's like, is it his fault that he's a super successful musician that has a crazy Dobos and super talented and also that house, your house bitch.  Yeah. Let me look at the middle of a house.  That's what she's angry. That's what she's like. Yes. The rich doesn't have it. I saw one guy post this thing in town. Talk to us. He goes, hey, I've heard horrible stories about Alan. For every bad story you guys share, I'll donate two dollars to this. You know, I'm like, dude, what's wrong with you, man? Do something positive. You think this is positive? Hey, fucking Alan.  People are cooped up and they're filled with anger and they find a target for that anger. They're filled with anxiety and depression and rage and, you know, so do something to get to be creative, man.  Do something to get out of it, you know. Good call. Yeah, but don't hate on the people who are doing it. And that's why you're in that position.  Do you see what Alan did? This is really, really kind of funny. She said being stuck here in quarantine is like being in prison. I haven't changed my clothes in days and everyone's gay.  It's funny. It's funny. It's funny. And she got attacked. Do you think this is prison? My grandmother died. You're living in a mansion, that kind of shit.  But I think it's probably partly because that guy came out and said, hey, Ellins mean, post your stories about Ellen being mean.  You see the stories. They were nothing, nothing to back then. What was it? It was like? Oh, I came on a show and before I left she didn't say hi.  It's like Ellen takes down video after jail. Joke about coronavirus, of course, aliens. Wow. She's she's shook. Shook right.  Now, go to your future comic. Stand by it.  Well, there are several other articles written about her being an asshole. All about that. Yeah. Because people capital. I've heard about it. I've heard, you know, entertainment's all around.  It's like don't you also think that she's one of those tooth and claw get to the top. That's why she became Ellen in first place. And that makes a lot of enemies.  She's a type. She's not a personality. It's her show.  It's her way or the highway it runs for people run also probably maligned most of her life because she was a lesbian, had to keep it in tight, some darkness, some darkness. And there are some anger in there, you know.  Oh, but the fucking jokes.  Hilarious. Hilarious. It's a great joke. Hilarious joke. Great joke. I like that.  Wearing the same clothes and everyone's gay. That's funny. That's funny.  Really like, fuck, yeah, fuck you eat the rich, got the rich. Hey man, Justin, have you seen that fucking crib? You know what that looks like inside, you fucking morons next to that crib is.  Yeah, but the thing is, like, it's saying it's the ugliest house ever.  It's so crazy. It's weird looking. Yeah. But when you're Justin Bieber, look at that, bro. That looks like some sort of you know what it looks like. It looks like a museum.  Like you would go there and they'd be like a dinosaur in there. Looks like it looks like the opening Jurassic Park.  Yes, I think it is. Yeah. That's a dope house.  I bet it's all glass. You just walk around butt naked with his girl and it looks like a giant salad spinner. Now you can lease it. Well, no one's got Monalisa now. Social media users mock this Beverly Hills house, but tweeter's got a few things wrong.  First of all, let me see your house. You're mocking this. Push your house, post your house, bitch posters.  Shitty little apartment in Studio City to in this castle from this fucking Tony Stark Castle, 60 grand a month. Oh, that's it.  Do that thing is fucking look inside. Look at the inside. That house is dope is fine. Makes me like a more.  Yeah. You know, when I heard Justin Bieber songs I thought it was sung by a girl. At first you didn't. I had no idea. I thought it was a girls song. It's almost like that's Justin Bieber.  I'm like what. Like the yummy. It's like I do. Why are you laughing. I didn't know.  No bro. I listen to ninety eight percent classic rock. OK, yeah, I'm that old dude.  But you put your kids or listen to Justin Bieber. I don't know if they do. No, not around me bro. Shut that shit off.  I throw it in and get the shit out of some little scanners. What.  Yeah. If they work out at the gym I make them listen to fucking Skinner and Zeppelin but I'm sure they have the stuff they like. Yes.  Yeah. Oh my God. It's terrible. Yeah. I just to listen to my kids sing along. Yeah. Yeah, what if Lizzo scared of Korona, she should be. That's all I'm saying. Not to say she should be.  A lot of people should be scared.  You know, my dad hasn't left his house, but he's also like 63. So I'm like, I get it, Poppa. Yeah.  My parents got really spooked. My parents got real spooked. They don't they don't do shit. They're holding up.  I think that when the remedy comes out, hopefully when they figure out what it is, we're all going to relax.  When we found she was saying that we're not shaking hands anymore, ever.  No shaking hands again, ever like, you know, come on, bro, I can't. Come on, man.  Do come on. That's why I kind of like that the U.S. is doing their thing. And also it's like this is the you see the Dana White and fritted is like they're cowboys, man.  They take risk their cage fighting promoters. There's no safety in that. Do you think that when Frances and Gano fought Alster over him and knocked him into another dimension, do you think there's any safety in that?  Know where's the safety? But al-Saad rather have Korona.  They need that uppercut. I'm saying it's like that also. I mean, Tony's the oldest guy in the car at thirty six. Yeah, we'll get the that if if Tony let's say worst case scenario, all the fighters got kronur look at the odds, they're all going to be just fine sweats in the shape that they're in. Odds are going to be fine.  And Tony Ferguson gets Korona. You'll see him the next day running.  Hells yes. With a mask on so other people don't give a fuck. Now, as long as those fighters don't go back home and the grandparents are around, that's where it gets dicey. But that's where I'm assuming they're not fucking idiots. Yeah, that's where it gets dicey.  I just wish there was a way to tell if you had it, because so many people are asymptomatic. You know, there's a lot of people that didn't feel any symptoms at all and they found that they had it and like, whoa.  You know, I wish there was a better way to know if you had it, but but even if there's not, again, you look at the odds, the chances are in this way and the guys are going on with the fight. It's like everyone should be fine.  Yes. covid-19 tests expected for fighters, coaches prior to UFC 249. So they're going to test them. And I think what they're doing at the event is going to they're going a temperature test, everybody.  Temperature testing. Again, to play devil's advocate, a little tough because, again, some people have and don't show symptoms to show symptoms at all.  Expect to send test kits to fighters in the teams ahead of the event, which is currently rumored to take place at Tichy Tocci Tocci Powles casinos in Lemoore, California. A second round of testing is also expected to take place on site at two four nine. Testing is one of strongs measures the promotion could take to ensure that those who attend the event are negative for the coronavirus, which is an incubation period of up to 14 days, which doesn't completely eliminate the possibility of spreading the virus, according to the CDC.  It's possible a person in the early stages of infection could test negative on the test recognized by the Public Health Institute.  Oh, great. I got an update on Frances. So, yeah, they're still finalizing the lineup, but they believe Frances will be coming of that.  It has to be. Why would you not? Why would you not? But who do they have the main event on ESPN? That's the that's the fucking sweetener. That's a little taste of meth that gets you to buy the paper for you.  I know. Who would you let me see the cardigan.  How about Stephens and Carter? When is that? Is it on the main cards? Minka It should be on the main card. That's my fight. Luchini Nico price.  That's a great fight to the whole fucking car dude. Yeah. I just. I wish I was free though. Hmm. Nothing.  No. Not to make that they're going to make that cheddar William WME. You know you got to think all the touring acts musicians me.  OK, I'm WME, big deal falder all their touring acts. Everything's been canceled out for twenty. He's been moved to October four twenty and Vancouver is moved to October twenty fourth, October 24th.  That's going to be in high October 24th. We're going to get high as fuck in Vancouver, hopefully.  Hopefully covid too doesn't come out. So that's, that's the main card. And go to the, the prelims and see who's going to be the.  If it's not. You're right here I was John Kerry. That's it right there. Just move that one up. And then the bottom is Marlon Vera and reboard. Now go to fight pass prelims. So what they'll do is they'll move up Michael Johnson and comma worthy. They'll do do. That's a great game, by the way. Yeah, those are great too. The move that ESPN do. You know, I heard I heard the fight is going to be fine.  I heard the commentator is going to be in super danger of getting Korona. So you should do it. And we should do if I come back, I selfishly don't want you to do it.  And also I don't want to do it, too.  But I also I'm very curious about what it's like to see a fight in an arena with no one.  There have ever been the ultimate fighter. No, I mean, granted within the arena. But no, it's just it just feels it just feels different.  Yeah, I'm sure you can really hear that, like, oh, god, I know it's going to it's going to sound really weird because I scream a lot too.  I'm oh, I'm going to be like everyone's going to hit. Yeah, it's going to be very strange.  You're going to hear what I think should be done. They're going to hear that might help. Yeah. For DC, if DC is going to be there with me if someone's wrestling. So you think you're going to do it. Oh no. I'm thinking a lot. You still don't know what to expect Saturday. I have to decide.  Oh well, Olsen, I said that I would do it if I was going to be in America. I talked it in. I said, look, man, you got to do it in America. I'm going to do it. But it's not really in America. It's on an Indian reservation, which means it's not sanctioned by any athletic commission.  So does it not count? It counts. What's that will be sanctioned event? Yeah. How? It says that all of their international events, they work together with the Nevada commission to sanction them and the ABC, which is the Association of Boxing Commissions, who about sports?  This will be a section of it.  Oh, wow. All pulled out, all the stops. Oh, well, how have imposed sanctions on.  That's interesting. So how do they skirt the California rules for combat sports?  Because it's not the technically not on the nanny jurisdiction. Right.  So they're using the go back scroll back up again, please scroll back to the beginning of the article.  Here's something to think about.  If any substance in a boxing commission in combat of sports. So the ABC, which is the Association of Boxing, come out of Sports, released a statement saying that it's taking place on tribal land.  How great is tribal land? I can do anything. I can do whatever they want. Fantastic. I mean, just during these times, they had a rough reason for why the roughest I mean, they used to own the whole country. When the UFC does international events, they regulate themselves using Nevada State Athletic Commission inspectors in this event on sovereign land is no different. Fantastic sovereign land.  We have little countries inside our country. Fantastic. Here's what's interesting.  Is any other like if Bellator world PFL, if they were like, fuck California Commission, we're going to do our Native American land in California, they would never be allowed to work here again. That that athletic commission like, dude, you fucked up, you're not doing it. But the you see such a juggernaut. I don't think California is going to flex on them. And the U.S. has a close relationship with California.  Well, California Athletic Commissions run by Andy Foster. I'm a big fan of that. I like Indy. He's the best with the whole Jon Jones stuff.  Remember all that. So he has a pretty tight relationship with the UFC and Dana White. So I don't think it would be an issue for them.  Well, I don't think so either.  It's being sanctioned not by the California Athletic Commission, though. Yeah, but ABC commissioned. Good enough. Here's here's what else is kind of instrument. This is. It's Great Dane has put it on, he made it happen, but you realize that one of the reasons they're making it happen is there's a little bit of desperation because they have to put on 40 something fights.  How many how many do I say, Jimmy, I read this article forward to four years. If they have to, they have to put on 42 to to get their 750 million bucks from ESPN. They have to do that. How many weeks are left in the year? Thirty eight.  We get a ton of fights on weight and you've got to put on. So how many have they done. They've done seven. Seven thirty five to go.  Thirty eight weeks if you have a fight every week back to back to back and then they're going to go to Fuck Island. Right. Great. Are they read to Jeffrey Epstein's island. Is that true Jamie. That's the rumors online.  That's so awesome. He actually did. Yeah.  Can we would treat events held on Mystery Islands the same way as well. Mystery Islands. We are in a god damn movie.  So the U.S., you can sense and you know, there's something you don't know. There's a little bit of desperation where they have to put on the fight to get that 750 million bucks. The street goes, fuck you pay me. Desperation is a word that you could use.  Another word is innovation. They had to innovate. They had to figure out how to keep having fights. You know, they it's desperate because, you know, they need to do something.  WME needs the money. Everybody needs the money.  I mean, the UFC is one of the rare people that WME owns. That's not fucked right now in terms of like fire and employees. And there was an article written that the UFC fired a bunch of employees. It's not true. So true.  William Morris, let go some of the agents employees. But you see, didn't I say that's more than it did to Dana than me?  Yeah. Yeah.  I think it's both innovation and desperation. Like, do we have to get this money? Yeah, we have to get this money. We're going to figure out how to make these fights happen.  Well, they canceled three cards, right? Postponed. Postponed three cards. They just jam those motherfuckers on fuck island to fuck island, the Friday island.  They know no one knows where the island is, though, right now. Don't tell anyone.  It's it's in international waters. Right. That's the idea. Yeah.  And then all the international fighters going to fight there.  That's so strange because it's fighting. Henry Cejudo, the real kings already told you that we're fighting May 9th.  See their piece. I'll bring bring your other tiny little friend. Oh, God, I can slap people around. They said that a lot of Brazilian fighters couldn't get visas for the UFC 250.  Oh, is that why all those nofollow couldn't get visas to leave Brazil? Because Brazil doesn't want people leaving. So the idea but also to be fair, Dominic Cruz versus Henry, Sudan is a better fight.  It's a very good oh, no, I don't know about that. All those coming off a loss bullshit's a loss.  Really? I thought. Jamie Yep. That's fine. Fine, that's fine. I don't know about a loss. Well, what's the show, though? It does show it on the record, but I thought that was a bad decision.  Horrible decision, but it's tough to give him that nod. Not not if you're the UFC. You fuck those judges. No, I get it. It's the Wild West. Yeah. We're fighting on fuck ilin guy that lost the Fisking, the title shot. We got to Interm Belt. It's like one of the belts are hilarious. But Tony, a two time interm belt champion, they better take it from them this time.  They stole it from before. Yeah they did. I mean, it's on the longest winning streak in U.S. history.  I think you know what's going to happen, isn't he? Yeah, he is in like. Yeah, period. Longson lightweight, right? Yeah. Well I think period though. Right. Well if you go on his record. Yeah.  And in terms of like years I mean he hasn't lost since he got his arm broken the Michael Johnson fight.  Here's something else to think about. Tony Ferguson, just in case you can be a complete violent. Tony's probably going to fight for a little while. Khabab has Ramadan in August, so I'm assuming we're going to be back to normal. Kobe's going to want to fight before then. Tony is not going to be ready unless he smokes. Just engage with no one smokes, just engage. So you're going to get koner could be two in between that in July.  Yes, we're in we're in March. Yeah. April, April. But I'm thinking May, June, July, August. And Tony could still fight in July.  Economist Thomas Connors chomping at the bit to go ising. Yeah, yeah, but Kebede doesn't want to Icona. The thing is, it's the UFC that he went through with kind of talking shit to Conor's already talking shit, he's already talking shit again, like it's not like he's going to stop talking shit. He's going to wrap it back up again. So Kobe must endure all that stuff again until he can get a hold of them one more time.  That's why I think they're going to do. I have no doubt you think Connor's to be one more person other than cowboy. You think again, it's it's it's kind of McGregor, he's the biggest, most famous fighter of all time. Would you not watch could be pandered to? Oh, I'd watch it for sure.  Especially if it takes place on Fox Island. Dun dun dun, Whyatt supposedly deleted. Oh, yeah, I saw that Anderson's front kick, Ronda's on backhanders crackups high kick John side kick the knees over and over again. It's actually the only thing at this stage, KBB, Little Mermaid leg wrapped thing that he does.  Why did he delete that? I don't know. He said way worse. Oh, now he's gonna. You because you think you can a little bit of a layoff.  Oh, yeah, so so then, you know, because you're doing this fight, which is the fight guys were getting, but Ramadans and I guess so we could be fighting between there maybe or he just fights it out, rides it out, fights in the December 31st card.  God wants fights when he knows that there's going to be fights, they'll do it in Vegas. They'll do a T-Mobile big deal. Ba ba boom. Fireworks. He didn't fight for money. He doesn't give a shit.  He's probably got so much money right now. And he's in Russia and they like worship money. He drives a Toyota. That's a bummer. You know that which to which Toyota. The island of Emerald. Isle of the Islands, Emerald. Isle of Ireland.  That's not true. Silly, silly koner.  He drives a fucking like a Toyota Tundra. Those are cool. They're fine. But I mean, that's him.  The guy's a multi multimillionaire and doesn't fly 10 times over. At least you're looking at me where it's like sweat suits and shit doesn't have a fancy watch, doesn't know fancy bosses.  Nothing, nothing when he does with his money, puts in a nice grizzly bears and shit.  He's a total polar opposite of Connor in that regard. That's why it's fantastic. Yeah. Conor's wearing a half a million dollar watches while he's hitting the speed. I love to see that shit. Yeah, I love it. He's in the cobra bag with a fucking half a million dollar watch.  That's great. You need that. You know how much I watch cost, but it looks expensive because.  Because you got Tony who's labelled as the crazy guy, right. Yet Tony who's labelled. Well, he's just he's he's a different bird.  Let's see, when Tony had sunglasses on his staring down, what could be when he's telling. Could be. Take your glasses off. Yes.  So take your sunglasses off, take your sunglasses off and keep your eyes like what it's like if you realize this guy guy's out there. He's he's a he's a brilliant, mad man, just like Tony. A good deal with this guy. You deal with Connaughton money, my weightlifting gloves and he's got sleeves rolled up six days.  I'll tell you, if Johnson were able to pull this off, just engage, he could be a fuckin fight. Oh, my God. Because Jesse can wrestle. Yes.  Yeah. Phenomenal, phenomenal fighter.  He can wrestle and he's super dangerous standing up. And it's really hard to take him down if he doesn't want to get taken down. It's a real hard go and he throws everything into those punches.  And he's he's wild but calculated, you know.  Yeah. Yeah, he he came on food truck tire and we actually got into it. And I loved when guys address stuff because, you know, I'm not engaged for a long, long time. And I always said he's pretty. He just knows caution to the wind and goes fucking and he just balls. He's like, Dude, you keep saying that, man. People keep telling me that. He's like, it's calculated.  You've got to go back and watch the tape, like, got mad. That's interesting. Yeah, he's he goes, I know exactly what I'm doing. Like, all right, I'm telling you.  Well he does know what he's doing, but it is very risky.  It's both. I think he's calculated in that he's he's realizing there's a high risk, high reward thing. So he calculates that that's worth it.  Whereas a lot of people calculate now, I'm not doing that. I'm not fighting that way. He's his style of fighting.  You know, that's not a long career. He's not going to know.  And that's one of the reasons I think he took this fight.  And, you know, like Chuck Liddell, perfect example, real similar style in a lot of ways. Rock and roll.  Just fucking throw caution to the wind and let the hammers fly. I mean, that style doesn't get you. I mean, we all see how Chuck went at the end. The end couldn't take a shot at him.  You can't do it this day and age. And you see, guys are too good. Yeah, guys are way too good. Can you like Starbound or one of Beat Your Romero if he threw caution to the wind, you got knocked the fuck out.  Right. Right. And you guys are two talented guys are two talented these days. Yeah I think so too I think.  But but the way Justin does is not totally caution to the wind. Just takes risks, a lot of risk.  But with it you get the rewards like the Edson Barbosa Knokke. I mean he got in Barbosa face.  He, he broke Barbosa smashed him James vich to smash the way he does it, the guys too.  But but then think about the highest level guys that he's fought. You look at disempowering. You look at his fight with Eddie Alvarez. He lost.  What is his full record like? Who is his best win dance running? Ayton Barbosa. Hmm. And then the time he fought, you know who I think the top three top four guy doesn't play. He lost Eddie Alvarez at the time. Monster right. He lost.  Yeah. And then the World Series of fighting stuff.  It's just not the Taj. Yeah it's hard but I feel like yeah. Those two fights in a row that he lost. But I feel like when you look at his his style in the Vic and Barbosa fights and the sironi, I think he's gotten better.  I don't think you're beating those top boys like you ain't been Kebede fighting like that. I don't think.  Oh knows man. I mean, we don't know. I don't know. But I would say the odds are in my favor. When I say that interest now can can just beat anybody in the world. Yes, but the odds are with that fighting style going against Kabab or Tony, for that matter. It's tough, man, but you got to give him an advantage.  Striking versus oh, hits harder than all of them, right? 100 percent. But then we're not going to be like he wants to take him down.  Right. Do you think he's going to be able to take him down easily? Easily. Yeah.  You know, talking to some guys I know it could be would go against, you know, like Penn State, like Ed Ruth, one of her four time all-American, I think three time national champion is like a fucking statue at Penn State. And I wrestled with him. And it does not go well for him, for Redruth.  Really, really.  I know guys come and get fuckin Malda bkb world class wrestlers way heavier than fuck them up. Real guys. We know that. Good that. Good God damn.  Talked to D.C. about it. Oh, yeah, I have, I have, but I want to hear from you. Yeah, he's such a monster. Yeah. When you hear someone like Josh Thompson and hear these guys tell the stories about to be like, I don't know if I'll ever lose, he's that good. And we've never seen loser around practice.  Well, he lost one round ever in a fight, and that was around three against Connor, where it looked like he was kind of taking the round off. Yeah.  You know, but I mean, that's what guys do when they want a final push to finish a guy and then you end up finishing them the next round.  I think that rematch, again, can kind of beat them. I don't know. But I think if Connor's focus has a full camp, I think that fight does go a little different. I do give kind of a better chance.  Hmm. Interesting. Yeah, I don't know. I mean, you never know. Who knows. It's fun. It's it's the funnest. Yeah, it is the best. There's no basketball. Basketball can't perform right now.  Well the thing about the difference in basketball and everything else and may is you never made there's two guys that fighting and then there's one referee.  Those are the ones in contact with each other with basketballs.  Everyone's talking on top of everybody. And five, the bats are not shooting in each other's faces and football, same thing colliding with a football mean. They're not going to miss a beat. You don't think so?  Well, didn't didn't Gavin, our governor, say something about football not coming back?  He doesn't count when he talked to he didn't count. When you talk to like Trump in some of these other people talk like Trump told the NFL, the commissioners, like I'm planning for an NFL season, not skip a beat. Do you want to see people piss in America?  Fuck with football, fuck with LSU football or Georgia football, college football. See what happens. You think things are bad now? Fuck with the college football.  You know, this is a weird time, too, because right before the election, you know, election comes in November. Like, imagine if this had this shit was going on right now and the election is like next week.  God is chaos. Your boy Bernie dropped out here. Throughout Biedermann beating Trump no, that's your best, that's the guy.  It shows you how crazy the system is that they wanted him, that they wanted Biden to be their guy, that they don't they can't admit that he's in cognitive decline. I mean, it's very strange.  Listen, I fuck up all the time. I speak for a living. I fuck up all the time because I didn't. But I do know you fucked up, man, your politician.  I fucked up all the time, too. But we're also talking live for hours and hours and hours at a time. If I had a prepared thing that I was doing like my standup, I don't fuck up, then you would be sharp as fuck.  If you are having one of those conversations, they're asking you, look, if someone wants to ask me questions about things that I understand, like May or like comedy, like if you want to ask me questions about things that I think about and talk about all the time, you have your black belt in black.  Yeah, I can talk to you and really clearly about those things and make a lot of sense. He can't do that about politics and he's been a politician forever.  And that's a shit. He's he's an you know, he's a guy who's suffering is in decline. And they're going to try to Wilmont and whoever his VP is, whether it's Kamala Harris or Michelle Obama, maybe whoever it is, but that's who you're voting for.  You know, he's I mean, it's sort of like when Dick Cheney was basically running the country. Yeah. George Bush was the president. Yeah.  You know, I don't know. We'll see. There's no way beats Trump. He doesn't beat Trump. Not a chance. No, not a chance.  Especially because of the timing of this. Right now, we're in the shit, right? We're in the April shit is the worst time of the Korona. A lot of people are dying. There's a slight drop off in New York. People dying less today than yesterday. A slight drop off yesterday from the day before. So things are looking pretty good. California, it's going to be. Yeah, California is looking very good right now. We're crushin at some point is looking very good.  So and then we're set here and so and then you go June, July, August, hopefully everything's up and running again. The economy starts coming back on track. Trump makes a couple of great speeches, but Biden is more in decline.  It's not going to get better.  No, those two face off. Trump's going to light him up like a Comedy Central roast. He's already dismissing him. He's there. He's like he's sleepy. Biden, he's like. But he's saying like someone said, Biden said, this goes first of all, he didn't write. That was Democratic operative. He probably doesn't even know what it says he's going to destroy. I'm going to kill him. I mean, it's such an easy target. It's like Mike Tyson versus a three year old.  It's true. It really is. It's it's it's a terrible fight.  I thought Bernie had a legit chance. Bernie had a legit chance. He had a legit chance because there's a lot of people that are in the middle that are, you know, a lot of people that are casually acquainted with politics that would listen to his message of doing good for the working class.  I think you helped out with the poor people.  I think you made them human. We used on him. I was like, I like that guy.  Would you have beaten? Not. No, really? No. Oh, man. What if he was like this awesome dude? Well, I'm sure he really was on stage and he comes in and just drops Knowland.  No, he never was like that. That's the thing. If you go back and listen to him from when he was younger, he was whip smart, very smart guy.  Very, very clever. Sure. All those very clear talke. This is this is a sign of decline. It is what it is. You wouldn't have minded a open conversation with all that shit that that Bernie Sanders thing was such a bummer. Why?  Because they turned all the stuff that I did and stand up and like things that have said on a podcast and put it in quotes as if I'm a homophobe or a transphobia or a racist or they just lied to make it look like Bernie was supporting some right wing person. But meanwhile, I'm left wing and I've never been right wing in my life. But also those people don't matter.  But it didn't matter as much as it it made me feel like this is a dirty business.  Like I don't want to be a part of your dirtiest business.  It's it's it's they're trying to change people's opinions with deception. It's not like they're trying to tell you how good their guy is. They're using deception.  Yeah, they're using fucker. It's sleazy. It's sleazy. It's a sleazy business. It's not a meritocracy.  After Bernie came on, did other politicians reach out? Oh yeah. Oh yeah. I'm sure a lot. Yeah. And they denied it too. I got emails. I'll release the inmates who I know a lot of them passed out will they reached out to the publicist, but I'm not interested. And look, I'm only interested in interviewing people that I thought were interesting, that I was interested in, like Andrew Young, interested in that guy. I like him, too.  I like them. Smart guy.  I love Tulsi Gabbard. I just think she's good to you know, she's so dangerous to those people that they they just they wouldn't want they were changing the rules to keep her from debating after she sank. Kamala Harris, they like this lady too dangerous. Kamala Harris, pretty hot yoga. Not bad. What's going on in your house?  I don't know. Do this. Quarantine's make me wait. Let's talk about people get crazy.  This is like a lockdown, man.  I don't know, man. I'm using words like exercise camp. I've been working out a lot. I work on things two, three times a day. Really? That's man, I ride my bike. I could, you know, eight, ten miles on the mountain bike. We went and sat on it.  We ran out of kettlebell so quick, everybody ran out of kettlebell at home workout. Right, man. Everybody wants a kettlebell because you could get an amazing workout in with one kettlebell. You sit it in the corner of your house, you know, put a great workout. Fuck.  Yeah, dude, I remember when I got that I'm not paying on time. I got palletizing. I do that things for bitches.  I don't know. I'm on there every day, every day. Sometimes two, three times a day on the dude.  I'm thick as fuck and I got a real bike. Oh it's not, it's nowhere near the same.  It's a lot harder when you're running especially much harder going up hills and shit. Oh my God. You're doing trails, trails, trail bike right behind my house. I'm like legit trails.  The thing that bugs me though is you look like you're running away to a mountain lion. Mountain lions have gone after bikers before.  And I thought I thought of you two days ago. I was on the trails at seven a.m. I was the first one there. So you can just see the fresh mud. I see these huge pawprints. And I was like, I remember you go and do do you have a knife or anything? And I have this fanny pack that I ride with, keep all my stuff. And I'm like and I look down like I have nothing.  I have a knife from this company called Half Half Face Blades and the the. And what is it like when you take a bunch of letters like ABC? What does it call when you when you just say ABC? You know, American Boxing Commission is just an abbreviation.  It's s h p o. S that's the name of the knife. It's a subhuman piece of shit.  So it's it's it's nice.  It's made it's like a spike, like it's it's shaped like if you really wanted it, if you were in combat, it's got a loop for your thumb.  So if you really wanted if you want to attack by a cat, I've thought this with another one.  Yeah, I have another one, four of them. I'll give you one of them. You want one? OK, thank you. You know, I don't have it here. I'll get you one. Please do. Yeah. I was so scared of this shit. It's a it's a Navy SEAL run company. Oh, hell, yeah. But this is the it's it's perfect.  I keep it on my I have a neoprene fanny pack that I run in my cell phone sits in here and I have that motherfucker.  Right. That's what I wanna do from now on. I used to I was running with earplugs on and listen to the music. But the problem is I run with the dog all the time. I want to be able to hear him. And then also rattlesnakes.  Yes. Do you see the picture I pose is my God, dude, I was on the train.  I sent it to you. Yes. Oh, they do. Look at this fucking round. It was a dragon, a straight up dragon.  And I have nothing. It was so thick. So the thing is, like, you're not fighting a rattlesnake with a knife, you know what I mean?  Look at that fucker.  Now, that was someone someone sent that to me. It's on. Is it right there? That's fucking thing, dude. Look at that. Look at this.  Why is this fucker. Yeah, that's a big snake. Malik, how thick is Luke?  And I was like, oh, look at the. That's a serpent, brother.  It's Tim Dillon. That's my agent. Oh, my God. I love him. Fucking I didn't see that.  Go do that. So again, I usually run with headphones on and that day I was run, I was on my bike and I just I took one out for whatever reason. I'm running and I hear something and I looked I sound like, holy fuck.  And I'm not scared of what? I'm scared of snakes.  I really am. You should be scared of rattlesnakes because they get you. It's a mess. Well, I'm usually with my son. I'm glad your kid gets bit by a fucking rattlesnake.  Think about all the time. I was looking at a house once and there was a rattlesnake right in the front yard. Oh, that's a bad sign. I killed it. Did you stomped on it head. Yeah. Fuck yeah. Because I was like, first of all, it's these people's house.  You know, even if I don't buy this house, if they have kids or dogs, they did have a kid. Oh, do you have to. But my wife is like, that's a bad sign. She's right. Yeah, son. Yeah.  But with that and I want to go that way. Was going back home downhill. I'm like, dude, please don't make me go back around six miles up. It's such a nightmare. And I was like, I'm just going to fucking run by it. And I just had this vision ahead of him fucking Leyshon out if I like.  So I was like to get some rocks are throwing rocks at them. This thing didn't give a fuck, dude. It was hit him in the head and just stared at me with pretty gangster. I like go back the long way. With the long way.  Dude, I was so scared man. You should be. You get bit by a rattlesnake. It is a real nightmare.  I'm in the middle of nowhere. I'd be so fucked.  It causes necrosis all around the injury like your tissue rots away.  There's some horrible websites that will show you what it looks like when someone gets bit by a rattlesnake and then they have to have multiple, multiple surgeries, skin grafts, all the shit, all the tissue around the injury dies as one guy got bit on his arm.  And I want to say it took him like thirteen surgeries to get back the use of his arm.  But I mean, over years, like, huge, like huge rotting hole where the bite was, where you could see the bone.  And they were the Mountlake. I'm thinking because I saw the big print, I'm like, that's a big fucking cat, man. How big was your hand? Little small in my hand.  They're big and they're out there. And there's a lot of them, man. I hope they're hungry.  Try to find a deer these days. Was last time he saw a deer. Can tell you especially around here. Yeah, I could tell you there should be deer everywhere.  If there's a deer and there's a buck and a doe and then there's a there's a bunch of other dogs. There should be deer everywhere. It should be like Pennsylvania where you like you can't drive at night if you're worried about hitting them. Pennsylvania doesn't have any mountain lions.  We got to fuck load of cats. And we have bobcats, too. We have coyotes.  Oh, fucking bobcat. You think you would. I don't think you had a forty pound cat trying to kill you. You'd be freaked out. Oh, for sure. The thing about a stupid thing about a mountain lion killing you is like it might be able to kill you, but I want to have something where I'm going to plunge it into his fucking eyeball. Give me that knife. Do. Yeah please.  It's like a spike. I thought if you see his website, go to the half face blades website. And I thought of you coming on the show being like you guys, you and Brian, sad and êtes there and I'm gone my seat open. And you being like I fucking told them I fucking doodle.  If you got killed by a mountain lion, become the mountain lion pasture food out. I said food out there and we're a fucking ghillie suit and be hiding in the bushes. That's what it looks like.  Oh yeah. But it's wrapped with it's not a metal handle. It's wrapped with paracord set.  See there's an image of it with the paracord. Yeah. Well either way I'm shoving that thing into some mountain lions eyeball.  It's so stressful. Yeah. Stop taking my son on that path. We go on a much smaller one now. Yeah, man, there's a lot of wildlife out there, but at least we don't have grizzly bears.  You know, we just we don't have cars, man. I'm just so scared now. I should be scared. You packing heat.  I got to do something and I go. I go deep, man. I go down the mountain on my bike. That's a good one.  To a spike, I think said, yeah, but I want to be able to cut to not just puncture. I just fucking Dogtown. Yeah, the subhuman piece of shit is my knife. That's what I thought it through.  But but your dog has encountered any snakes or anything?  No, no, he hasn't. But my other dogs had my Frank Sinatra, my pit bull when he was alive. He had been bitten three different times by rattlesnakes on the.  Never on the nose. Yeah, on his face. That's when they died. All right. He was a good dog with a tank.  He was so crazy, his face swollen up like a balloon. I had to bring him in.  Have you seen the the I saw some researchers saying there's rattlesnakes are aware that the rattle gives them away and people are killing them. So they're not rattling as much anymore. Oh, jeez. That's the kind of study they found out. So they're evolving. They're evolving, realizing the rattles, give them away to humans so they get killed. So they're smart and they're not rattling as much. Jesus Christ.  So I see that big snake. I go the other way. I see an old man walking down. I go, Dude, there's the biggest rattlesnake you've ever seen about 500 yards away. He was really Arrigo's. I have to go this way. My wife and kid are down there and they're coming up loose. Can you show me where I go. Sure.  I walk down, I go. He's right. He's not there. And then behind us we hear. Dude, I'm so scared I was running with my dogs once we're going down this hill on this trail and I ran over this stick and as I'm in the air over the stick, I realize it's a rattlesnake.  Oh, shit.  It's a big one. Like as thick as my forearm. Like, holy fuck, that was the biggest snake ever.  Did he do anything? No, just lay there. And then I started throwing rocks at them and screaming at my dogs to back up Jesus guys threw rocks at him and he got off the trail and he slithered into the bushes. It's so scary. That was a long time ago. That was more than 10 years ago. But I remember what was happening.  I was like, whoa.  I was like, that is a big fucking fat dick around like an old one.  And you're not going to do shit like it, bite you. It's not like there's going to be this tussle. No, no, no. If it bites, you're fucking out. Yeah, you're fucked.  And it's so bad you don't suck the poison out or cut it or any of that stuff that people say you wet it with a cold, damp cloth and you get to a doctor as quick.  What about it? I don't think so. I don't think you're supposed to do that. I don't I think that's all bullshit.  I think what it does is it digests the meat. See what what a rat what rattlesnake venom does is like when it stabs a rabbit or some shit, it's it doesn't have like it's it's not an animal that digests things the way that we do. And I think one of the things it does is the poison helps digest the meat because their poison doesn't just like kill the thing and paralyze thing, but it also breaks down the tissue. So then when it's eating it, it's like the necrosis of the tissue might have made all that up, not scents.  Sounds legit. Did you hear that? There's that rapper that Mike Mike. Not Mike's. That Mike Posner.  So he was running from California before Rattlesnake run in Colorado.  I think.  I figure is that he got bit by baby rattlesnake, which is more dangerous because babies don't know how to control their venom. The big ones do babies just like I and they release all their venom. So supposed to be more dangerous to get bit by baby. I heard that's a myth.  I might have made that up. No, I don't think he did make it up.  I heard it before. But then I remember reading that baby rattlesnakes are no more deadly than regular rattlesnake.  I know Mike Posner was fucked up because you do a rap in every city and then he was like doing a rap from his hospital bed fucked up. He was he was erroneous shit. He was stuck in there for weeks. Weeks. Yeah. Because the baby rather really fucked him up.  Well, my dogs got fucked up three different times. My female, she got fucked up once and my male got fucked up three times. So three different times I had to bring them in one time they both got fucked up but they're fine.  Yeah but they had to get antivenom and it's expensive. Yeah it's expensive. It's several thousand dollars for the antivenom.  So think about more female milk in the snake. Yeah of course it's expensive for some fucking dude milking the snakes.  You know, you can get immune to that shit guys the milk snakes and then they give themselves like a little bit of the time and eventually they get immune to it.  Then that's pretty nuts. Yeah. Like the snake handler dudes fuck everything.  Those dudes who handle snakes in church services. Oh my God. Fucking yeah, man. Let the fact that some old school fire and brimstone shit handling snakes.  Have you seen that evil priest he has like this real evil. Oh yeah. Yeah. His boys. I'm going to blow it all right.  Yeah.  That's that same guy that he got interviewed by some woman. She was asking him, do you think that poor people are demons?  I never said that. He's so scary. I never said that. You know, I swear he can tell you what's ahead a bit. Yeah. Like it's what is his name again?  Kenneth Copeland, is that it? Yeah, God, he's a scary, scary dude, and he got a lot of money, tons of flies, private and shit.  He's got his own jets, but now you can't have a crowd. So just him and his boys and they all they're all blown away. Crowd Yeah.  Which is really weird. He's doing the show with no crowd. I think you bought his jet from Tyler Perry. Tyler Perry's jet. Fucking right.  Do you know what is weird is Russell mania did it with no crowd. Yeah. You thought Russell was weird before. Try and watch it with no crowd. So strange.  It's so weird things with no crowd like people that are doing stand up with no crowd need to stop doing stand up with no crowd. Please stop doing it.  Stop doing that. We got a text that recently sent videos of people doing stand. It's tough.  Well, not only that, but the people that are doing stand up to the crowd, they're not good at it to begin with. They're not good at it with a crowd.  So then they do it with no crowd and like, oh, my God, this is a disaster.  It's such a it's the biggest disaster. Yeah, it doesn't work. Oh, my God.  It's so tough to watch on stage with no crowd in them, just like their punch line. It's just like, oh fuck.  I know people are talking about doing Zoome stand up. Get the fuck out of here.  My weight this I mean it's really it's going to come down to if they can do that with snake venom. Can't they do that with the fucking Korona. Just take it a little bit.  I'm I'm so optimistic about things I got to show. End of June in Spokane, Washington.  Do you really know about the gangster? Yeah, I think it's going to be overblown. Washington had a lot of deaths, but now they're the best because they've gone through it.  So now it's it's way down there. That's interesting. Washington, California is kicking ass, but Washington's kicking your ass in California because the fucking Pete.  What's the Jamie what's the latest when California is going to open up? See if it says it's interested in Los Angeles County, tried to have gun stores shut down saying that they're not essential and they put the kibosh on that with the quickness, hell, no quickness.  You're a shooter now. I'm a shooter, but I like it as fun as it was a good time, right? That's fine. It's good to know, it's good to know how to shoot accurately and not my guns at home.  But I can't I mean, I've only shot it once and it was just, you know, some bullshit, not like with legit trainers and coaches.  It's great, right? So fun. You get good at it. I want to go back out there because you had to shoot the cool gun, right? Did you know about it? I've shot a few shots before, but that day or two. I left shortly after. You can tell instead.  Yeah, no, it's it's a good thing to learn. It's a good thing to learn to learn how to handle a gun and learn how to use it correctly. Learn all the safety procedures but learn how to do it accurately. Use the proper technique. It's like everything else, like martial arts or everything. You know, you need to know how to do it right.  You get familiar with it. Yeah. Makes a big difference, man. You know, and doing a Taron tactical where they trained Cannery's or John Wick and Haileybury trained there for John Wick three and you know, he trained a bunch of people for movies is the real deal.  Yes. Nice guy to a lot of cops there to, you know, a lot of a lot of people practicing that need it for the line of duty.  Yeah. It's interesting you say he has a lot of Special Forces guys there. And I was like, oh, do they just kill this year? It's not really their thing. He goes to a lot of them come and they don't they don't do great because that's not it's just not what they practice that because once they get it down, yeah, they're monsters. But at first, no.  Yeah. The thing is, killing bad guys thing is not hitting metal targets. Well, yeah, they're you know, they the training training with a gun.  It's like training with everything else, you know, it's like the more you do it the better you get at it. It's that simple. It's just most people don't get the opportunity to do what we did to train with a guy like Teran and learn correctly, learn how to do it from a real master like that. A guy was one, you know, countless competitions.  He's fast with it. It's a weird thing, right, to be able to be really good at shooting something. How about I go? Can you imagine I don't you and Brannagh, can you imagine shooting a human like this? You sure can. Sure can. Imagine if someone broke into your house. Brendon Oh yeah. Oh yeah. No doubt you could.  Yeah, you could. Yeah. Well, that's one of the weird things. There are so many people that I know that are real anti-gun. They got guns when this whole thing went down. A buddy of mine, I want to say his name, but his wife was like, you can never have a gun in this house. It's like, oh, OK.  Soon the shit went down just like we need to get a gun, get a gun immediately. Yeah, yeah. Immediately.  Damn right. Rifle change. Anthony Smith fights home intruder man charged with criminal trespass. Yeah, you were telling me about that.  Apparently the guy was tough to like Smith said, and smaller than him said the guy was like a hundred and seventy pounds and the guy took everything you could throw at him, which is on meth, said no normal human being is is able to fight like that.  He said, I am by no means the baddest food on the planet. Listen, he's top 100. Oh, and all the humans on the planet. Anthony Simmons will top 100 badass motherfuckers on the earth. But he's a regular Joe. And I had a hard time dealing with him and he took everything I gave him every punch, every knee, every elbow he took every single one of them and kept fighting me. At one point, Smith said his mother in law brought him a kitchen knife, which she held to have a man who continued to fight him.  Why didn't you just choke him unconscious? That's a legit point. Why don't you just choke the fuck out of them?  Yeah, I just. I haven't said, hey, I'm sorry, as he walked by after things calmed down, hey, man, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I tried to kill you.  He said there was blood all over the computer and Hoppman was cut and had swelling on his face.  Yeah, did he? But he didn't lay anything on at the other speed to stop it.  But the guy took it. The fact that the guy only weight one hundred and seventy pounds and it says Smith fights it 205 pounds. He's walking around 230 miles.  Yeah. He's, he's smashing this dude that's, you know, a legit 60 pounds lighter than I am, which is crazy.  Said experience a wide range of emotions afterwards. I like Smith a lot, he's a very intelligent dude. Have you heard him as a man?  Yes, he has a future in that.  He's in the future and he's got a future in fighting, too. I want to you know, I mean, I think after he fought John Jones, he got the rub and he looked fantastic and great with Gustavsen.  If you remember that fight, he could have easily won that fight with that dequeue. He remember that. Think John hit him and they go, do you want do you want continue fighting or do you want to come. And he just he hit him with a lonely or four years down.  You remember that it was only when he is down and he goes, you want to stop the fighting, he would have won the fight. And he was. That's not my style. You just continue the fight. That's interesting.  I don't remember that. But yeah, I remember it vaguely. He's a bad ass man. He is. He's very, very smart guy.  What do you if you're going to act out and make the news, now's the time.  Because, like with John, like go away. Yeah. Like what? We're trying to not die. We don't give a fuck what John's doing. This is a little bit of that.  Right. But there's all we know about Jane angry. We know about John. Yeah, but the world doesn't, you think.  No, but like like even with Kobe's death, like have you heard anyone talk like that before this game? That was it was so heavy with that. No one's really even mentioned it. We are so focused on this fucking virus.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's interesting. I'm I'm curious to see when all is said and done, how many more people die of the flu than of dying of covid. Yes, because it's going to be higher. The flu numbers are going to be higher. It's what I mean, imagine if we just do this every time there's a a flu, there's a shutdown, don't you don't you think at some point with society we're going to get to a point where people are sick of being quarantined and they're going to look at the numbers and go, OK, these are the odds of me getting it and thought to me, survive it.  I'm not I'm not going to live my life like this man.  Yeah, you shouldn't, because the odds are you, you know, dying from driving in the same way. I mean, the other thing is when people leave the house that you're putting people at danger, OK, do you drive when you're putting people at danger, you know, and people die every year, 30000 people die every year from motor vehicle accidents in the United States.  Well, think about think how many lives have been saved because of the quarantine, because the no car crashes. That's a good point, except have you noticed how people are driving like fucking idiots? I drive 170 miles an hour everywhere I drive like I robbed the bank and it's out of the other day when I got to calm down, dude. So I spun my car out again on the four or five minutes ago.  Oh, dude, it's like no one's out. It's fuckin grand over Baghdad fucking yet. If I fucking do, I never get to drive. Like, the car's so crazy.  You can't drive like that in that car. That car's too bonkers.  It's so fun, dude. And no one's on Topanga Canyon or Malibu Canyon. Dude, it's so weird right here. Put a GoPro on. You guys should see the way I drive.  One of the things this makes me realize how much I would love living in a smaller town because I like it when there's no traffic man. But this feels different when you're driving around feels more relaxed. You know what?  I'm realizing how obscenely huge. But like to get to Pasadena or Hollywood or Santa Monica with no traffic easing, everyone's like 18 minutes away.  It's so nice. Yes. Yes. Two hours of its regular shit.  I know, right. Like, how much is it to get to San Diego right now? It's an hour and ten minutes. So easy. Yeah. San Diego is a nightmare. Driving to San Diego.  Dude, when I do La Hoya. Oh, you have to do a Thursday night show. Yeah. What time do you leave? I leave at noon. I leave at noon. I left at 11:00 last time. It still took me three and a half hours.  Yeah. Eleven's probably better because then you don't get that three o'clock traffic.  You hit that three. If you don't get past the O.C. by two o'clock you're fighting.  The O.C. is the worst traffic on earth. It's like right up there with Mexico City. Orange County, so crazy. There's so many people jammed in Orange County. Fuck how many they must have a lot of covid-19 in.  Not as bad as this really right up.  All of California is kind of kicking ass, I don't know, two and a half hours to downtown San Diego right now. It says that, yeah, that's a nice if you drive like a bitch to drive like about an hour and a half. I started looking at ways to kind of modest even. But, you know, when you talk to Porche enthusiasts, I do. Don't fucking touch it.  Don't touch your cars too fast as it is. You're not going to make it faster. It's just so good. The G2 is a rare, perfect car. It's perfection. They just it's one of those rare cars where right off the assembly line, they nailed it.  I love that fucking car. It's a beast of a car, man.  Do you think you could ever live in San Diego? That's one of the places I think I can live to me, too. I started out with Kalimna, said if I didn't have to be in L.A. for entertainment purposes and stand up, I'd move to La Hoya.  Yes, you house in La Hoya and it's quiet. Good families. Yeah, very nice. And restaurants, coffee clift's.  Oh, do you know how many restaurants are going to be open? How quick do you think everything bounces back.  People have to, they have to bounce back. So I bet people to be eager to bounce back.  Man Right. But the restaurants that are going under oh it's going to take a long time for the rebuild and reopen.  The other thing is because you're off the a theater slash arena act. I think it to me, I think September or October you may find free, but June, July, August in theaters. Me tough toughman.  Yeah, unless they ask people to wear a mask or some shit or maybe, maybe, maybe at the you know, the the regular kind of comedy places like the comedy zones and helium's one of the six people coming in test their temperature coming in.  You know. But then you're in line with all those people, like imagine if you're in line and some dude's got the fever and you he's right in front of you and they test him like, sorry, you have to leave. Like, look, I know. Back away. Back away.  I saw World War Z Day. Not a good idea.  Not a good idea. During all this, do those people were talking about out of shape? If zombies come, you're you're even more fucked up. Before first was, you know, saying my thing about zombies were always in The Walking Dead.  Why is this lasting years? How are there still zombies? What do you what the fuck? What are they eating? How are they staying alive?  So they're zombies and they're slow zombies. The slow zombies. I feel like we could wipe them out in a day.  Yeah. Why are they so slow? And then then the world is like, fuck that. Like zombies. Yeah.  Well, the twenty eight days later were the first fast zombies. That's true. They were the first fast zombies. There were the scary zombies 28 days later.  Still to me from my money, that's the scariest fucking horror movie. It's a scary zombie zombie movie, I should say.  Most realistic World War Z is up there, though, man. Yeah, it's done. Is violent.  There's some violence in twenty eight days later, like Jesus Christ, where people have to hack other people apart, their loved ones.  Yeah, like boyfriends and girlfriends hack each other apart and they realize the person just got it and they're about to turn.  Well how about Brad Pitt with his girlfriend on the plane. She got Bennie fucking hacksaw arm off. Remember, I don't remember that before the on the plane, she got bit and he's like, let me see your arm. And he's like, buy down this here. Koosh cuts her arm off, then they're on the plane and they're chill and everything's all good. And then someone up, the zombie comes out the back and he's like, oh, shit.  Takes the grenade, throws it on the plane.  Why do I not remember this through this movie's fantastic writer? Brad Pitt's my favorite. Yeah, yeah, because they're there and she's biting down and he's like, bite down, but it's on the plane, you know, on the plane is when he throws the bomb.  See, she got bit right here. Oh, see, I got this way. Saves her life. Oh, that's right. He's like, right.  He's boobage the pit start. Oh yeah.  I think, Brad, I didn't get that far in the movie. Oh, well, yeah, well, I watched that the first time I got that far, but the other night only got an hour into it, could it not? Not even I then got 40 minutes into it. Fantastic movie.  And I was like, Do you think Brad Pitt sleeps with Brad Drips or what do you think? Is he look like that? He looks great. I know. I know. Weird, right? Like, how he doing that? I don't know. Genetics, when he took off his shirt for once upon a time in Hollywood, am I going with this guy diabetes because he's 32 years old? Ridiculous. Yeah, not bad at all. Nothing.  What do you think that's just constant exercise, genetics, and then meanwhile, no Instagram posts of him lifting at all.  Does he even have an in escrow? The famous you have to be there. I have an Instagram. How about Chappelle? Chappelle doesn't have Instagram either. Nothing. Not a few people that are smart. They just like, why am I doing this?  You could do you could do without it. You didn't like it, but you could do without it.  And nothing would change for you. Yeah, but it helps to have an ability to express yourself if something comes up, you know, and like if you want to promote something, if you need to let people know about something like what? Like chose. Yeah. I think you'd be all right.  Yeah. But when you're doing arenas you really kind of need something like that. You know, you should sell 15000 tickets, 18000 tickets.  You let people know because otherwise they have to let them know through other means that costs money, how to show it to us.  He goes on like Live Nation theaters, he does mostly theaters to him like that. People find out he's in a place that has 3000 tickets are gone, like keep going. It's like when you go from 3000 to like. Madison Square Garden, then you're into the eighteen thousands and in New York doing regular mass square garden. Yeah. You doing Big Boy today? I'm doing Boston Garden the week later.  Back to back, son. I love it, yeah, it's crazy.  How about the comics who got their special on Netflix late night during the quarantine SIGIR saga, Krischer de next week, Giulia's Tuesday and up until is Tuesday. Yeah, it's a good move. The best move. Yeah.  And the comics like Andrew Schultz and fuckin Theo Von Who are going to who are going to shoot it like last month and er it either fucked.  Well they're not fucked because they're going to, it's like it's always better anyway.  Just heightens your material up. You spend more time with. No one can do material though. Yeah.  But you're going to have time to think about it. It's time to change your perspective. Some things I think almost any thought that you have as a comic is it's almost there's a time where it's too much, but most of the time you put them out and you're like, oh, God, I wish I had a couple more.  You know, almost always everything I've ever done. I wish I had three more months. Yeah. I wish I would've waited six more years.  And it's well, those things bad. But also I tell everybody, when you're doing standup and you're doing a special, the special is only 60 to 70 percent. It's funny as it is being there.  It's never as funny as who it is because they're part of the fun is you're at a live show with all these people trying to find one, turning off the vibe, the energy you miss.  And most of that with the Netflix, how you stop watching Dierking and you go all the way. I finished it. I'm only on. We did episode five last night, so I have two more to go.  OK, but you're kind of in the thick of it. I'm in the thick of it. Did you get where the guy has the hot nanny?  No, that's coming up. OK, it's like the hottest nanny I've ever seen. Really.  Well, it's the show is fucking so strange.  But if you had a TV show, like a fiction show that was that strange, you wouldn't believe it. You wouldn't believe it. You go. This shows too over the top.  How about the street kid? He just turned gay. Just needed meth. Trump Mols Agio exotic. Pardon.  Brigstock, have you seen you know how he's doing. His his his press conference. Someone asked that question. Yes. Not King but that's not what he said.  He said I'll take a look just to shut the guy up and he's like who. Who who said that Don. Was it my son. It was. It was his son. He goes, which one was it like? He knew it was Don. Don's kind of crazy, but it's I don't know. I didn't get to the part where they go into detail about the murder for hire conviction. So I don't I don't know if he did or didn't do it.  My thing. Yeah. I mean, I just worked for you.  I don't know if he did or didn't light his place on fire. Definitely did, definitely did OK, did that woman feed her husband to the tiger? I don't know. But you know what sucks for her? Let me stop. Definitely did. Definitely did. But, you know, sex for her sex work got away with it because it's such a hit. And now everyone, they open back up the case. She's all fucked.  Well, they should I must say, it's has been was worth millions. He disappears. She runs a tiger sanctuary. Strange. She's got tigers, she has meat grinders, and she has things that will eat hundreds of pounds of meat and can point this out or something should be noted is so and says something about killing a person with the tiger.  And they go, yeah, you could just rub some sort of meat on the boots. And she was just starting to split sardine.  That's what she said. That sardine oil on super particular.  Yeah, it's like sardine oil. Oh OK. Yeah, they've found the video of his wedding online. And is it real. Yeah.  Well they played it in the show. Yeah. Yeah. But like I, they uncovered the full video of it like people have and this is apparently a pretty wild tape too.  It's twenty three minutes long and these two guys that were both straight are kissing in the well.  How does that mean. What is straight. Did they get their dick. Ha. Did they fuck guys like you're gay.  Well now they say ok well but the what the what. You call them straight.  Well no the well the one homeboy who was like six six was kind of the guy piece because I came here to fuck these tigers and the next and I'm sucking his dick because he got and he actually that boy want to play the tigers so bad.  But Joe Exotic goes he was out on this and this is actually a joke who I forget who it's from. But I knew it when he said, I'm like, wait, I know someone's joke that he it's not his it's not original because he goes he knows when he watch porno. Do you like do you like a guy with a little dick with Big Dick. And he goes, well big tequila's then you ain't that guy. That's somebody's joke. I think it's Ron Waitz or Damarys, but it's a joke that I've heard that's interesting.  It's a Joe Exotic said that in the show, right? Yeah. And I was like, oh, that's funny. You ain't that straight. He said, yeah. Yeah.  So that's his new guy. That's the new guy. I got to that like Joe Exotic. So he's in a coronavirus isolation.  I believe he contracted it. Really. All right.  He said he did that boy do anything, sell some fucking Harvey Weinstein. He's got it. Well, you got to think about your inside a fucking prison. There's no ventilation. You're in there with a bunch of dudes who have nothing to live for. Everyone's cooped up, no windows, nothing's open. You can get in the air in there. If someone's got something, everybody gets up. Everybody gets it. It goes like fire through bushes, through the whole cell block.  I'd imagine where you do let them go. Yeah.  Chicago jail is a top U.S. hotspot as virus spreads behind bars. Lese 1324 confirmed coronavirus cases are tied to prisons and jails across the United States, including at least thirty two deaths.  Wow. What's that percentage?  Thirty two of the thirteen hundred. It's pretty good. I like my odds. Like my. I'll take those odds. You ever have these CBD killers not have a drink? That is caffeine in them? No. 25 milligrams of CBD. Why not? Well, yeah. You should drink a little whisky, man. You want to fuck. Yeah.  OK, what else what else are we going to drink at home. Jamie's going to get us some glasses, get some glasses and a little bit of ice to show after this. Yeah, I'm doing something with Ari. I'm doing Ari's video. He's doing some video series.  How's he doing? He's hiding. He's in hiding. He's he's in a state, not New York, until everything like people stop dying and then he's going to go back. He got freaked out.  He fled the city. He said, yeah, was a smart move. Yeah, I, like so many people, fled the city. I mean, the city's basically I mean, John Joseph sent me a video the other day of me on the Madison Square Garden billboard, and I saw you posts the streets.  It's great. No one there. It's it's crazy. It's everyone's dead. Oh, he left because he scared the Crono. Yes, I think they are lying because the Kobe thing, people forgot about that by now.  Are you good, baby?  Yeah, you probably forgot about it. You know, a few people that have not forgot about. Thank you, sir. A few people that have not. But yeah, he won't do that again.  No less than I hope so. Jesus Christ.  That was a bad move. I said, oh, he's always been nice to me. He's a great guy. I love how he's been. I salute. Cheers, brother. Hey.  Not good for the immune system, but good for the baby.  All right, a little bit of a little drink ypu a day. Not bad for you. I've been drinking one glass of wine every day. Really suits me.  Really. I've never felt better. You don't realize how much traveling and flying fuck you up. I feel great, but fucked you up.  And I've been thinking about that a lot. I've been re-evaluating a lot of choices.  You know how comics do residencies in Vegas. Yes. Why? I do a residency in L.A..  Like if you want to come, you want to come see me. I'm at the fuckin Ace Theater I'm at. You should do that. I'm thinking about it. You're at that level. You should def.  That's a brilliant idea. I'm thinking about going on the road sometimes, but being here a lot more than many people travel to L.A. to see you.  Yeah, well, we get a lot of that at the Comedy Store, man. We got a lot we get a lot of international tourists to people that know that I'm not going to Ireland, so I'm not going to Scotland. So they'll come here. So you should do that.  I'm sure I should, but I know I'm not going. Oh, no, I'm going. But I'm saying you should. You should. Yeah. L.A., I'm going to Ireland. April 2012.  Yeah, I would go. But I mean, I'm still doing a lot of shows but I'm doing shows in L.A. too, like I'm at the forum on October four. On November 1st.  Yeah. Yeah.  I'm, I'm still doing like the regular shows. I'm assuming, you know, I'm assuming there won't be a second wave of Corona or some sort of crack and be fine.  Man Yeah. That's a brilliant idea.  The residency in L.A., no one's ever done that. I don't know, they should do Vegas, Vegas sucks cock. Well, think about what I do at the Improv and at the store or have there's Joe Rogan and Friends shows, and you do them all the time if you want to.  Three times a week. Yeah. Think of many people. That is. Well that's what I'm saying.  OK, no one else, a lot of other guys aren't doing that either. But you can do that. Good. Yeah. Yes you do. I'm doing. But that to me is like the best way for me to stay sharp. Your definition of 45 minutes an hour, how many guys you know at your level who are doing 45?  Moser's doing their 15 minute spot at the store at the Improv or factor. You're a different animal.  You got to you got to do that, though. You have to name one of the guy, Joe, who's doing that?  I don't know. Go on. Wait, I'm not paying attention, but I am.  There's no one else that does that like you.  Well, I do it because I'm doing arenas. You know, you're doing an arena, man. You got to be. And I've only started doing arenas the last two years. You've got to be sharp. You can't you can't be fucking around 15000 people paid money to hear you talk. And I'm just constantly I've I've worked harder this past year to, like, ramp everything up than I ever have with stand up. Yeah, it's inspiring.  Makes me realize that there's more you can get more out of it. You can get more, you know, you put more work in, you get a little bit sharper, more listening to sets, more writing, more, more thinking, you know, just more.  You know, the thing is that people respect you as a stand up to drop off after a while. That's what a lot of comics do. Their material drops off.  They run out of things that are interesting, especially when they get famous. That's the problem. They don't relate to the to the average person.  Also, they don't take as many chances. They don't say as many because they're worried. Yeah, it's different, you know.  Yeah, I get it is what it is, man. You know, you're going to get a break a few eggs, but you're going to make a lot of omelets.  Yeah. I just I in the sole quality I think the thing I miss the most besides going on the road miss. It's so bad. It's just hanging out with seeing everybody, you know, hanging out at the store.  Oh. I mean, text everybody was not the same as that. No, it's not, Joey, I'd offer you this joint, but I know you don't want to. I'm going to get really weird if I'm not.  Yeah, Joey. Joey just calls.  So I spent a lot of time talking to him. Yeah, but it's it's not the same sort of thing going to the store.  It's like, dude, the party when we get back, what is that going to be like when we get back to the store and everyone's at the back bar and everyone's hanging out, everyone's doing shows again. We're going to be so thankful because we know it's never been taken away before in the history of comedy. There's never been a time where you couldn't perform. Never.  Never. I guess the only time with L.A. comics when there's the strike, right? Yeah, but you could do the road. Yeah, doing that. You guys are doing it, though. There's like Leno doing the road back to back then law. Those guys weren't big enough names.  That's interesting. I wonder how many of comedy clubs were around back then because I was in the what, the 70s or 80s.  70S, right. Late 70s. You had a strike. You had Lemmer Leno. Do you read that book Dying up here? No, that's what the series was based off of. Yeah, but the series was real dark. The books makes it seem like it was a fuckin like the store's fun man.  Do you think the store was more fun than a more fun now?  You tell me, dude, you're you know. I don't know. I don't know. I don't know anything different.  Like I read those times. I think back then it was like a lot of guys were doing standup to get TV shows or to get noticed. And now you have like a bunch of the top guys. All they want to do is be really good comics.  Well, you have freedom that way and you don't have anybody telling you what to do. And you don't have to worry about so many different things. You have to worry about. If you have a TV show, TV shows, you have to worry about the other actors. The writing the network does get picked up.  Does it this does it that a lot of chefs in the kitchen, so many things outside of your control.  And, you know, if you have a controversial, controversial act, a lot of times the networks don't want you to do standup. Like apparently they did that to Tim Allen when he had that home improvement show that Tom stop doing standup.  Yeah. Like, stop making so much money. He's like, you think Bob Saget, too, when he was doing Full House, he didn't do any standup.  And you watch Istana Miss Surprise. You're like, oh, dad, he's a dirty boy. Yeah, dirty. Yeah. So dirty boy. And people here, any town of dirty. I know. And you hear that. You like what I know. This is outrageous. Yeah.  There's a there's a freedom to stand up, but it's also like I think more people appreciate it as an art form now, whereas back then it was like it didn't get respect.  It was if you got respect when you're on TV, you know that that's how you made you not and that's how you get famous TV or a movie. You were doing movies, you know, now once you say it. Standup and podcasting.  Yeah. Really? Yeah. Well, podcasting right now, it's emerging as a different beast.  See, before people would joke about it, they would go, what are you doing? Like Howard Stern used to make fun of it. Like, why not just yell out your window, what are you doing? And you know, but he was coming from you got to think he's a pioneer in radio and traditional radio.  And he made his bones radio and he carved this path and radio. And then also this thing comes along where anybody can do it.  That's a threat. It's a little bit of a threat. It's a little bit of that. But it's also see, in a way, I understand his perspective, because in his day when he made it, he had to compete against all these other killers. Right.  So you got all these other morning guys all over the country. And then when he goes in syndicate, so he'll invade Chicago and he's invading Los Angeles, trying to take over, take it over.  But there was only a few slots, right. So you couldn't you couldn't listen to his show later. You had to listen to it then. Yeah. So everyone's competing during these slots. So you have this slot that is 6:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. That's Drivetime baby.  Even now he doesn't know podcast. And like I remember, I used to listen to Howard for a long time, probably like maybe a year ago they brought up something because you shit on podcasting is the podcast. There's even make money. And one of the guys got on there, you know, I forget his crew's name is, I think Joe Rogan Disease. I know, but not not tons of money. Like, it's not it's not set. I want to call, like longtime listener First-Time Caller.  Well, it doesn't matter what man.  I just thought it was weird. Like, did you still you still don't give it respect like you shitting me. Who do you think he's hanging around with though? You know, like his wife. Yeah, Amara's wife. Maybe a few other really rich friends that are probably famous. I mean, I don't know how much you get to have your ear to the ground.  Being a guy in radio all the fucking time famous. When people get so famous, it's almost impossible. It's almost impossible to keep it together.  You're not bumming out. And again, I'm a huge Howard Stern fan. I think you I think maybe I forget who sent it to me, but I sent you when Howard Stern it released that to his employees.  He like a a yearly like meeting with his employees. Someone recorded it. Yeah. It makes you feel so sick.  Like Fuck did such a bummer. You realize how Hollywood is your. Oh, fuck, dude.  No, I think people get seduced by it, man. I think they do. They get seduced by the idea of, you know, first of all.  You need friends, you need really good friends that are like you, that are in your world, and I think one of the things that separates us, all of us as comics from the rest of Hollywood is like, God damn, were glued to each other.  Yes, we're glued and we shit on each other and we laugh and we compliment each other and we love each other. And we call each other. We tell each other. We love each other.  Yeah, 100 percent full support. It's different, man. It's different. We're a different thing.  And no one. But also it's not a dog eat dog. You. No, just trying to. Hello dude. When someone murders it, everybody's running out of that room telling everybody that when you see Bill go on stage in the main room and crush it, you're coming out and saying it. And I'm coming out and saying it and count saying it. We're all excited like, God damn, that was awesome. What a set. Holy shit.  And we'll tell them people you see crush it. Oh, my God. He crushed it.  You know, there's a there's a love for the art and a love for each other and the camaraderie like the the wanting people to be good.  You realize like it doesn't have to just be about you.  And they didn't.  I don't think they I think that's you know, we're talking about competition earlier. We're talking about Jordan and Tyson and the crazy, the like.  That's Howard Stern when it comes to radio, man. Yeah, you're right. You got to realize that's the motherfucker that he he fucked them all.  Have you heard him apologize for the way he treated some people? Yes. I think one guy, like, commits suicide and he's like, I felt bad for that, you know, because he would go in and was like at that time, that's what I had to do.  Well, that's what he did, right? Whether he had to do it or not, that's what he did. It worked like, yeah, it did work. And you felt like you had to do. And look, he's also we have to everything you have to look into, you've got to look at it perspective.  And in my head, what Howard Stern is always going to represent is the guy who paved the way. Yeah.  Like without him, you've got to realize there was nothing like Howard Stern before Howard Stern. It didn't exist. You had Don Imus, who's kind of risque. And then here comes this really tall, long haired rock and roll type dude who doesn't give a fuck. And he just wants to have porn stars on a girls ride and vibrators and people are fart and songs into microphones. It's madness.  And he's getting sued by the government. Man. So the government, they're coming down with these huge judgments against the company that owns it. And he keeps going and he keeps going.  Podcasts all are you know, Patrice used to say, like Patrice, you say about other comics that like David tell David Telx got a lot of babies. And what he meant is that there's a lot of other comics that would imitate David Tell. Yeah, they would do it just out of the fact that they were fans and they were insecure.  And they're doing they're not they're not plagiarists.  They just were not that good. Yet when I was young man, I sounded I used to sound exactly like Richard Jeni really heard myself on stage when I had been doing an open.  I caught myself doing like a bad Richard Jeni impression with my material when I was like 21 or something like twenty to like, oh, my God, I'm terrible because I was such a Richard Jeni fan at the time that I was like, mimicking him on stage on purpose.  A lot of comics do it, man. We find ourselves doing it with different acts.  I'll find myself. And sometimes I have a lot of mannerisms like Brian or Delia, because you're around them all. Those are my I'm molded by that. So that's my normal. Yeah.  But then eventually, like, you break out of it and you become your own thing. Yeah.  We got to all realize that what Howard Stern did before anybody was he created this radio chaos, he created this chaos. We had these these people these were backpackers were out of their fucking minds.  And he would interview them and and talk to all these nutty fucking people. That was the first one I remember he had celebrities on.  But he wasn't like, oh, how's your movie? He liked who he fucking. Yeah, right. And then they wouldn't answer it, but then he would circle back down somehow, get it out of it. It was a different world back then.  The world was different and and he made it possible for people to talk the way we talk.  And then Opie and Anthony were the next important phase because what Opie and Anthony were, we're a hang.  Where's Howard is the man behind the switchboard and Howard is in control.  Was he was his universe with Opie and Anthony.  People would just show up like I'd be on the air and it would be like four or five other comics there.  And we would we would love it. And Jim knows it all the time. All the time.  Jim was regularly so talented. He's he's one of the more unique comics ever. He's a very interesting guy.  I love Jim, his love. Transsexuals and how he's just the way he talks, he's just so honest and raw.  But what Opie and Anthony were the first loose hang, you know, it's like Anthony would kind of be orchestrating a little bit wary, like keeping everybody making sure, you know, keeping an eye on everything, making sure it didn't get out of hand.  And then, Anthony, is this very he's a guy who grew up doing construction and that's literally how he got into radio, but is also very intelligent, very inquisitive. So he's got like a regular guy sensibility, but he's also very fucking smart. Yeah. And then he would have you would have all these comics. And then Norton, who's a great comic himself, would be there and he'd be Colin Quinn and and Bellbird me and Shiftier and all this madness.  Man, it was nothing like that really.  No non radio, not a radio, but that's what made podcasts become what they are, because like those guys, let comics just hang out and talk. No one had ever read comics. Just hang out and run the show before Opie and Anthony. So the big steps to podcasting where Howard Stern is the most important. And then after Howard Stern, these are Howard Stern's babies. Howard Stern's babies like Opie and Anthony were Howard Stern's babies, but they became their own thing, just like a comic would imitate David tell when he's a young guy.  And then as he gets older, he finds his own speed. And there's a lot of comics right now that are like top level guys that I bet if you watch them 10, 15 years ago, they would sound a lot like someone else. And then Opie and Anthony open up the door to podcasting because they made comics where they could just hang.  And then everyone's got their own style. Like Ron Funchess has his own style. Eric Griffin has his own style. You and Brian have your own style. Theo's got his completely unique style. All of us have these different things. SIGIR has got his style. Christina Perski and him together have their style. SIGIR and Krischer Krisha's got to star.  He's got to style Burton br. Yes, but no, they have a great podcast, too. But it's just like the world is more beautiful than it was back then.  It's not like Bert and Bert are competing against Bert like it would if Bert Show was one was run by one production company. But Bert and Burr were run by a different. They're both going to be at noon and you have to listen to one or the other. And Bert and Burr and this fucking argument, you traitor, you know, you were you it was lost together. Fuck you. And, you know, now they're going to take us out of noon, you know, like, that's that's that was what they had to deal with.  It was a totally different dynamic. Now it's a totally it's like we were trapped in these tunnels fighting for air and pop and we got to the top of the tunnel and there's all the air you want.  It's free air, free air. You can just put up a podcast, put up a video, put up, put up, make a video, make a sketch.  You do your own sketch. You do whatever you want and then it might get sued by a million people. Yeah.  Like that fucking coronavirus song that I reposted on my Instagram. Those dudes are hilarious.  How many millions of views did that get? Millions and millions of views.  So these guys, they create this coronavirus song. It's on my Instagram. Who are who?  The gentleman that I am. I got a couple of people saying that they've also created the song first or whatever, so I don't know who.  Oh, no, whoever did it was smart and nobody got robbed. But whoever did it, those dudes were hilarious and it got millions and millions of views.  There's nothing from twenty years ago, thirty years ago where a regular guy could do something and by itself would get millions and millions of views.  But today, if you see some shit that's really funny and you send it to me and I send it to Jamele and it just starts going, if that's what happens, it goes through people.  These dudes, I'm saying four million, six hundred and eighty five thousand six hundred forty four views on my Instagram alone.  Can we play it or. No, no, I haven't heard. I'm sure they have their songs but it's.  Yeah, it's Reggie. Reggie baby too. And somehow or another he's got he's doing so well that he's got fake Instagram sites where people pretend they're him. But all this shit is funny. All this shit is just they're doing sketches. So these are Chicago based guys, just funny dudes in Chicago that are hustling and are constantly making contact constantly. They have new videos up all the time.  And who else is on him? His Instagram, that video just go to it so we could see it. The other guys. The other one is Stick's Excessed Estie. I underscore eight and then Funny Man, Gailen Geet Title I and and then laid three. Those are the dude who did it. And then Vinny Pazienza, Boxcutter Pazzi who was has been on the podcast before. I found it on his Instagram so reposted his.  But it's to see.  But imagine that. Thirty years ago, or one one dude could make something and it could go to something like, you know, Instagram, in this case three or four dudes could do it and go to something like Instagram. And also millions of people are singing it, laughing and it's hilarious.  Oh, but even think with Burton Burr, if we want to do a show, think if the 80s or 90s, you'd have to pitch it to network, have them approve it. Yeah, they bring in writers you're looking at how long would that take to evolve into a legit show greenlit. Then get a pilot then test. Well yeah.  No, no chance. Yeah. And also people would start fucking with it. They would come in. But I want you to address different. I want you to address that. I want you to once like Sinatra, I see you people taking you more seriously if you're wearing a suit doesn't too much better.  Can you tone it down. You seem aggressive.  Imagine if I went to a production company and said, yeah, well, I want to do is like smoke weed and talk a lot of shit and say things I don't really mean.  But I think it's funny at the time that I regret it and I drink a lot. Oh, no, we're going to air the fights. I'm have my dumb ass world is flat and we're going to smoke weed and we're going to talk shit. But but also I'm going to have presidential candidates and really serious jokes and scientists and me, a guy with brain damage. I'm going to debate important topics to them about politicians on. To have politicians on.  Yeah. Ask authors. Yeah. Everybody get like the fuck out of this office.  Well, when Brian and I were at Fox, they want to make it a TV show, like a legit TV show.  Remember that masked dude? I remember when they were telling you to not curse. Yes. And I was like, get out now. I remember yelling at you. They're like vampires. They're trying to bite you. They're trying to turn you, me and Brian in that Monarchos.  And I was like, this is what?  But meanwhile, they liked you because of who you were before they came along. Before they came along, you were cussing.  And then they want to do a sport. They don't know what to do is they want to do a sport. Show us. They brought me in and go. They go, they go, so we know it's a fun kid. What if we what if we replace Brian Cowen with Michael Rapaport?  No, they want to get rid of Brian. Why? Is it because he's old?  This is because of his arrogance, because he's old and he just touch it, or is it the way he dresses? Because I can fix that. That's crazy. But a bunch of dummies. This is this is great. Let's fuck it up. And this thing that I really like, let's ruin it.  But then they they're like, wait, they're making how much money? And we signed. No, no, no. So let's hey. Next year the deal is up in December we need half. And I went, oh, that's not happening. All right. Well, December just last month and I think we're in October. That's fine. We're going to go do our own thing and take all the money they want, OK? And then and I'll never forget this because I don't hear about this on a podcast just right out December.  And I went, why can't do that? Listen, no, I'm leaving. Goes don't do that. All right, cool. Next day I go in the park. So in December, our contract is up to the one half hour shit. I tried going back the next day and with their security up front, they wouldn't let me in as my last day at Fox.  And really, you know, we just started doing it randomly.  Well, that's the real clear changing of the guard where that old school mentality, they think that they own the talent, they think they own you.  The idea that they think they have 50 percent just yet.  But what are you doing? What are you doing? The guy gets on Africa. This guy gets to cast the guy who gets in my face.  I don't say his name. He goes, just how you have your black belt in fighting of my black belt in entertainment.  And they go, oh, my God, I would I would fall on the ground and start curling up in a fetal position laughing so that to me, I was like, I have no idea what you're referring to.  What is that to leave now? You know, how to rob people out of the percentage that they really deserve. What are you bringing to them?  That's why I said that's that's why I tell them I went, if you can show me why you get the 50 percent, I'll give you 50. Go. Here's what's our studio. You know, Fox Fox gives you the platform. Hold up with a platform before I even got here. I can do this up the street. We get more views. Dude, why would you get 50 percent? He's a guy. I don't know, man.  There's no reason. I had a guy not that long ago asked for fifty percent of my podcast to be a part of a network not that long ago.  I worked for him four years ago. Maybe I was like, what are you talking about. Fifty percent.  We like certain comics want to start podcast. Go hey this network podcast. When it came to me then what. Fifty percent. But then give me. No no stop stop. Don't do that yourself.  That's a weird number. Like you're pretending that they couldn't do it without you. If you want 50 percent, 50 percent is like if you and me right. If the Brendon and Joe show what kind of has to be fifty percent because it's both of us.  Right. So it's like there's two of us. Yes. So you're part of the show. I'm part of show we need each other or the gear together should be fifty percent. That makes your friends should be 50 percent. But we could do it with Tom the producer or we could do with Steve, the network executive. This is you guys no matter. So you can't have fifty percent.  Maybe you definitely deserve something. Fifty to fifty crazy.  It's insane. That's crazy. That's a crazy number. That means you're saying I can do without you. That does, that doesn't make any sense. But that's what they used to do with TV shows.  You got to realize if you're thinking about Hawaii five oh. Like the production company has a deal with the network and they put it together and everybody gets paid. And the people that are putting it on television have a giant chunk of that.  That's the studio executives. Network executives go to their houses, their big fucking parties. Do I go to some of their houses? Man, they'd have parties and you'd be like, wow, these guys are balling, but what are they doing?  What are they doing? They're taking your stuff. And they're the critical mechanism that is necessary to get you on television. Well, now the world is television. Our heads are through the fucking holes, and now we're looking out this open air.  There's no need for someone to take fifty percent anymore. No, no wonder people don't give a fuck. It's on Fox.  They don't. That's how they always operated. And those those fans will just drivers or whatever network. They're going to follow me. If I'm here, if I'm here, they here.  They don't get it. Though these guys went through the Fox system, people went through the ABC system, they went through the CBS system. And if they were in that system twenty years ago, this was this system. The system is you make deals, you put together shows, you're getting it on the air.  It's you're you're getting it.  You're giving you're very valuable. It's a very important thing to if you got on CBS back in, you know, 2000 change, it was a very important thing. So it made sense. The deal made sense. But it doesn't make sense on the Internet. The Internet is everybody's it's like everybody has a CBS, like these gentlemen who made that video on the coronavirus.  They don't have a network they don't need they don't need it. All it has to do is get to one of these social media, but also if it's good, people are going to believe this was the original maker.  He asked to be tagging their video.  They made a video, I believe, of his song, just, oh, OK. This is GMAC Cash, GMAC, GMAC Cash. And he's Detroit's finance. So he so he made the original song for sure.  I believe so, yeah. OK, once again, that's GM a oh, follow him right now.  So here, great avatar pick, by the way. Yeah. Full body. I don't see a lot of that.  What's up with the Avatars? I don't see a lot of text. Someone all of a sudden they send you back. Would you like to update your contact picture?  I know some weird avatar. I don't want that.  What is that? What's happening here? Why are people losing their mind? Why are you sending me a picture of you?  Yeah, I don't need a picture Mac Cash to find them. Yeah, I got them 34000 followers. Yeah.  Right now you're seventy four thousand. Let's blow them up to.  Oh he has a video is on video that song and only give me one comment. It's the same song. This is him. Sorry I can hear. What's happening, you have no sound. What's going on? Looks like he's saying the same words. Oh, I have it in my phone. He's the original virus. That's it. That's the song. OK, so he's the original. He's he's the guy who made the song.  And then those other boys took it and just blew it up. They had a great dance routine, though. They they did something to added a little they had a great video there jumping around, spraying like somebody dude is doing back flips. Somebody said, oh, they did something.  Yeah, it's good, but they do a bunch of shit. This is their coronaviruses video. They just riding around spraying it. Great shoes. Yeah.  But you know, this is one of those things that happens sometimes.  Like you don't know who the fuck made a video. Someone sends it to you. You don't know who made a song. Someone says to you, you add on things to be fun. Did you see that?  I meant with that. That's like what's going on with Ticktock. Like someone makes a great video and then everyone else kind of jumps on that trend. Taking that sound. There is a video I saw just yesterday or two days ago about the government telling all government employees not have Tic-Tac on their government issued cell phones. Why?  Because it's an issue. Well, they think it's a security issue. It's a Chinese company to talk. Yeah.  And someone made some really grandiose statement like Take Top is like a government operative application or something like that. Never know. Yeah, it's like that. It's like some sort of fucking espionage tool to spy on. You read that Charles Manson book.  I'm telling him. Oh, I know. That's what got me into conspiracy.  The U.S. Army is banned to talk from use on government phones, reversing its policy on the entertainment app, which it recently used as a recruiting tool to very clear what the fuck, man, what the fuck the army used.  Tick tock. They're doing like army dances.  They have their own video game to recruit people. Yeah, I know Army does. They had a reality show that a buddy of mine was filming. Oh, yeah. So but there was also it was there was another company that was saying that it was dangerous. You know, Google did something like that recently.  Here goes tick tock band tick tock trigger one was senators want it gone too.  Yeah. That's the senators want a band. Tick tock from government phones.  Tick tock for younger kids. Right. I'm not on there. Not anymore.  Well yeah, a lot of people are on it now. But the point is like if you have an app like that and say some shady person makes that app, who knows of that apps turn on the microphone.  I'm just listening to you all the time.  You know, dude, there's so many times where you'll talk about something and then you see that thing you talked about mentioned in your Google ads and you're like, what the hell, man, do not like this.  We'll talk about Portia's or those knives fans, the semi screenshots of like two housesitter podcast. Then I went to go search the web and I got this ad and it's like a Porsche or the knives or the whiskey or crazy. It's just way too much influence on us.  We have to, like, take back our our personal sovereignty, our mental sovereignty. There's so many influences on us all the time. And there's nothing wrong with them sometimes like advertising. There's nothing wrong with advertising sometimes. But sometimes it makes you think like, man, how much is this change in the way I look at stuff?  I think what's scary is how the most disciplined people I know who are addicted to their phones like, man, it's more addictive than any drug, any alcohol, any I mean, the cell phone, the most disciplined people I know. I see them on their cell phones like fucked. I know. It's so disappointing.  Guilty as charged. Me too. Yeah. I have an addict folder on my phone or my Twitter, my Instagram and my Instagram.  Reposting is all in one folder says addict, all capital letters.  And you still go to it, right? Still click on it once a day at least.  Yeah, way better than I used to be, but still every now and then.  But sometimes it's also it's the problem is too, that there's a mixture of business stuff that I have to do, like I get emails and have to respond to important things. But then while I'm on the phone, I'm like, let's see what's on you two do.  Let's see what silly videos there are back, what U.S. news is there. Click on Twitter. And that's where I get all my news. I click on it. Yeah. Yeah. And then you have a thought and you Google that thought and then you go down a rabbit hole like motherfucker, and then someone will send me something cool and I click on that. My God damn.  There's so much content. Right now has never, never been a time where there's think about what a better time it is entertainment wise, to be quarantined. I think we're counting the 90s. Oh, my God, you fucked. What do you know want back in those blockbuster days, you can't go blockbusters is closed? I think you do. You know, I was having a conversation with my wife about this last night, and she's like, I think theaters are done.  And I'm like I brought up to him just before this small potential, because there are lots of different companies that could do it, they could maybe open up to like maybe 50 people and you just separated by two chairs or something like that. Or you.  That's a movie theater, you mean? Yeah.  Yeah, I think they think movie theaters are done, too, in that Apple TV is open up the door during this quarantine to get new movies. Well, Charles, it's Friday.  My son's crunk as fuck for it, but they had a bunch of new movies that were supposed to come out in the movie.  James Bond got pushed back to November here.  So I don't think they should push them back. I think that's a mistake. I think they should release those bitches, make all their money. Listen, but still, everyone is watching now.  Everyone, if they come out with a bad ass James Bond film, we'd be all over it and everybody text their friend, do this fucking new James Bond movies.  This shit, Daniel Craig better be James Bond is James Bond.  And he, I think is the new DB. Listen, if you're going to have a female James Bond or whatever nonsense you're going to do that, go fuck out of my face. Please make it double 09. Yeah, blow a double seven sun.  Keep. Daniel Craig is the greatest James Bond of all time. Better than Sean Connery. He's the best. One hundred percent.  All of them can eat shit. All of them they can. All you shit. Roger Moore shit. No, no disrespect, sir. Sean Connery. Daniel Craig is the only one I believe I don't believe is really kicking anybody's ass. I believe Daniel Craig is fucking people up. I believe he's shooting people. He's the only one.  I believe the only one that means Pierce Brosnan. How dare you.  Wonderful man. That's wonderful, man. I don't know what's going on. The greatest game of all time. I don't believe him as he's an amazing actor. He's a beautiful man. I don't believe him as a murderous your English fucking spy character.  I believe Daniel Craig fucks people up. Come on, son. The guy on the right is the real deal. He's got to like a face that looks like he's been punched one hundred and fifty times. Right. He's a man's man.  I'll do the original far left. Come on, son. Eat some shit.  Lollipop. Eat it. Eat it.  There's one guy. Daniel Craig. Eat shit. Elba was going to be Bond.  I'll buy that. I buy that. Really. I don't care if bonds black it's. But he has to be a bad motherfucker and Idris Elba is a legitimate bad motherfucker.  I'm in. Have you ever heard who's the guy who does the Trevor knows bit on a black James Bond. No it's so fucking funny.  Why don't they have it be. Look, Trevor Noah talks about it. It's going to hide why he has a hole.  It's so fucking good. That's funny. Yeah. Daniel Craig is right now as of right now, he's the best ever. He's the only one, I believe. But I believe if they had a similar movie with Idris Elba, I believe that too. By that time, that guy's had a legit moiety fight. As a professional actor and a movie star, you a legit, mortifying trainee guy who was paid off to take a fall.  But, you know, I hear you. I like yeah, that's the rumor. Is that the rumor?  That's the rumor. Well, that's what I would say. I think the opponent came out, you know, they paid me to take a fall. Right.  But if that beautiful man beat my ass, I probably said that to me, too. Idris Elba, that looks too good.  So charming guy kicks your ass too embarrassing. You might have to tell people you took a fall down, believe you. You took a fall. First of all, if you say you took a fall, you might be even telling the truth. But you're the type of person that's willing to take a fall. So I can never believe.  Yeah, no, you're not that many people because people like Anthony Smith that won't win the world title versus John Jones by disqualification because they have character and then there's people who take dives. So if you're the type of people who takes a dive, how am I going to believe you anyway? Shit. How am I going to believe you anyway? I think Idris Elba fucked you up.  Probably. I think I think Scar fucked you up.  I think W8 fucked you like that. He said I think he fucked you up. But you don't like it do.  I don't think movie theaters are going to be dead because I think everyone likes the the experience of leaving the house. Right.  But they like Blockbuster too. It's great. You get to go out of the house, you pick whatever you want to do, a little flirty.  You know that you're not really going to watch the movie because it plan on Deep Dickin, right? Get those Redfin's you let them pick some stupid movie that you never know what's going on.  Reese Witherspoon is Legally Blonde too. Like, yeah, yeah, yeah. The dog's so cute.  Come on, let's get out of here. Are you thinking of the malling you're going to do. That's who you think I'll never forget. My mom's so wild I'll never forget when we get to the front like you have late fees of two hundred seventy five dollars.  Oh my gosh. Late fees were brutal.  My mom would be like, can we just listen, let's just get through this and then we'll be back next week and I will pay. And she would never pay.  Late fees were brutal, brutal, very brutal. Why don't we just keep the fucking movie? You know what else is brutal?  That's a little mom and pop little fucking ones that had the porno section there to kick open like the Outdoor Josey Wales.  Yeah, they had they had the the curtains, you know, the Outlaw Josey Wales when I was kick open those saloon doors.  Yes, that's. Joey Diaz is famous, one of the biggest references, he's always talking about kicking open saloon doors like the Outlaw Josey Wales, but they always had beads.  They always had sons. You remember those? I mean, you're you're a lot younger than me. How old are you now? Thirty seven.  Yeah, but there was a video store and I'll never forget this. How old were you when you looked at the porn section of the mom and pop video sneaking around 10 or 11, just a peek back there because they were velvet like crushed velvet. Maroon tried to open those beads and people would hear the click, click, click of your perverted and you shut your cough.  That's what it was saying. And to those beads are saying they were sending out a Morse code.  I'm jerking off and you're all like, pass each other like.  So no one would be friendly. No one would make eye contact. So we're just picking up boxes, looking at them like you're like you look like you're reading the plot on the bag.  So stupid. It was so stupid, man. It was so stupid, but also fantastic.  None of that now. So it was a weird time where, like, everybody knew that everybody else was porn, too. So we're all like, yeah, I don't like what's up.  And then, you know, maybe like if you have good friends, good friends would tell you that they beat off a lot of guys out there lying to each other.  Oh, I don't even like porn.  Stacks of it, kidney and shit and dude magazine magazines jerking off to magazines fro jacking off in the forest to magazines to just how I used to have a bit that I never wanna putting this on a special like I wrote it and I perform. But then like my special was too long. I think it was triggered one of the other ones.  But I had a whole bit about when I was a kid, we would find porn in the forest. There's some dudes who were so scared and so scared of the fact they beat off. They have to hide their shit in the woods.  Oh my God. If they go to the woods, should release that bit like a body to just redo it. I should just read and release it. Yeah.  Because I think the problem the problem was sometimes I get on a subject and I do too much on that subject.  I might have had too many jerking off jokes, jerking off joke. Yeah. To fucking. But you have to if you're doing a whole special and you have 20 minutes jerking off jokes, you got to edit out ten of that, put it aside, tighten, tighten up your ship.  But that's a thing like that back then, you know, it was it never existed before. So when I was a kid, when I was in high school, that's when the VHS tape became common in households in my neighborhood at least I don't remember what the year was.  They invented the VHS to VHS tape, but I remember the first time I ever saw TV on a thing that you could push into the television and watch it and play it.  And then people figured out that this is a good way to watch people fuck.  By the time I was a senior in high school, it went from freshman in high school. Nobody watched people fucked a senior high school. All of my friends were like stealing tapes from their dads and buying them off.  Other dude was was faces of death big when you were? Yes, I was. That was just after high school. Yes, just after high school. Dudes had faces of death.  And then there was also shit like Barnyard Betty where there was this this poor fetal alcohol syndrome baby that grew up to be a fucked up lady who was on drugs, is having sex with all these different barnyard animals. And you're like, oh, my God.  And so I was at my friend Billy's house and we went down to his basement watching the TV.  And our other friend Ron is guarding the door. He's making sure that he opens the door for parents. So he's got to he's like, look out at the door.  But watching this, chicks suck off a German shepherd.  Oh, my God, this is crazy because, you know, we were like twenty or something like that and we couldn't believe it to any twenty year old kid. If you said, you know, that there's ladies that if you pay him enough money to suck off dogs like what they'll feel like, but they'd be like, duh. Yeah, yeah. Here's a whole redit fucking sub thread. I know now a sub Reddit dedicated entirely to chicks who blow dogs.  A VCR was released in nineteen seventy seven in the United States. Faces of Death came out the next year and then in nineteen eighty five, a mathematics teacher.  Showed it to his class in Escondido High School. She fired two of the students were so traumatized by an unnatural fear of dying and suffering emotional distress. Yeah, yeah. I couldn't watch that when it was in high school.  The other thing was how much of it was real, though? It's a good question. I'd have to see it now. And some of it was. But most of what you saw, what you did to say the VHS was invented. Seventy six seven seven seven seven.  So I was in I was in ninth grade in nineteen eighty one. That was my first year as a high school student.  So that was like right when that was kind of kicking in, when, you know, when it was getting, you know, when a new invention like a thing that you can play tape and you can watch movies in your house that should take took a year or two back down.  Oh yeah. To spread across the country. Yeah. Betamax was the year and a half before it was VCR took off in Japan. Is this as Betamax came out in nineteen seventy five. Yeah. Yeah. Weren't the first.  I mean is VHS. Yeah VHS was inferior to Betamax but Betamax was a Sony product and it was, it was only Sony. So it was you had to only use their stuff. Right. And it apparently was way better and smaller.  They fucked up mini disk, you know, they fucked. They've had that problem a few times a year. Sony later won a few times Discman and like some other time.  Oh, but this one more stuff to try to remember them easier to was the first one. It was it would pop open on top. Yeah. You wouldn't put it straight in it pop up top and he put it.  But I remember when you go to the gym and dudes would have a disc man on their hip. Yes.  A big yellow plastic thing with a CD would sit in and they'd be at the gym lift in and be like how cool that guy looks like. He's got his own music.  They called the skip protection, ESP because it looked at and wouldn't forget.  And that was a big deal to skip and wouldn't skip.  You could shake it when Skip I remember when they first figured out how to do that in cars or like they nailed it because before if you were driving in your car and you hit a bump, your fucking music would ruin it, fucked the song one night.  It was a nightmare. It was basically you're driving around at a record player, but they did have a record player for a car. Even before that, they had record players for cars. And like the 50s, like a record. Like a seventy eight. Yeah. See if you can find that. We've talked about this before. Record players in cars. It was really old.  I want to say I'm terribly disappointed they didn't know what to do. There was some noise about being quarantine's.  Oh. Back then. Yeah. Well they, they basically were quarantined.  Yeah. That's what they're doing kind of life.  Was that living in the twenties, all the CDs you have, all the stuff that you'd have in the black case in the fall, you remember those things, you have those towers, you see these are stacked up.  You can buy one right now for one hundred fifty bucks. Oh my God. That's hilarious. I see.  That's way pricey for a record player, though. That works.  A Phillips record player for your car. But but what year did they invent it? Oh, look at that guy's car. Look at that lower. Look at that right there. Look at that black and white picture.  That guy's going to fucking fuck me. That's my that's Muhammad Ali. Holy fuck. Holy shit. He had a record player planers.  He's got stacks of records there, too. You know, the thing is, we don't know if that's Photoshopped. I know that's that's what's real weird, but here's what's real weird. In the future, you're going to be able to do like a regular person is going to be able to do whatever they want. What do you mean with it? With with CGI, with Photoshop? We'll do whatever pretending like. We don't know if like if you got one of those of Daniel Craig or John Lennon, John Lennon's drive around with a record player in his Cadillac.  I don't know if that's real today. Today, I don't know. But in the future, getting people to watch a video, we won't know if the video I've seen they've been originals could be on that easily.  Oh, easily. My place has been on so many chicks, Jimmy.  Chicks, like people have like taken my face and put on their body, especially when ridiculous like workout selfies to take.  Look like when I'm done working on all sweaty, I feel pumped people put them on chicks faces. Well have you seen like the deep fakes.  They do it with porno. They have like huge celebrities. Looks pretty fucking real man.  It looks pretty real. But here's the thing, man. CGI is going to replace all that. They're going to be able to do that with computer programs where you don't need to just put it on an existing video. You can do the whole thing artificially, the whole thing.  They'll probably it'll be like Squarespace, like Squarespace as templates for for website, the website.  They're going to have templates for porn. Like what do you want to do? You want to be a tennis instructor.  You want to do it and it's going to be a dude and then it's going to be he's going to just go in there and you're going to have whatever girl you want. You want to you want to fuck Meg Ryan. It's going to be Meg Ryan. That's not. Yeah, it's whoever you want.  You will probably get rid of the actor because they'll be able to put that in movies, whoever you want.  Yeah. You want a nineteen ninety Salma High.  Yeah. Oh.  So you, you get to hear her voice, you get to see her face like there's going to be pretty crazy lawsuits where people are trying to stop people from using their face and their artificial body in porn. And the arguments are going to be that it's art. You're going to you can't stop freedom of expression of people's name and likeness.  Yeah, but it's not if it's a painting of someone, here's the thing, right?  If I take you and I paint you, can I sell it?  This is what I tell you. Yes, I think so. I think if someone paints me and they sell it, I don't have any say in that that I'm a public figure. The painting, I mean, they're selling it now. What do they paint me? It's so realistic that it looks exactly like me. And I've got a dick in my mouth and they're selling it.  You can't I don't think I can do anything. So let's keep going. Let's keep going. What if instead of paint, they do a digital photograph so they make a photograph with the computer of me? It looks just like me doing something I've never done before. Robbing a bank like running out of there with a bag of cash and a pistol in my hand thing that never existed. It's not a pre-existing photograph where they just superimposed my face. It's a completely new image.  How is that not a piece of art? I think it is.  So why wouldn't it be like especially it's going to be disturbing for female celebrities.  What if it's you in a in a KKK outfit? Could be you and anything. It could be you with a giant vagina given birth with Bill Clinton. But that was a real painting. It was a painting.  And if you don't know how crazy this Eppstein story is and Jeffrey Epstein's house in New York City, which was seventy million dollars worth. Seventy million dollars not to do that. Someone gave him somebody gave it to him.  OK, whatever. I have friends. I get it. He's got a painting of Bill Clinton in a dress pointing at him. It's Hillary Clinton's dress.  Well, whoever's dress it is, it's Bill Clinton might have been Monica Lewinsky's dress. Is it the same one that Hillary won?  It could be pretty close. So we're talk to the painter. He's way, but that was in his living room. It's so weird. So in his living room, he had a painting of Bill Clinton dressed up like a woman.  I think he had that George Bush one to. Have you seen that music playing with little.  It's almost like they held stuff over these guys to the point where they could humiliate them, mocking them.  So if that guy came in, like if Bill came over to his house, you would see that he would see, like, you're my bitch, you're my bitch.  I don't care if you're the former president. You're my bitch.  I still don't think he will show you the videos. I still don't think he committed suicide. Of course you don't, because he didn't. Yeah. First of all. And that's not.  What do you think, Jeremy? I'm not like a big conspiracy. Michael Baden, that fucking guy from that HBO autopsy autopsy series. Yeah. He talks about it in depth. He's like, no, these are injuries consistent with someone who's been choked to it.  It's also the position of the cut. It's all lower. Like when you hang yourself, it goes up like that.  Oh, wait, this is down there, right? Someone's choking this motherfucker off. Hey, I think everyone sees the next to go is too much shit. Yeah, we talked about this yesterday, right tonight with Michael Shermer, who don't talk about this with LEKS or was it Michael?  It came up when he said, I don't know, I've heard that argument before, but I think that he's got more to lose than he does to gain, because if he says something like all those Hollywood starlets, they'll suck my dick.  And that's how they got famous.  It sort of reinforces that he was a monster, that he was a monster, but also shows they are playing the game.  They were playing the game. But that game's illegal. And so the whole reason why he's in jail for the rest of his life is because that game's legal. But he's already in there.  So if he goes, hey, I'm getting this monster like this celebrity, she did this with me for years.  This Jeffrey Epstein's Hollywood pipeline ran straight to Harvey Weinstein.  Well, I would make up a bunch of stories about aliens now that Harvey is in the pokey for the rest of his life.  If I ran some of them dubious websites all day, I was terrified of shit.  I would start writing the most ridiculous stories.  I am related to someone who propositioned by Harvey Weinstein, said he could, uh, make her a star. Yeah, she didn't. She didn't believe him.  The crazy thing is he sounds like your cousin was a dumb ass. He know it was in Ohio. She had no idea who it was. Oh, I just, like, do your research girl.  Was there no Google back in this fucking. It might have been shit. She could have been fucking Wonderwoman.  She's like, who's this fat guy? Are you insinuating. Oh, no. How dare you. Back in the day, Wonder Woman who made people famous, Whitney Cummings talks about it.  She has a really funny way of putting it.  She's like, well, I always told the truth. He did. He really did it for him. Like, if you told me, suck my dick, I gonna put you in this movie there in the movie or in the movie. And that was his reputation, like, wow, crazy.  But then again, how does a guy like him? Ever fucking 10 by one of my movies, I put them in movies and you imagine how stunned he must have been, like with Imagineer bang in like some of the most famous hottest women in the world. And you're this monster.  You look terrible. You look terrible. You look like an experiment. Right?  He was so vile. Doesn't have Corona.  Pretty sure they moved in the Corona thing. Dave Chappelle had a fucking hilarious take on that.  He was very few dudes.  We look at him and go, oh, yeah, he rapes her. Oh, that was in that belly room comedy special that he did was Walker got so crazy.  He's so foul looking, but. If a guy like him, like, grew up in that Hollywood system, that's probably he's probably. You know, like a really extreme version of how they all did it. Yeah, he's not the first one.  Know that cat did the casting couch. Is an expression for a reason. Correct, it was real. It's a huge porno channel to this day. I mean, butt in, but we know that that happened, right?  It's yeah, it's gross. 100 percent. I'm not and I'm not endorsing it.  I'm just saying we know of it as a historical reality. You know, just like we know barbarians used to be real.  We know you know that as a historical reality, the casting couch was a real thing, godey's, vile.  But he's got everything. He's got pockmarks, he's fat, he's balding, nothing is gross. Look. And he doesn't look compassionate, doesn't look friendly.  It's all those things apparently in a small dick.  But it's also it's like this is like a fucking vortex of things that are happening. Everything's all happening together.  And this guy figured out that it's a system if you get people attention and make him famous and you can make a lot of money if you make good choices and you're smart about how you do it and you control your addiction just enough to keep making movies when he's.  With a bunch of young starlets and he just looks like, yeah, complete shit, just monster Drori.  What do you do if you're one of those gals I want to be in the movie, I could be Aqua one man's girlfriend.  Oh, just suck this guy's tech shit.  Didn't you have a bit about it? Yeah, well, I had a bit about my son.  I said definitely.  But if I was if I was a man, like it was me and it was my daughter, you know, like every man in this room, like every person's room.  And that guy propositioned my daughter and offered her money in exchange or offered her sex her giving him sex to be Catwoman's for a movie. I'd be like, no, I'd want to kick his ass. I want to fuck him on a him. I forgot the bit.  But what breaking news like know some fighters out like this. I like when I get there. Tweet. Sorry, I'm nervous. Yeah. Sorry. The fight off. Yeah. The suspense I was trying to get.  What do you got here. You see two for now has been canceled, all UFC events postponed indefinitely due to covid-19.  Dana White says he's ready to promote the event, but things were taken out of his control. Much, much more to come. The government stepped in. You ain't doing a show. Wow, wow, that's interesting. That's interesting, that's interesting. Well, that saves me a lot of fucking thinking. Oh damn.  I was 75 percent ready to go. You were going to do it. The only thing that worried me is that if I contracted something and then I came in contact with other people, so what I was going to do is do it if I definitely could get tested. And then I would have to know the results before I come back, but fuck, and even then, you don't know if their testing was a little dicey like it.  Some people saying there's a new type of test that they're working on, which is that they don't have it officially done yet, I guess. But when I was reading the stuff about the NBA, it said that they have a potential, like, instant test.  Right. Like maybe a diabetic type test where you can pick a finger, get a little blood and they can get something within five to ten minutes. I believe that also said it was hypothetical. And like, if they can get that done or get it mass produced or whatever it is, you know, and it works and it's accurate, then they will proceed.  But I'm so disappointed.  Do this an article in The Atlantic about tracking you with cell phones and tracking you in comparison to trusted people that have tested negative like that, that that could be the way that we could release people from quarantine.  And this is we're going to go full Eddie Bravo on something like this, because if you have to have something, you have to have your phone on you to travel, like apparently they have to do.  And I think it's in China right now. They have their phone to travel and they have a health app on their phone.  It's sort of like they have to keep their health app up to date.  There's one on every iPhone already.  Yeah, but I think this is a different kind of it's not you know, it's a different kind of thing that, like, you have to have like you have to been certified that you tested clean for covid and then it's on your phone or certificate, right?  Yeah, something like that. I'm fine with that. And that to you can't be because then they can restrict your travel just based on whether if you're sick though. But yeah, but here's the thing. We've always just accepted that people can be sick and we prefer freedom over one hundred percent safety.  We've always accepted that we're not doing that now. But my point is we've always accepted that. And if we decide to keep going further down that rabbit hole where we make someone carry a device where you can track their location, you have to have a travel scary.  It gets weird, man. It gets weird. You have telephone. And I have to be able to see what you've been up to, what have you been partying all night.  And you go to the airport and like, I think you have cancer. Like, no, no, no.  I just had coke in your vehicle. Like, I think you're dying like, no, I just been I've been have I haven't gone to bed yet. I've got high blood pressure. I'll go back to see my family at Denny's. I just I'm trying to go home. I want to go home, sleep for three days. Yeah. And they're like, you're sick. I need to quarantine you.  But this that's a poor example just for humor. But there's a slippery road.  If you tell people they have to have a phone everywhere they go right now, you don't you could have a driver's license and or a passport and you can get on a plane and you're fine. You don't have to have a phone. You don't have to have a phone right now. And I'm not saying you shouldn't have a phone, but I'm saying if someone's going to tell you that you have to have a phone everywhere you go, things are going to get slippery.  But what that going to be able to track you? One hundred percent.  But what if it's just like the way you scan your boarding pass? What if you scan to make sure you're healthy?  But that's the problem, is this kind of stuff that they don't track you?  Well, look, think about all Google has done is not a knock on Google, but all Google has done with basically just the information that they give to companies and what your activities are. Right.  There's a reason why when you're talking about things in these Google ads pop up, why is that? Why when you look up something, you find those ads in every way because they're trying to tell you things, right? They're trying to figure out they're modern.  What you're looking at. Yeah. Yeah. Trying to figure out what makes you tick.  Why wouldn't they do that with this, too? Why wouldn't you do that with this too? Well, I wouldn't like if they if you track people if you could track who's going to pay for all that software and all that stuff. OK, well we'll just put a few ads up.  Would you rather be content imagine much rather be content, but imagine if you could track people, if they could go everywhere and while while they're doing their, you know, everything they do, you know, they went to this grocery store, you know, they went to this house, you check app on them that they can't leave behind the checks.  Their health is dicey.  It's dicey. It's. There should never be a group that has more power over an individual rather than another individual.  It's not like the thing about having a massive group that can tell one person that they can or can't do something is it can be abused.  If everyone is even it can never be abused.  If we all follow the same rules and the same laws, then, OK, we all agree. We all have the same amount of control and power over each other's lives. But as soon as you have more control than the person who you're monitoring, then things can get weird.  It's just natural. People are weird. They control people. They like controlling people. They like abusing power. A lot of people that have power, abuse, power.  So if you give the power of constant surveillance in exchange for the freedom to be able to go everywhere you want and the relieving of quarantine, we just want to know you're healthy. No big deal like. OK, yeah. We'll let you check if you let us monitor to you. That's what's going on.  It's not that they thought this through and this was their end goal. You don't think so? I don't think it's a fucking conspiracy. No, I think people take advantage of things that happen.  Correct. That's more likely. What's more likely is a crazy thing happens and people automatically take advantage when they find an opportunity, especially the more predatory amongst us.  So it's not like we're we're just looking out for human nature. It's human nature to you. When you look at the stuff that Edward Snowden found out about the NSA, like, of course they would if they could, they're going to do it.  They're going to find a way. It's human nature. It's just how we are.  Man, dude, I want to know who shut down.  You'll see two forty nine because we know how adamant days more I got waiting to get that in there.  Supposed to happen April 18th has been canceled. Dana White confirmed. Oh wow.  That he was asked to stand down by top Disney ESPN executives and he is doing so damn thinking the power at Disney. Hey, Dana, let's shut it down.  Well, I think they made probably a risk assessment and then they made a calculation about the negative aspects of going against government regulations in terms of like state government would be.  They probably can't do this. They're saying it's not worth the cost. Imagine being the president of the UFC. Fuck all that. Imagine having all these fights that you have to make and having all this pressure on you.  And you're also like a famous guy like Dana is. Imagine being that guy. Fuck that job.  Dana. President, the UFC is second only to president of the United States.  You fucking how did the pressure dude throw his ridiculous million dollars in the bank account?  That's nice.  But you get used to that. You get used to help. You do you do. He's compensated well for it. He's compensated well. I'm not making all the fights.  He's making a lot of fights. He's making the main fights. He's making the main event.  But the most important thing is he's like a psychotic driving force for the most exciting organization in the world. And I don't think the organization gets where it is without Dana White. I think you have to have a crazy person at the wheel.  I think you have to build on the other guy in the park. He's a real man. He doesn't give a fuck. He'll talk shit. Yeah, he'll insult. People will go back with you. He's nuts. And then Disney went, Yeah, you're a wild boy.  It's like I'm going to an Indian reservation. I'm gonna die. Let he's get a fucking.  Then Disney went very cool. Your island. Yeah. I hope you didn't put money down because we're shutting all that down there. Like what?  What are we doing here? And then they're probably just the only thing that's up and running like this. This is up and running. They're ready to go right now.  And I think I wish they would have let them go because everyone has been just fucking fine. But it's 750 million dollars.  As long as the right precautions are in place. I agree it would have been fine. But the thing is, it's like you got to measure get this, if this was like just an any other disease where we understood it better.  I would be way more confident we understand numbers, though, we do, but we don't understand. Michael Yo, Michael Yo almost died and you know what Michael Yo is doing right now?  He's fine. Right, but he almost died, but he did it, but he was in the hospital for a week. He's fine, OK.  OK, now I don't want people who are less, like, robust. Then Michael Yo to die, so we've got to figure out, like, what the fuck this virus is, how does it get treated? What's the most effective way? When can we. And then then then it makes sense that we're a little bit more loose with our regulations.  100 percent now. Now, Michael Yo, decent shape. He is in D shape compared to a UFC fighter. He's fucking Adell. You know, I'm saying like he's on shape compared to Tony. He works out a lot. He really does. Again, compared to Tony Ferguson. You're fine. You're right.  But he's also not that old. No. And is he, you know, college football player, strong, too loose term. Yes.  I understand what he did. He was a ball. He was involved at the very least.  Do you have funny is it when people get busted with, like, a fake story of, like some sort of athletic past?  Oh, dude is the weirdest thing. Brian had this friend. I know. That's why I brought it out. Oh, my God. You're like, I can't go in the beach and I've trained with you.  I can't go. I know I can go. I have to check cameras. I'm no fan of the beach. I told Brian, Dude, I'm telling you, that guy's full of shit. Brian, I'm telling you, we can track all of this.  Yeah, dude, I had a guy who made me talk to his friend because his friend knocked out Chuck Liddell, one of the early UFC. And this guy is insisting that he knocked out Chuck Liddell and one of the early UFC and he insists that I know he's like, my friend needs to talk to you.  It's like a guy was like he was like a bouncer at a nightclub. And he made me talk to his friend.  And I'm like, What are you talking about? I go. I go. He's had one loss. Was it Jeremy Horn? You got submitted by Jeremy Horn. Is that the time, Mikey? You didn't knock him out?  No, it's in check. I can check right now. But that didn't happen. Never happened. That didn't happen. That wasn't a real thing. The best was Brian was defense.  Remedios did he wrestled the issue. Oh, my coach wrestled the issue. He was. How old is your guy use? He's like forty something.  Oh, my coach. Well, they've been the same, you know, I'll see him tomorrow. Let me ask him.  He was that guy the Broncos do Brennan's coach. Was that issue when you said you were there? Eagles did I say I was on the team? I'd go in and volunteer. What do you want? Programs. Don't let people volunteer to work out with the with the wrestling team. Yeah, we got a farmer.  Once you come in and do back flips, the TV and the gymnastics team. Man, what does that mean? I volunteered.  Who volunteers finally got Brian to admit it. People are crazy. People make stuff up. It's too easy to track these days, 80, 90. This guy and he had this dude take him to the woods where he's going to fuck, he's going to fight in the committee.  Fuck.  And the guy has a fucking big ol sack with him like a big old bag that you would carry with you. Like a big one, like a three foot bag, solid bag.  And it goes, yeah, he goes, I'll be back in two days, you know, and hopefully I'll win this thing.  And he goes into the woods, drops him off and he goes to the woods. And so then he comes back, his friend comes to get him to agree upon this time. Two days later, his friend comes back and he's holding a trophy.  He doesn't have the bag anymore, so the bag, the trophy is in the bag in this case, this guy came out of the woods holding those trophies, saying that he won this in this committee. And the guy's like, that's the same size as the bag. Yeah. And you have the bag anyway. What the fuck are you doing?  So this dude basically just went camping and decided that would be the thing. He's going to tell everybody, find some notorious karate tournament in the forest.  So I had to appreciate the hustle. Oh, my God. It's such a funny story to tell you.  So what do you guys had to dropped me off on this dirt road?  I have to fight in a karate tournament. So friends are like, wow, this is just like a movie. It just goes walking down a dirt road like it's fucking quite changing.  Oh, my God, it's so stupid, it's so stupid. See the magic thing and I got these motherfuckers. Do you have any questions?  Night to night, my soul just goes back. It's probably like hit himself. A couple of things got dicey, but I pulled it off.  It got crazy in the first fight. But the next eight fights for me.  And for what?  It's just a trophy. It's no rules committee of the forest. The anything you could do like that in the forest is more you do on an island.  That's what have been cool about this UFC thing. If it really did go to Fuck Island, not anymore. Well, I give it a couple of weeks.  Yeah. May they'll be back up and running. Well, the good news is it's pure our response to this because it happened in the moment.  The island might still be in play because all the other leagues are still figuring out that like remote situation to fix soccer, baseball, basketball.  So they might well, if you could control an island, if it's a small island, if you could control the whole island, test everybody, why not?  How much money is the UFC and be spending on these private jets? How much money are they going to be making with the reality show about moving the UFC to the island? Because I'm watching that shit fuck Tiger King, I watch and Dana White with his crazy screaming and running around trying to figure out where to put all these fucking fights, trying to figure out how to get a fight to an island, and coming up with an idea of an island in international waters and who owns the island.  That's what I do, is the king of the island. One episode, this, this, and then the government wants to do him on the phone call. Yes, Mr. Trump, I understand Mr. Trump, Disney calling him up, yelling at him.  He's a wild man. While I don't know what they're going to do. But can we told you I have to throw those forty some flights?  I think they're going to relax a little. I think people are going to hopefully realize that the worst is behind us. I think maybe they'll be like this. I'm hoping I'm hoping they this obviously I'm hoping the current treatment is the one that works. But if that's not the one that works, maybe they find something just as good. I heard Zenk people. Oh, that was the other thing. Why are people saying tonic water?  Why are people saying this is one of the weird things about home remedies and homeopathic cures to ruthless pandemics?  But people are saying quien nine in tonic water and zinc together are a good combination.  That someone was saying that it's somehow or another mimics what that.  That malaria drug does sounds. I owe Tamaqua what is looking up tonic water, Wikipedias says tonic water is a carbonated drink in which quinine is dissolved, originally used as a prophylactic against malaria tonic water. Whoa, usually now has a significantly lower quinine content is consumed for its distinctive bitter flavor. So now it's just a taste.  Oh, OK. So originally, see, that's what happens to home remedies. But but if you can get quiet night, forget about tonic water. If you actually quinine mimics that malarial drug again, this is probably when they first made it back when Coke had Coke in it.  This is how those people died. Drinking pool cleaner air funkin. That's that's how the dude died. That dude is like, look, it's the same letters, the same letters fucking it's probably prescription only.  It says quinine is medication for malaria. So I don't but I don't think you could just get that.  But there is a certain amount of quinine from a natural source and tonic water like what is the quinine from? Why do they have it in their. Imagine if that was the drink they drank and places the mosquitoes were bad by name, powder is so bitter that British officials stationed in early century, 19th century India had to mix it with soda and sugar so they could drink it well.  So that's probably how they made the drink to begin with. That's deep. They made it drink with some nasty stuff that kills malaria.  Do you know that sickle cell and sickle cell anemia is closely related to people that have survived malaria? Really?  Yeah, apparently it's like the genetic Tiffany Haddish is actually the first person to tell me this.  The genetic the reason why sickle cell came about was because of an ability to fight off malaria somehow or another connected and that.  What's up? I'm sorry. No, but that and then I looked it up and it's like it's really interesting. It's like it occurs in people who are descendants of people who were in places where malaria existed. So it has something to do with this resistance to malaria.  Have you had Tiffany on here? No, I haven't. She was supposed to be on, but she got sick.  There is also it says at the bottom of the hour, though, why is is I don't know, prescribed, but it says it's often recommended to relieve leg cramps, huh?  By leg cramps. Yeah. Like cramps are no different than arm cramps, are they? It says. But the FDA cautions consumers against using off label quietening drugs to treat leg cramps, but making a certain amount of it that can be mixed.  Where what kind of a bitch are you that you need to take a drug for a leg cramp? That is about walk it, stretch it out, stretch it out, do have some water.  Come on, drink something with electrolytes.  Get yourself some liquid I.V. Maybe this is like supercharged electrolytes. I don't know how much science about it at all. Just is like a sentence. Yeah.  Who knows man. I hope it works. If it doesn't work, I hope the vitamin C sauna. That's what I'm doing. A lot of vitamin C, vitamin D so bad. I bet you do. It's three hours and twenty seven hours. Twenty. Oh damn. It's three thirty almost.  I think we got a lot accomplished. I mean, to fucking.  Then how about the fact that it happens? Why we're on the podcast. That was pretty crazy when you cover too much of it.  Listen, man, I was hesitant. My my thoughts. I know you were I was like, I really want to go.  Like, I was leaning towards going, but I'm like, I don't want to hear it from people that don't think it's a good idea.  You know, I'm not interested in putting myself at risk, but my real concern was how do I know if I contract it and then I bring it back? How am I going to know? And I had to be honest with myself, like, I really wouldn't know.  So the only way I would be able to do it is to do it and then be in quarantine until I get tested. That it worth it.  I'm like, oh, Jesus Christ, what I want to find out, man.  I want to find out how many people have it.  I would I wish they would do one thing that I wish they would offer is like a worldwide antibody test. Let's find out what the real numbers are and maybe they're already doing this. I'm just a moron, but a worldwide wide more, right? Yeah.  What's weird to me is the NBA got tested so fast that I mean antibodies.  I want to find out, like how many people went through it. It'd be nice to have a test, be nice to have a test. The people that survived it, like, let's test you. How many people survived it?  Amazing. They have those numbers.  Yeah, they do. Be nice to have that, but be also nice. I hate to say this because I don't want to test everybody, but if we tested everybody, everybody, it was real simple.  We tested everybody and then we find out again, this is a power thing. You don't want people having the power to fuck and just force you to take a test. And that's what ultimately they would have to do. If we're going to test everybody, you'd have to make it like the government would have to make it mandatory. But imagine if they tested everybody be like, dude, we got like 99 percent.  People have had it and they didn't even know. And they're fine.  We don't know what it's like. 99 percent of the planet had it in.  A few of them got really bad and people died from other people just maintained and didn't even skip a beat.  There'd be no quarantine. We heard no like chicken pox. Like almost everybody gets the chicken pox eventually. That's true. Is that true? You can get it again. They have a vaccine for the chicken pox.  So I thought you can only get one.  Well, the thing to have a vaccine for, like chicken pox, when a kid gets it done, a lot of parents feel like they want to get their kid near it. Yeah, but that was before they had vaccines, I think.  See, if I mean, I'm really sure they have a vaccine for the chicken pox. And that was the idea behind it. That's why people would want their kids.  We would hear about chicken pox and aggressive. Yeah. When I was a kid, I had it, I'm pretty sure. But you can't get it twice. You can't get it twice.  Once you have it. You're good.  I have like a little hole in my face. It just my scab.  There is one here. Varicella it's called. Yeah. Oh, varicella. Thank Jamie. You're talking about back before then.  They used to do that. Yeah. You people would bring their kids or someone had chicken pox. You bring your kid over around that kid, you develop the antibodies. You know, that's the other thing about diseases.  It's like think about the flu. How many times have you had the flu but your friend didn't. And there were you around them.  How many times have like someone in your house, like your wife, have the flu and you go, you don't have it or you do and she doesn't get it.  Like, what is the difference between someone who gets it and someone who doesn't? It's not just contact. It's also like how well your body fights off that flu, your immune system.  Yeah. And that's something I think it's going to help all of us to concentrate on now. You know, I really, really, really, really hope that that's what people get out of this.  This is the fucking kick in the ass you needed to get your life in order for your health, get your fucking immune system in order, get that workout program and bitch do something, do something and do something.  Do something.  Skip rope. Just skip rope. Do you think you're a bad mother fucker skips from rough for 10 minutes every day? You'd be shocked at how hard it is to skip rope for ten minutes.  It's so good for you. So good for you. So simple. Good for footwork. Someone was talking about that at some football player.  I forget what the story was, but he was talking to this other football players kid or this other guy's kid who wanted to play football.  And he's like, do skip rope. He's like, no, why don't you skip rope? Like, that was the first thing that he said to him.  I was like, I don't I don't know, four receivers and quarterback or quarterback for football, period. That's great. I think it's great. Like there's a reason why people do it for striking, too.  When you're forced to bounce up and down on your ball, your feet like that, you get a way better sense of what your body's capabilities in terms of move.  When I was five extra rounds inside the cage, I do four or five minute rounds with a minute off of jump rope and I'd go in the ring and bounce back and forth, do jump ropes the shit I love jump rope.  Think just think about how you're doing. Like these little explosions over and over and over again. Over and over again. Good. And mix it. Oh my God. Speed. And you've developed these legs that can explode all the time.  But thanks for your footwork. You're always on it. Yes. Yes. And then you get that on it.  That thick dick jump rope, that fucking rattlesnake jump, that shit works your shoulders, but it's just such an underrated exercise.  There's so many simple to I know that's one of the cool things. There's there's some positives to this quarantine for some folks. And one of those is you have the time to look at stuff more. And that's one thing that maybe was like just sitting there and people like I never thought about that for fitness, but. But you're willing to go to take a soul cycle class on the other side of town? You were, but you could just watch a YouTube video and jump rope and get away harder work out and way more calories.  And it's hard.  You have to go anywhere. You can watch a watch a movie, watch your favorite movie, watch The Godfather.  I used to go to my garage every morning, read that peloton. I got a fucking bike now because the quarantine. What do you say? I'm part of the fun of those classes.  Joe is not just being biased and I'm not them talking about them hot rods and cycling hoes, but I don't want to piss your pants.  Thanks to.
