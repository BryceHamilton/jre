Pro boxer Roy Jones Jr. captured championships in numerous weight divisions, at one time holding a record-breaking seven heavyweight belts simultaneously. In 2003, Jones made history by becoming the first middleweight champion to win a heavyweight title in 106 years. Jones officially retired from the sport in 2017, but signed on earlier this year to fight Mike Tyson in an highly anticipated exhibition bout.
