chapter and that's how I feel too it's going to be about how talking to women about how to raise functional Sons this isn't this is needed in America and I'm going to step up and do it because all these Tales what with all the news and such obvious it's obvious to me these women I have not raise their sons correctly and I'm going to correct them cuz I'm tired of them yapping and fucking bitch in the morning I'm old I'm going to tell you what to do to raise decent Sons women will your son said something they were doing a little tour of the studio they saw the picture of Rosa Parks and your son said that's Rosa Parks and I said you are the few people that ever just pointed that out and noticed it and he goes to court she goes Rosa my mom she raised me right in that sweet that's what do you call it what did they call what I don't know what does vernacular I don't know they did a great job shout out shout-out shout out to Mom's how you holding up everything good with you right now was it will you smoking before all this happened to secretly you son of a bitch every time I see Doug I'd smoke one that sounds good he's got an evil spell on me a little man he's sober right now no cigarettes for him either he always says no he's doing sober October are y'all doing supper October get fucked up October street ox that's my boyfriend John and calls it how many cigarettes you smoke a day no well no but who's counting you just keep walking them smoking less than 10 less than signs my bad okay so so next week it'll be down to one. If anyone dies this whole thing has been completely fucking insane and you realize this madness is outrage culture right at the peak I think you you hit Peak outrage culture will people didn't give a fuck if you were making a joke you didn't give a fuck if you had no idea that that lady was black didn't give a fuck what your mental state was didn't give a fuck if you were on Ambien didn't give a fuck if you were drinking didn't give a fuck if you work sincerely apologized apparently they do but they didn't care that you you sincerely apologized and did not didn't mean to offend you were cracking a joke about a woman it was funny how they've mischaracterize it and lied about it and added words to it all the guys to all whom I inadvertently offended and because they were offended for like it wasn't even what they say they were offended cuz it didn't say they think that I tweeze a said she looked like you know somebody I never said anything about it was a political tweet and it's just proof of how everybody's under Mass mind control because they took a and of course I'm always interested in that you know you know that I've dumbass my control I think a lot of it self-imposed that's what I think I think people are under the wave of self-imposed my control I don't think it's like there's anybody pulling the strings can get out of it I don't think anyone I think one of the reasons why I attacked the attack Someone Like You It's first of all you're wealthy and successful and famous you are beautiful and one of the best comics of all time and you're also your you're an easy target you're a white woman and as a Jew no they go and this is what you thought this woman was as well she looks just like my cousin but it wasn't nothing to do with how she looks that came after my tweet but the boss said about her hands what she engineer dinner on and I've been on there talking about the women's revolution in Iran for years and speaking to people in Iran about it and what it means to the women who are second-class citizens and so if you take that one tweet out of like probably I tweet a lot of trouble I admit it I mean what the fuck they're like you know what you said you're crazy for years and you know what you're crazy well yeah I said it for years all Comics are fucking not so I don't wash my keys like some I know some guys are they got to wash your keys five six seven times for that go on stage what's his name oh I'm so bad on names Chris Farley I always ask, you know I asked him what's what's your secret number what's yours Joe you have to do something a number X you don't have a number what's your birthday 11 67 what's the largest 11 67 you were born in 1967 Jesus F Christ I was in there I was in the Utah State Hospital when you were born rosacea it lasted for 9 months and it was the Utah State Hospital in Provo where the Osmonds are from is always a big Marie Osmond fan the mental health aspect of this conversation is it important one because here's my take on this it is important and yes it was mental health awareness day yesterday as I was smoking if someone has someone has an injured leg you don't expect them to run marathons if someone has Assad you know something wrong with their liver you don't expect them to process food correctly you don't blame it on them but if someone has a mental health issue and they do something erratic or they say something that's inappropriate and then the apologize for it and you you had the jitomate real diagnosed treated mental health issues trauma-related issues they go like a little better but for whatever reason people want to pretend that this is a deliberate Act buy a calculating person who is just being an asshole and that's not the case you're not an ass off that's not what you were doing now but I was talking about Iran in the women's Revolution there and how how and it's always been because you know what I had my DNA done cuz I wanted to know and I am of North African ancestry how much it's like a very small percentage but it was something like 25,000 years ago they left North Africa which is kind of Syria and they went to Lithuania and Russia and some you're up do you like 23andMe or something just answered so many questions for you know why I feel this year earnings Wars that part of the world it but I do you know and I should be geopolitics there are some in it always intrigued me and I have always attempted to use my voice to you no support all all the people there well it's a fast this one tweet was like about it was about I mean it's actually a genius tweet if you really fucking me what did you say Jamie I'll tell you if it's the artificially rendered distorted what year was just Grace comic Roseanne and her racist tweet and then after that it was disgraceful, can her offencive racist Street cuz there's all these hoops you got to jump through you know they're never done punishing you well we're saying before the contest started apologize to social justice Warrior Cats witches of death that's fucking jump in the water blood in the water in them a little bit of that but what I what I was saying before the podcast to use I I don't I don't really what I really think happens is they find a Target and they don't care if it's a viable Target the ones that are you get greenlit they go after you until some new target comes along until some new distraction National outrage they find in the attack you and they go after you and they try to distort your and obviously they don't that's what kind of cracks me up so I can look at this look what they're saying it meant and you know I'm not going to bow down before them and say you were right and they want me to but they weren't right I'm right I wrote it bitch so I know what I meant so you don't forget to tell me what I meant but they don't care that's not Ashley and say oh here's a woman that has a history of mental health problems shoes on and being and drinking and she says something that is slightly irrational but given your explanation of it will you just telling you what she was black. Both always think all my tweets make no sense you've been saying that for fucking here since I went on Twitter you're like to her tweets are just putting straight-up crazy crazy tweets for sure I don't think they're crazy you just don't get them well maybe if I was in the same mindset as you I would get them I think I know I think like other people I know that I've always known that my whole life I always test other people see what they were thinking like as even as a kid I feel like I try to fit in a let's play Barbies you know and I'm like I'm like okay well but let's have Barbie be a resistance fighter that pair of troops and you know to the hidden lines of the German thing and save all the Jews and they don't you have to be her cousin skipper then they had me the Skipper doll I always had to personify Skipper and they got to be presented that always had very large pendulous breasts in size I did I don't I don't think we're look like other people I've him an alien really well somebody told me about that barbell show they would always say that round faces are from PA seeing you got a round face that's what I told you. I have to admit that's how I classify people I like last five people my own way cuz I don't think like everybody else thinks I take a person shape of their head not the group they represent to me and I have noticed that the Dutch have the largest head the Dutch sure Square not all of them but some of them do the average height for a Dutch person like 6 ft tall because they all have a variety of foods that I enjoy so I like to you know I don't just mix with one kind of person in my real life I mix with all kind of people and you know cuz I'll go anywhere for a free meal but I love I love cultures and I love all people that's all I want to say you know I'm not that person so I know you're not a racist by any stretch of the imagination but you are a person that I can make fun of anything but most comedians that we're all like that right intentions or will you definitely have to talk and make them it's part of my job description. Mark and make fun of you look for things that are irritating about everything that's part of the job she want you back by the reason why the show became such a giant hit and its return I mean it was a fucking huge hit coming right out of the gate number one every episode that's a lot of people and a lot of that was because people love this aspect of you but as soon as you get labeled a racist everybody throws her hands up and goes well I didn't know she was racist she's racist they don't care about Nuance they don't care about the details was the first thing I want thing I've learned out with Jeff take an Ambien don't not do not drink a beer always only drink a wine have a good friend of mine who is one of the nicest most respectful guys you ever want to meet he woke up in Germany on a plane covered in his own vomit with the police standing over him asking him if he knew what happened he getting arrested they brought to the jail in Germany and they out in a CEO of a large company and they went over things with Sam Nate said what happened what do you remember it goes well I remember taking an Ambien and then then I went to sleep then I had I guess I had a beer at some point in time I'm going to go okay stop this is what happened and so they describe how he was hitting on the stewardesses and trying to start fights with men in the cabinets we walked all over himself he's the nicest guy if you knew this guy you would never in a million years believe it was capable of anything remotely like this and the German people actually let him stay in the country they let him continue his vacation feel like okay for gave him promise not to do that again and one of the things that I said to you when I called you up I said what were you doing well in Utah call me you are an Ambien and I said okay we'll stop right there because I know quite a bit about that cuz I've had personal experiences with friends that have had real issues with Ambien I had a bit I did in my ass but a friend of mine who literally made a meal Mars on Ambien he was on that and then some check you know I don't understand what people said they have sex on Ambien people say that's a big thing that people take Ambien to have sex I don't even know how they can stay. They don't stay awake but another part of them wakes up and their sex part comes out that's all I can figure never had a problem found is THC they sell it down at the dispensary and there's one for sleep at night and I'm I've been doing that and I I've been sleeping through the night of when I was taking the sleeping thing to sleep and Drug while I don't want to say it cuz we don't want to get sick you don't get sued not me they said did you see that cast who is it a drug expert and he will be right swerve ice and does a piece of rib eyes and hear about how did that that is something that happens to people they were they have no idea what the fuck they're saying it's called hypnotic that is the classification of drugs it it falls under and people do all sorts of involuntary things when they're on it no it doesn't just make you say racist thing but you didn't say anything intentionally racist beside and I also was referencing my very favorite movie so if we could talk about how fucking awesome that movie Planet of the Apes people get your come on people now it's like come on it's like the hundredth monkey is at the bank is that the name of it monkey on the type what is the house that work that if you have a certain amount of monkeys this is just something 99 times in a row the hundredth time it's gone into their DNA the hypothetical phenomena which new Behavior ideas claim to spread rapidly by unexplained means from one group to all related groups once a critical number of members of one group exhibit a new Behavior or acknowledge the new ID critical mass the did the thing is a lot of people put pictures of that woman right next to the lady I understand and I am not going to do with that picture I didn't say she looks like anything seriously I'm not that fucking shallow okay I never talk about nobody slugs unless they're like sandon blondin I'm jealous but and useful now but or whatever wasn't there another tweet that you made a long time ago about who is that other woman Susan Rice giant swing eight balls but she's a man giant swing baseball regionalism I'm from Utah and all the girls and you told him we got married and are we hurt our moms do it too it's always where's your eight they go what you're doing Sunday it is like always watching football all good let's go out to lunch you know that's how it is in a breeder culture like Salt Lake City breeder call Jeff culture so it's like where's your ape and there's like man you're a poop has big balls I give him that you know it's a regional thing and you know so I used it and apologize but you know cuz I I didn't realize sometimes forget racer videos as if I could tell half the time anyway I can't even see people to tell you the truth I need like bifocal trifocals and I never identified other human beings by what they look like forgot to take out I just could tell if I felt the liking to him you know it whatever they look over the course of thousands don't mess my point I said so she has she has incredible audacity that's what I meant and she. But you didn't mean in a complimentary way if someone is audacious is that negative or positive are you talking about her in a negative way though she has a lot of audacity that's what I meant whatever it was that got brought up as well and the Iran deal those are the two things are two of the three things that I like to do on Twitter although no longer on their Kanye West. Off to delete all this account last week and I was glad to cuz you're just like once your target but it's just too painful definitely shouldn't be reading that shit but when you become a Target how do you know if you don't read it well I know what I lived through when it first happened and that's been like 4 or so months ago so I just know how I reacted in my real life since that happened to me that's all I ask. Die off for the Slowdown where they weren't is coming after you constantly like I told you that news crews when they found out that you were going to come on the podcast the first time they were trying to show up at my house they're trying to show up at the studio they were trying to find me at The Comedy Store I mean they were just trying to hunt down anything about you I did it you know we are at home in Salt Lake City when I tweeted at 2:11 a.m. I just woke up and I had this thought in my head oh my God this can make so much sense and then I treated it and I went back to sleep and when I woke up at 7 this shit hit the fan you know but it was one of those kind of things you just want to get it down and you know I always slept with my computer and sweet when I wake up like you know when you're all day after the bathroom alot saw his tweet and fall back to sleep and then Ambien treats my daughter I used to always when I took my Ambien I call my daughter and she or she called me shka you're starting to do the Ambien treats get off get off at Twitter you know so I just called my daughter then every night when I when I was doing the Ambien and I'd go you know what here comes a big fish eats recorded it here comes a big fish always getting stuck in the mirror and said that's what she goes mom turned it all out and go to sleep I have to have my family tell me that standing guard by your bed were you surprised she tweets all these liberal things that I want to get up and just get up in her face and smack her around 4 but it ain't for me while mother I didn't lose everything we're only trying to help you is just issue a serious liberal and my daughters are serious and I'm crazy they always did like you know they always thought all my choice for president were crazy but then oddly they were all very supportive when I personally ran for president in 2012 they were really supportive of me then their mom baby boomers are the reason everything is all fucked up so stop playing yourself conversations in the bar household what was it that when you first got brought into a mental hospital what was it about I buy a car and the hood ornament went in my head and my brains and scrambled on and I I used to be a plus math student I was just grade in Geometry all my God I love geometry I got straight A's and then you know I start fell apart after that took a long time to heal from it and you know how much did your personality change but you know what you read all that stuff about traumatic head injuries now cuz I do read a lot and talk to a lot of football players have the same thing and we do discuss it but still you but it's like a kind of like an article artificial intelligence you to find much more impulsive oh yeah yeah here's what happened I was crossing the street on my way to school I will do you have a 16 now it's 15 call dad first week of high school has a big nerd was crossing the street and it was a top of the hill and this woman girl she's on her way the university and the sun blinded her and she ran me over panda breast is her straight how how long were you in the hospital for so first you must have been there you must have been in a medical hospital first and then you were missed admitted to a mental hospital afterwards and I had a head concussion and a brain concussion and I had hamburger meat for legs so they did all these what do they call in skin grafts on my legs and yeah I was in there for a while then I came out of there and I had forgotten everything about math when I return to school we're matter of weeks after that maybe two months I'm really tight on time now but and I forgot all my math and it was just terrible that was a big depressive depression I wanted to because I couldn't remember why I couldn't remember things you know and also became way more impulsive then I was like I don't know what I did and then I started going really out there into the ethers way out there now so wait out you know how you go way out do you have to go way out terrible mostly just punch is it kicks nothing like car accidents are never played football but my head injuries of you know they were just more of cumulative when I was young so I was about 21 22 on stop stop fighting stop sparring but nothing but I definitely I'm subject impulsive behavior keep it under wraps but keep it under control because I'm aware of it when I was younger I didn't understand what was going on I would just be subject to whims very addictive behavior but I try to keep it positive but it would be addicted to things addicted to doing things addicted to games addicting like ridiculously addictive I spend 10 12 14 hours a day playing video games that sounds like my kid completely obsessed with it and be thinking about it all day it wasn't necessarily healthy and just on a whim I would just want to go do something I just almost had no control over compulsions and I think some of that is whatever brain injuries that I've had a very mild in comparison to a lot of people that I know certainly very mild in comparison to yours and but I don't know crime in the state hospital that you know I'm like you know being there and seeing and experiencing so what was it that they brought you in there for what was how are you behaving that they decide that you need to be admitted I was out there to say that what does that mean I don't think there's any words the English you just can understand and never control of reality you didn't have control of your behavior your thinking was screwed up you know not thinking like the normal thing that they say you should be thinking about and but people around you and realized it that it was it was so bad that they had to admit you to the hospital wasn't just a overdose and she's eccentric it was she needs actual medical help I asked to be admitted at the time will you completely aware that it was connected to your car accident no you just knew something was wrong and back then they didn't really kind of understand that the way they understand that now too much about bipolar disorder or they knew nothing about multiple personality disorder trauma trauma related your PTSD now they don't even Sadie anymore they say PTS post-traumatic stress so when they admitted you what was the treatment like what did they do to you when you were inside the mental hospital well they right away put me on an anti-psychotic there you were gone I was gone I was just watching these people I was in the mental institution with and I wanted to tell that story cuz there was this one lady I think I told this to Paul Reubens too I think it might be where he got Large Marge and I can't remember her name either large you know I thought your man this this chick's got some good lines you know I know it's tradelines with her and she'd laugh you know you you know I was like jokes that's the key to life I think but I search everybody called me chunky that was my name chunky and are there was another girl in there named shorty so it was chunky and shorty we were like a Duo but anyway so she's like Harold's and get what's your name is Keys when they go to dinner and open this up here you don't come in here I'm like okay now after all I was crazy to Anna I don't know I just always I never questioned that there was danger anywhere I always got in trouble you don't got beat up something you but so I did it you know and I can't because that was her name the head nurse I hated her cuz she told me I needed it but I'll tell that story later it was horrifying it changed my life but they all go to dinner so I go in there to steal the keys out of her thing where they re no attendance and I'll go in there with Margie I'll leave the keys in the door and close the door yeah so I'm like hey Margie. How's it going Marge and she's like chunky you know why they put me in this text Geiger cigarette I don't know why no I don't know why well Junkie because they consider me to be dangerous I'm like how come I am on like Gomer Pyle seriously and I'm told you're like 16 that I'm 15 about 8 minutes into it I realized oh shit oh shit something's going on here that's how long it always took me to like zero in on what's happening cuz I'm not even there you know I'm always ignoring when other people talk I don't listen they yeah I'm always in my own head I never get out really except for when I work so then it got then it took a turn you know she's like so it got to why do they consider you dangerous you know I had to ask it cuz she kept on getting married to that point where she wanted me to ask it I was trying to delay it and you don't cuz I knew they'd be back in 40 minutes and it's like going on 20 now she goes I made it here because that's my voice I got to do I'm in here because I broke up with you by accident I tell you that like I know how to do that and in my head I'm thinking don't change don't miss a beat don't miss a breath don't look no where does it keep on acting all you know Utah Utah girls well that's when it hit my head that if she's talking about you know I'm a I'm feeling like prey and I go how'd you do that cuz I'd figure out why it's an accident you know it's girl Marge she sells good jokes she goes well it's easy you just know I'm doing me again I got to do one hand here in one hand where'd you learn that I'm changing the subject how was your mom what was the school like you went to what's your favorite book what's your favorite color what kind of ice cream you like never seen that there's worms in the oatmeal you ever noticed that she started that one got her she's like I did how did nurses grow on motherfukers I got ya and expect us to eat that this is this what you know I like suddenly I'm transported to A Confederacy of Dunces when he's on the thing against Levi pants remember that rant then I hear it click I grab I got up fumble the keys out of the door put them back in the attendance room went in my room we should be here click the first door of God open there was two doors that I heard the first door open they're coming back from from dinner so you got away from this house in my room so I'm just laying there and that was like daily I mean there were so many weird people in there we had this one girl Rosie her name was where she dies grab she always end up with a pair of real sharp scissors and one for someone's throat what you get them so you know that was good that I was on there for the shit I saw you say it to my friends house so I saw worse than that would you say you know victims of abuse terrible for the guards all victims of ameristep that came in that were mentally scarred by there now put you on antipsychotics was because you were exhibiting psychotic behavior alleged what what kind of psychotic behavior well they thought it was psychotic I was just scared that I think I was throwing them off cuz I wanted to think I was so I got it I didn't want to think them to think I'm schizophrenic I knew enough not to let him near me that cuz what you got the want you got the diagnosis of skitzofrenic they would you measure shocks and I don't want that so maybe I you know and then you don't so yeah I was doing weird things like walking down the middle of streets after hit by the car I walk down the middle of street I don't know I thought all you got to get over your fear of crossing the street that's what was in my head and then I'd walk down the highway and I know I was in a whole other round it was like a real cereal estic and metaphysical room and I drew comfortable there but you know I think most artists writers and performers are in that world I mean at least I come in and out you know you know now I think I'm on the right medications that help me there's a lot of comedians that have similar stories you know some of the greats you know Kinison as a similar story to you he was hit by a car and change his personality radically and it happened in a similar age is it happen when he was young as well and he was one person then you get hit by a car and then after the car he's as wild man totally impulsive I just thought different just I don't know my mom says when I was 18 months old I used to go out in the street and direct cars they live on a highway and you know that she come and find me there just ate too much all the holes not my hands Jesus Christ stopped in traffic it's always had a weird thing going there but you know I don't know I think I watch too much of that police you know where they stopped traffic I used to love TV shows and think they were real some of it how many people do you think notice about your mental health history you know anybody who knows me I don't think very many people know what they were angry at you oh yeah they did I don't think they did yeah they did people look past the surface I think they looked at you as a rich white lady who said something that they considered to be racist and they decide they were going to attack you and then the perception the Optics of this is the reason why ABC cancelled the show the reason why it was ABC right now and what is that feel like when nobody defended you people who should know you the way I know you and I defended you from the very beginning because I said looking like this is not racist person hilarious I'm going to be around it was for the reasons why I love you but I don't know they're scared people are scared to support someone that they considered to be racist now I mean I got a lot of shit from you but I don't give a fuck I didn't tell me what they wanted don't change me but doesn't change me it just takes time before the dust settles and I knew that once I knew that wants you and I talked if you and I sat down talk like this people get a chance to see who you really are well are you know they may not like me but I don't have to you're not a bad person you never been a bad person name dropper I asked him first but he's been through some stuff you're like well the thing is you got it you got it become pacifist that's that's your only yeah don't battle with people know you can't battle people back and forth online you know I mean there's too many people it's not enough time and you'll go crazy you'll get wrapped up in conflict and you'll just be involved in it every minute of every day what's it's definitely a strange strange environment where all these people are just they don't even know you have no contact with the other than that you are this person they could reach and get to react to certain lines and the more explosive and the the more derogatory and insulting the lines he said he the more impact is going to have on you so that flavors the way they communicate with you yeah it was tough working with a lot of social justice Warriors and remake find me mentally so when you mean like the staff that you were working with the only one saying I'm not a republican nor am I fucking Democrat I'm an independent and I'm just anti-corruption I'm just anti-corruption don't don't make me into your idea of who I am what was their idea who you were supported President Trump a racist and a scumbag and you know Aunt I ever just cuz I vote for him why did you support Trump I love what Norm McDonald said if I can quote him can I quote no he said the American people I hated Hillary so bad that they voted for a guy they hate it even worse I just arrived that is Norm Macdonald that's brilliant that is so true Alec basically comes down to a woman's turn but you know I'm a I just want a guy that works for the American people that I pay taxes and I expect for my taxes and you know here's news they're all of them out there and put it in all of this I think it's sometime the American people need to audit what happened to their tax money and I think we should all have a say in what this country does with our hard-earned dollars and don't just assume you speak for us because obviously you don't or we wouldn't have a trade deficit of 20 trillion dollars so STFU Anna Let the American people handle what they should handle in this country is a republic and it's runs on the on the consent of the governed it's really really time to talk about that when you say social justice Warriors that you had to work with a specifically what were the issues that you were dealing with Will trump was the big elephant in the room my support for Trump and they're just their patronising shite can I call it well we have to remember that the I mean I'm going to paraphrase but it was a lot while you know the ignorant unwashed people who voted for Trump it's not their fault that was kind of what it was like cuz I said well you know it was Working Class People that elected Trump so I I really can't I can't let you say that to me cuz it's not true yeah they already had in their head what it means and of course they are wrong like they're wrong about you know this being about a lien of it Cavanagh being about abortion right the wrong about that too so you know cuz I don't think you know he said pretty much that you know you can't overturn something that's in law longer to get everybody thinking that's what they were after and I don't think it is what they were I don't think that is why they wanted to anyone that Trump trying to get to the Supreme Court any any bills that Trump trying to pass a should put on there adult pants and get involved and make sure that he represents you know the will of the people of this country you have to become involved in the process then but don't just sit there on your butt criticize and everybody and calling everybody names that's really not any kind of Justice Warrior that's all you got to get involved you were first approached about doing a Roseanne relaunch when they came to you how how did this all take place and did you get the pic the people that you work with I had already said about a year prior to that that I supported Trump over Hillary and it was like a big it was in all the papers in Hollywood how how could she and the other but didn't seem to bother the American people outside of the industry not for the industry now Ministries ruthlessly left like to the point where it's not even that thinking thing it's just like they automatically go left because that's the way you're accepted in this town that's the way you stay working that's the way you stay invited all the good parties stalinist types in Show Business keep it you know you know everything about the media is tightly controlled in Hollywood so when they came who came with the relaunch how did it as it happened it wasn't sure they did a sketch on Sarah's talk show and everyone liked it and Sarah called me and said she said John said he's in a few you know if you're in so you say was good after this was over well I'm Mike oven of lawyers advised as I not get into this at this time on me I think it was always that way since you know I came in and said somebody on the show has to be a trump supporter none of them would do it I'm like it's a great role you know you could do it you're the kind of person who would turn they were like no so I said okay well then I'll do it because you know I did vote for him every knows it people forget Archie Bunker twin the cutest characters and nobody wants to be the quote on quote you know other the bad guy in Hollywood or other in Hollywood but you know I was up for it I thought it would be great I thought it would be you know I get some wines in there from the other side once in awhile you know I I let him say all they want to say I never told them don't say that about him don't just now like the day of the filming you know I've been saying you know I left my ride or do there but I lay out all the stories or approve them you know and so it was that for show and I'm waiting for a line about Hillary I go I let you have seven Trump trucks in this show and you can't even want fucking Hillary joke what was the Hillary job to remember I said you better get me a Hillary joke why do they not want to Hillary choke do they have an explanation for it they wanted Hillary they felt it would go against their morals to say that there's another way to vote or if to acknowledge that you know half the country voted that way or that she's extremely flawed well that point they didn't care that's what's weird about it there's a complete denial of reality this is not there's nothing to do with the women that has nothing to do with liberals it is you're talking about an extremely flawed person I'm not going to talk about her as a person I just talked about her Concepts in her body was extremely flawed politician with a background of deep corruption and lies demonstrative allies like this we're not talking about some amazing Jem you know let's just put it like this a lot of us people who like Bernie voted for Trump will specially when they found out when Donna brazile book came out they found out what they have done to Bernie during the primaries yeah it's dark shit it's dark that they just everybody's like whatever whatever they slipped it under the rug to this day still doing stupid shit like that but the idea cuz I liked her healthcare plan better at that time when I was still owed you know how before I walked away so you know they're doing a whole March I might show up for what walk away walk away from what the Democrat Party who is that guy who's doing this whole bunch of kids youths park there and make statements the walking away to wear to an independent party libertarian the Polar Opposites the right and the left the blue and the red Trump paid Clinton to be at his wedding you got a photo up and a half out of that one are you pay those people forever it's one of the reasons why I went when he was campaigning that he had you know so much animosity towards them and towards the system that he was a part of for so long he was a Democrat most of his life while he's getting he's getting it to that just proves it right there you know they give money to both parties and going Hollywood they don't just give you the Democrat Party well it's kind of smart. Cover your bets you know which government contractor to be able to dip into and isn't that like what Holly was really all about so many levels to it right I mean there's the the blatant tribalism of right versus left where people pick a side and they adopt a predetermined pattern of behavior and they adopt a conglomeration of ideas and opinions yes and they're just bought exactly and then below the surface you got geopolitical aspirations and you have the the global war machine that's that's what you have the money the real money whatever they call me but I have optimism and I said for a long time when when the right people are at the controls of all the machinery and technology that will be so great for Humanity we have it right within our grasp if you know make sure that this is a good place for all kids we could do that tomorrow so I think we should start thinking about that and all this artificial intelligence that gets us fighting with each other let's just step out of it like the Matrix you know it's go to a new place where we're about Solutions and working together bringing this country together and getting some real good jobs real good health care things that we pay taxes for better streets good education the things we pay taxes for yeah and mental health most of all I think that's what we need to prepare for our veterans they come back and then their untreated they won't even give them marijuana which really helps they want even legalized that you know people who have PTSD and marijuana does help with pts and you know you know talk about supporting our troops 22 of them a day are killing themselves are homeless I mean that that's who we are I don't want that to be who we are come on people think nobody can see us and what we do but they do and they they want it right people want things to be right and work and used for the good of all people in September and people apart from each other we're neighbors you know that was what I wanted to go back to the Roseanne show and say all those things and I'm so happy that I did I did it in 9 episodes I wanted to 10 season and I did all night episodes were exactly the episodes I wanted to do so and it was number one every week and I just think my fans for that you know a turn of Fortune but I did what I want to do and and it was so gratifying and so wonderful and I don't want that to be forgotten I don't want that night season to disappear I'm in the 10th season to disappear what do you think about them doing it without you how fucking weird is that it is weird I'm like oh I get it they're sending me a subtle message to OD on opioids now that's is that what you think yeah that some of it so you think that they want you to kill yourself or doesn't make any sense I just I just think they're being completely inconsiderate they don't care about you as my contribution to the show too it's just you know what shocking that was the most painful part of the whole thing but what are the things that I read was that you hadn't considered the more than 100 people that work on the show when you did what you did and I'm like that is that's a ridiculous statement I didn't cancel the cancel the show you were on Ambien drunk tweeting the idea that you did this this is some sort of a deliberate ploy to get the show canceled or the idea that there's any justification that you show can should be cancelled at all like what you can't just say something that you you didn't want to come out that way and apologize for it they don't know who you are apologize but they don't know where you are 3 months now. They don't know who you are I want to do it like me off the map of the culture be connected with anybody who's at Target and they act like Howard's I mean if it were my friend definitely I would have years of two decades or more I would have said something about just me and I definitely one thing I would never have done is stab somebody in the rush to condemn somebody who you know what's my biggest advocate where was the law sometimes and I saw a lot of that I tried I am a person of belief and I just always try to do what's right in front of me I feel like what you know my higher intelligence place in front of me I'll do it cuz it knows better than me and which is why I don't think like other people but also that I was not going to fight not at 66 I'm too old I'm pretty frail and I think you know I worked really hard to get a second season and it's kind of ironic cross-stitch time zones to do promotion for free for months and you know during that time when you're old and you can't sleep and you're Crossing time zones going from Hawaii to New York and back and then back again and Back Again you know I kind of became dependent on Ambien and I almost every night took it and you know obviously something was wrong because I I didn't think I thought that tweet was about a science fiction movie which happens to be my favorite movie and which I think is very apt in in the world today particularly Ron we're just a small group of corrupt leaders are oppressing the citizens and I think it I think there's a lot of references in that movie is that go along with what's happening in a Ron of the human beings rising up the throw over there tell if your throw their overlords and that's how I was looking at the whole thing so when I woke up to 23rd and that was what was in my head it was certainly not somebody's looks and it was also about the Arab Spring Egypt Which Wich you know Obama he didn't handle it right and so all those things are interrelated with a Ron and the Iran deal the Iran nuclear deal you know I'm extreme ugly well read on that subject I certainly wouldn't be at the height of my power and my fame being on there going home I'm not an idiot okay I went down there a monkey I'm a well-read and intelligent woman and my word and things that I write to people over in that part of the world there brought a lot of people together in that part of the world with my tweet I must of my tweets are being a spiritual in nature anyway so people thought it was and still I apologize for inadvertently hurting anyone's feelings still I apologize and not you know if I apologize if they were wrong and they miss heard it I misunderstood it but that wasn't good enough either and you know just get to a point where I go I'm letting go of it. My fans who know me and my family and people who like me and know me for my life they know who I am and that's all that matters you know they can call me whatever they want I don't accept their definition of that word and I think that they should read more 1 things it's most shocking about this outrage culture that we live in right now the sage of outrage is that there's no path to Redemption is there no acceptance of the general public never felt so much love your career in real life and not on Facebook social media because you're not interacting with people in the real Flash experiencing social cues you're not looking in the eye and not seeing them as a person you just seen them as a Target online. I think the Twitter app has is a purposeful plan like Facebook I got off Facebook years ago cuz I realize what they were doing same thing that Facebook. Also its manufacturing consent and you know is using Bots to do it so I can know I'm Trump's he says you know the Press manufactures can sent the consent of the governed so that's what they're doing is manufacturing the consent of the governed but they also manufactured dissing they control the opposition to lunch with her and I like getting in between those two and causing a rough guess cuz I know it was all artificial intelligence anyway it's all just a track us we all know that just like they do in China so what are you saying you think there's some sort of a grand plan to get people to argue with each other just divide and conquer as long as we're like you know it's all these people getting robbed all these taxpayers getting robbed sitting there pointing to other taxpayers they're getting robbed and blaming them but nobody everybody needs to look up word of our government ask for an audit of our taxes and actually take responsibility for the things are country does we're getting judged for it anyway I think it's certainly people that are capitalizing on all this chaos and all this to all the conflict but I don't think it's manufacturer that I don't think it's engineered I just think it's happening he has this is a new thing this this ability to interact mind of its own people have a mind of their own people are inherently tribal there's almost no it stopped African tribal and they switched tribes you brought the problem with tribalism is it you sometimes have enemies that are unnecessary so you do you develop this idea that you were part of a group is a tribal world that's how I do look at the world and why I didn't want Hillary Clinton because her party is very much for corporate law and the Republican party is very much for tribal and I am a tribal person and I I think tribal people should you know I have their land well I'm Jewish when I go over there to the Middle East I visit the graves of my teachers that's how I'm tribal I go to their graves and you know that's what we do that's what all indigenous people do they want to control their sacred burial grounds and that is anti corporate law and that's why I'm anti-corporate lot I can't I like to study paper bowls and corporate law and maritime law and all that kind of stuff you know I don't like to read so I have a lot of information it makes me angry or sad that that the work of an artist over 30 years they think that we just pulled out of their ass and that they can copy it now without the artist they can copy it or show I do it is all the stuff I suffered in my life I put into that show that show is about my phone my children and it's just like wow that is so huge it's so huge it's it it's beyond entitled plan and how how are they able to do that did you let them signed off of talk to 30 years or more in my life about Labor rights and the rights of working people if I took away those p200 people's jobs so that's why I did it and I know how they had planned on another season and they had already spent the money was there any consideration was there any path where they could allow you to apologize or to something that would endear yourself to the people where they would accept your apology I said let me go on all your ABC shows and explain my tweet how it was a political and not a racial tweet and you know that was denied me it's like you can't say anything till you sign off you can't say anything until you sign up so they wanted you to sign off the rights and then they would have you do whatever you want to do go on the interview shows so they just wanted you to sign off and they offered you nothing return but the idea was just to be able to redo the show 20 years of those situations to come back and took me 20 years to figure out how would these characters where would they be now and I did that by living among regular normal people for 20 years I never left behind you know racially segregated Gates watch other stars and working people's neighborhoods and I farm around farmers and I sure do it's gorgeous you should come and see it I love it I love the Big Island isn't it gorgeous amazing people are dumb lady took a boat full of people too close to volcano don't look at it and the lava over took their boat and thank God no more chill but they were got like about 2 feet up on call cheese that isn't that Hawaiian volcano on one of the boats to they were having lava tourism and someone got clipped by a rock it's so not smart so stupid it's a jake dangerous dangerous situation is your area safe area flooded roads for years I really got into making that's one thing that I really did enjoy it so I'll be headed back there and be making more road so I'm excited about it I can cut a road like nobody's business but my granny is a scout and cuz I do Scout the jungle you know how to make a road in there I love the attitude of people that live in the Big Island it's a very relaxed laid-back friendly attitude they they just have all the time in the world to different sort of vibe when you go there they don't like turn them in every kind of people you can think of it it's very very diverse cultural I went there cuz my son Buck I had I made him go to the school out there so then I bought a place right by to the school because this can do you know he's 23 now so I won't get mad but he had some severe ADHD there so I had to do what I did to get him now he just graduated from college he's doing real good he's my first college grad ADHD maybe he's a comic he's so funny oh my God he's so hilarious, just wait sure it's in his DNA show me are all hilarious very funny what are they going to do to your character on the show didn't tell me now they didn't tell me I weird is it some of my spies told me how weird is it they're taking you out of Roseanne they're calling it The Connors it's all going on without you being there what does it feel like it's a mindwarp and I mine fuck guess I'm just trying to borrow from a tweet I miss understood tweet I misunderstood tweet while you're on Ambien while you're drunk dealing with your fucked up I wasn't in French I was at my mom's house and on the cigs I went down in the basement I was hiding down there in the basement cuz they were surrounding my mom's house paparazzi's and such and such a down in the basement and that's where I always used to go when I was like 13 and I found this stuff from chalk on the on the walls of the basement there that I remembered right when I was 13 and then I found an old but when I stop at 6 when I searched it smell good when they're smoking they were not, my mom's door and I was like oh my God for my boyfriend got the door he's like a big man you know he's like Mariel to my man character Anna I thought they were going to say something in there like we just please tell Rose and we love her and you know we don't like this and blah blah and that was having all the time and that's what I was like geez I've never ever felt this kind of affection from people in all my career so it's kind of a cool that's that's the thing there's the social media outrage and then there's a people in real life to feel terrible for you cuz they feel like you got a rod deal so many double standards of people who said things on the air remember I just said it to a small population less than 600,000 people on Twitter but these people say things on the air and they are not well I know Joy had to call parents and apologize I suck your what is Joy Behar say about Pence it was so bad she ate something about his Christian faith you know an apology with your network behind you really works like with what's her name that called Ivanka the names find her and that's far more fence event was on the air and but when your network is not behind you you don't really and they weren't not behind me they didn't want me to tweet the whole the whole truth is I told him I wasn't going to Tweet and you know I promised him over and over and although they never send it in writing which was required but anyway they called my publicist and unload it on him all the time and you know I should have stayed to myself and you know I made a mistake and the ball kept rolling but it's just crazy that this what I think is an insignificant mistake especially in light of your apology could lead to No Redemption possible that No Redemption possible that this giant fucking hit show and I look I don't know what's going to happen with the Connors but I think it's going to fail if you asked me if I had some money to bet if I was in Vegas this pitch it ain't going to work how to get how to get to do Roseanne without Roseanne if you wanted to have a whole new sitcom with all those people with a totally unrelated story line that's one thing but you don't think America is going to know that they killed you off like what the fuck is that and then the end now with time and consideration after time has passed and people can review everything they're going to go was it really this bad and they got to think about their own lives like about me but if I say something fucked up just fucking around with that take Ambien and accidentally say something crazy don't even remember saying it and then it's misconstrued or V comes out wrong is it going to ruin my whole life like how can you have someone ruin their whole life for something that is misconstrued I mean that's why I think first of all us women we need to do a better job of raising our sons and butt at 17 everyone's out of their freaking mind there's not a one of them who didn't do something rendus at age 17 know who's in here earlier but yeah when when young man especially young men that don't get a bird and the bee speech and who knows what the fuck is going on their home you know people do stupid shit on sexual assault to all the boys I guess I gave it to the girls too but he said he read it and he realized it was any kind of sexuality at all you don't even do it and I told both my sons you got to get if you're going to have sex with somebody you make him sign a consent form and have take it to their lawyer and get it properly notarized and then make a date for after even that's not good enough time for our sons and our daughters it's always a dangerous time for women right if you were with the wrong man are you shiting me women are just as horrible as man I'm so wither horrible with women to this one of those what does statistics on sexual assault and rape amongst lesbian couples it's it's pretty bad but I mean what about rape in the prisons and nobody talks about that that's that's the real rape culture where men are learning you know it is terrible get into depth about how bad prisons are in general and how people aren't redeemed Orange is the New Black Billet ation mean it's it's very very little at least in in prisons what you you're doing is you take people to make them better criminals or make them or hardened criminals who you surrounded with other criminals to give him a horrible work further cuz most prisoners are in there cuz they're abused children Rand on legalization of marijuana for that exact reason both slowly but surely that's becoming a mainstream I'm glad to Rabbit pot user I love it now I think marijuana's makes you a more sensitive where person it definitely makes you paranoid but I think that paranoia allows you to understand all the danger in the world that you probably ignoring your own mortality like I was with Marge and a good thing you should be paranoid of people should be aware of for sure the ID channel is all of what are you doing now like what are you going to do now you were saying that you have some other things cooking you know I got 20 thousand ideas a day while you do something like that I got to focus and do something but something like this so easy for you to help me I will help you I don't know how to write in a fucking password turn this shit on you don't need that we can get you connected to someone to do that for you that shit's easy to talk to other people who fallen from grace and see how they get back up but the the real truth of it is that there is redemption there is there is moving on and there is like stopping the fight and there was like you know for me it was I realized they're not my family my real family is you know a joy to me and I got a great real family I raced to Goodson's and then of course I want them protected from crazy women for crying out loud I over modulate they're dating my mom to give you right now I love you shut the fuk up the you know we can't have no bitches up in here I can't take no telling me I'm beneath her that's why I help break up my son's marriage cuz she was she treated me you had someone is disrespecting you while I would never allow God all their sons they listen to me they do what I tell him so good son in laws that's good because I have a Russian accent well here's what he said to me knowing this family oh eh are you knew if you want to live a cursed life go ahead let you do is come around though I knew he would and he has ADHD to Anna but he's brilliant and as all of my grandkids and anyway so they are there those live tartu I should have said that no you can't say that you're not to say that I forgot I'm old I mix them up who says you're not say that I said you don't say the t words I don't say it but not but anyway so you know the kid he's bouncing off the walls to like all my kids were so I know how to deal with it you know I said just leave him over here with me I'll take care of it so I did scam active yeah you get him active exactly I go I bet you I bet you $100 you can't run up and down that Hill 10 times in a row got to keep boys tired yeah I guarantee I have hdhd I have all those things I think those kids just have a lot of fuel I do have a lot of horsepower in a lot of fuel and it's all misdirected and then they can't sit still control of the female say there they forget their selves girls do it to the key autonomy in what are they call it sovereignty you got to keep that find somebody who doesn't control you just accept you don't make your shower they have to make him shower on my way come from weird line of women that like that man smell it was gross my mom she is still always go over and see if Uncle my dad's armpits it was so gross no wonder I'm like I am so when you were in this you call white people monkey my dad was real dark dark brown my mom may be problematic she was there I hear you but to me I'll people look like some I mean I didn't say anything about Valerie Jarrett Ford on the subject I think people resemble animals a lot we are animals like I think I look like a beaver when I look at my pictures look like a beaver or a cat I think the fever my kids think I'm real cat life my boyfriend says sloth so I just lay there in bed watching the ID channel and murderers and sex because I love House characters put together right and characters you know you just like I like that forensics thing when they put it together you know and they got the purpose of our purpose of 40 year old white man lives with his mother and he's probably was in the Navy in all that so I would have done that wasn't a comic genius I think the real problem with that though is that the more you study that shit the more you live in that world that the less happiness you're going to find I've talked to guys that what world the world is serial killers the world how was life they were real hard time because they know too much they know too much about the darkest nature shows I've read books on serial killers in a while and I've known cops that investigated stuff like this when you realize that some people out there that are they have a dark mind they're capable some fucked up shit if you were around that all the time I just think your appreciation for it's like it's one thing to know that it exists and it's real but it's another thing to let that enter into your ear your view of the world and have it in there is a standard standard kind of behavior no nothing else interest me why is it interesting to you so much just getting such a bizarre aberration State killer right you know that one that they just that's the guy that that wasn't what he was called the Golden State killer that they just got away with it forever Patton oswalt's wife died of a drug overdose was actually investigating that she can I get some it might be good if I could get you I don't know what you're going to do I don't want to say nothing negative for the back you'll be like you could be like up from Beyond the Grave you could give advice to people on the show that be a great way they can kill you off and bring you back the same time yeah a ghost you come to John good in the middle of the night what the fuck are you talking about I come up with something better than just yeah they just letting it go I think I mean they do all these movies about robots in other words it's even if it's just as good if not better than it was when it first came out number one after 20 years what about the one stand up again I'm doing stand up next to ya bitches over you have a gag order so we can talk about the gag order or is that a part of gag order it's supposed to be careful that's all I'm going to say next year 2019 I can't remember what they said in the midwest all across the Midwest are you performing at all I mean and how you start out at clubs we going to do do casinos do you have a framework what you can talk about all that that entails are you going to bring someone with you on the road to warm up or it would be a blast that's a great idea love you great thing for you to stand up before you know in fact I think that's why I got so run down so run down when I you know this whole thing I was so run down at that point that I had no B vitamins in my body how's it impossible I mean I was at a really low level and the doctor said you know that can cause psychosis so that's why I got okay that's what happened to me really I was late I was getting laid out there and Salt Lake City Utah anyway after I I did do stand-up all through Canada and then I ended up in New York doing promo for Roseanne and you know I just got to run down I didn't know I didn't watch myself and do what I should have done for my physical health vitamins and Aniston get somebody who's going to hang out do some blood work on you and make sure everything's okay that's good but every 3 months cuz I I don't absorb minerals or vitamins years ago and I can absorb minerals or vitamins until I have to go get infusions every you know when I get to down and I like I said I was promoting the residential and also doing some touring to Canada and I got to run down and I I just I think I had a mental collapse I told the network I said obviously I'm not behaving in the right way and I I will check myself in and get my meds check to make sure I'm you know you know so I said I have mental health issues and you know I said also I thought that one was white and it wasn't anything about race it's about Iran and it was like well we'll see how this washes out in Sherman yeah we'll see and then Sara Gilbert tweeted shortly thereafter something about she was ashamed of one cast member and what that one blew me away and Michael Fishman tweeted he was ashamed of my racism or some shit and that was hard to take but it was because it was so it seemed to work yesterday too because they use the same words you know egregious unforgivable but in fact it might have been offencive and like when I was talking to Mike today I said you know we all say things that are racially insensitive at times all of us do that I'm a Jew I've heard everything and it'll or ethnically expensive to somebody but that doesn't mean where the KKK okay that doesn't mean we're you know if we apologize because most people who are offencive they mean to be offencive and they don't apologize and I think that's when you know there's a difference and if you don't have to discretion to understand that something's wrong with you and I think something's wrong with people that they're so hateful and so unforgiving and if you don't vote the way they think you should vote that they feel justified in being so what's the words sucks so sanctimonious and self-righteous and when they themselves hurt yeah I'm kind of saying for more offense of things about people's children and such for instance I think people are just cowards and I think when things like this happen they want to separate themselves from controversy and make sure that they're not a part of the pack and I can understand that I can kinda understand it but I don't get it I don't get really really upset when a few years later somebody does the exact same thing to them around comes around and that's true especially true in Hollywood the guy that fired me just was fired a couple weeks ago I don't know what his contract wasn't renewed and his last words were well I didn't know I'd be forced to cancel our number one show it wasn't forced to do any well he might have been forced they're all fools they should just first of all they should have let the dust settle second of all they should have examine what you actually said and what your intentions were and you apologize and then have a conversation with you on one of their shows in long form her on the Iran deal and explain what I said what I said your Tweet but it would have been a teachable moment but it also would have been a distraction from what you were trying to say and you know it involve like openly politically on the television show Taylor Swift what she say just had to get out and vote but it's really get out and vote you know she's not black but she didn't like her although Marsha Blackburn has been the author of a lot of great anti-rape laws and all kinds of stuff like that but she don't like her cuz she's a republican so she took a stand political stand I guess you know some people can do it but some people can't and the political stand I took which I just want to remind people is that I'm an independent that's my stance and I just thought both sides had gone too far out need to talk to each other so I came back into the show about that let's dance you took with your show you yeah man in my life it's like if we can even discuss things that's really really bad from shots not American we discuss and debate we don't label and Black List we certainly can talk things and maybe that's something you could have done once they had a conversation with you about your Tweet but I mean I just think that what they did was just very Hasty and very foolhardy and they should have known who you were before hand that should have known about your mental health issues they should know they should have known about your medication issues all those things but this is what my point was if you have a person with a broken leg and they can't run and you get mad at him cuz they can't run that does not ridiculous if you have a person that has brain issues and then they still do something that's erratic and you're mad at him for that will your a fucking idiot that's stupid and you you call them a racist or chastise them in front of the world so that you remove any possible negative opinions that could be cast your way but that's what a lot of it is is deflection they're worried about negative opinions and negative feedback is going to come their way so they immediately turn on you they turn on you in a disproportionate Way by Sarah Silverman's bet I'm for against it and don't forget Stitt is a lot of jobs and people panic because people are aware of the outrage culture that we live in this is an outrage Nation right now it's it's one of our number one forms of recreation people love it they love getting mad and whoever the fuck it is as long as you react the way they want you to react they love it it's an Inquisition well it's it's the understanding that people have way more power to effect change whether it's good change of bad change their pushing buttons with social media and without rage in Whitby their booties Express themselves it's unprecedented there's never been a time like this in history where people can Salem witch trial swam that proves you're a witch and then we have to drown you there is no it's no it hasn't said there has to be a loser still can't be two winners understanding of what's Happening Here and then in people have to have an understanding of the power that they're wielding and what they're doing and that it turned back on them a surprise that a lot more comics didn't defend me because you know this means that anything they find it in your timeline that they think of defensive they can mischaracterize and bring the whole battle against you that you can't possibly win and take your life's work well how many did defend you nobody defended me why did you did thank you that worked with you but everybody to work if you wanted to keep their job and I don't blame them I don't have time and I pray that you donated money in prayer I already spent it well the sitcom life that that fucking schedule is ruthless it's cruel to know what I think it was a lot of it was you know I gave him the gun to shoot me I mean I wasn't a helpless victim although I think my explanation to either make sense or doesn't make sense but oh well if your compassionate it makes sense but I think it just chickenshit I don't think they're looking at it from in terms of like I can't win here and I can't lose here let me just look at what's right see I don't have anything to win or lose so what I looked at it I looked at you as someone that I admire someone I think is one of the best Comics ever who I think I know that you have mental health issues I knew from talking to you that you were on Ambien and I knew you had alcohol as well I know what that does my mom took Ambien look up in the middle of the night and Drew all over the bathroom rug draw over with lipstick and and and nail polish she said like a little kid to shut you woke up in the morning she had no idea she did it terrified of that shit she won't take it now any friends many friends that have had bad experiences on Ambien dangerous drug to for the wrong people in the wrong situations especially when you mix it with alcohol mean it's beneficial to people that need sleep in certain situations I don't recommend it I don't take it but some people like it that's fine but to ignore what the actual pharmacological effect on the human body is is ridiculous cuz their studies on this shit and the people understand the attraction between chemicals in the human brain and their erratic and especially when you mix them with things you're not supposed to mix in with weird should happen to drive me to just wait I thought it was going to I thought I was going to expand on it in the morning and let you know talk about that movie and too late yeah good idea but now I honestly don't know probably also a Twitter's fucking text is just too it's too simple it's too crude way of communicating you can get across some ideas like you can say hey I want to see Littlefoot to great movie that's a good thing to do simple shit like that weird to talk about things that are complex I just don't think it's the way that communicated Search and Destroy well for some folks yeah there's going to be people that always want to make things Crash and Burn to like it feel like hitting the buttons see people suffer definitely are suffering themselves look there's a giant percentage of our population that lives in Misery all day long and they did they have mental health issues they are exhausted they're depressed they're there they have to spare their overwhelmed with bills there in shity relationships they're overwhelmed and they're angry and they look at someone like you a rich white lady and like fuck that bitch and they just want to attack you and doesn't have to make sense because it's a reflection of their own personal pain as much as its reflection of their irresponsibility with this power that they're wielding for social media and then there's a mob mentality is a bunch of people that are already going after you good I'm glad I'm not racist you know how to do that I'm going to shit all over this racist is racist Roseanne didn't care if you're really racist thing that gets me about it isn't so I'm going to shit all over this too because I was talking about her on as a Jew and speaking about Persian Jews and you know all kinds of we talked about complexity but I was on there talking to defending or you know speaking for Jewish people and so you know I just I think that in the long run I really want it to be known that I am a Jew and was speaking as a Jew and when I spoke about the Iran deal and its effect on Jewish people in the Middle East and I really thought first they didn't know that but now I think well they had to know some of it I don't think this is what I think you say if someone says that's a black woman but she 1/8 black what is she something very small she had her DNA done was talking about it and forty something like Asian and I'm 1.6% African cool awesome that's the heart of the world when you look at what happened I think it's real simple I think she identifies or people identify here's a black woman you said Planet of the Apes racist is that simple I don't give a fuck of your Jew I don't think they care if you're not racist I think this is a viable Target, go outside and then I said I voted for Trump so I was at Target and then and then you can find a tweet from the past I like a woman to man oh yeah I'm I got in trouble for that many times things you can't say and then there's worse things that you can so it's weird cuz they don't censor anybody who's you know calling for a you know to kill all the Jews that there's thousands of them yeah they are tweeting support for Valerie Jarrett yeah they're pissed at me and saying how could you say this about their not so maybe know what your point was or whatever like I didn't know about her parentage I mean come on this is this is the truth this is who I am and you know what date they take the address to the valid comparison of all I'm a Jew but the people that you think you said something racist. Saying kill the Jews but they are okay you see how when people look at your situation I can see how they think but but you see how when people look at your situation and they think it's racist that is also how you look at their reacting to what they think is racist and you thinking the wrong everyday threatens the Jewish people in Israel with a nihilation and they've already survived you know not too long ago and I'm in dilation so and then we make a deal with that government what is that does say something this is many steps past but to me that a racist thing I understand that completely I have no idea they really don't have any idea I've never seen that I've never seen that because it's not important enough to them to know that it's probably not been explained to them for one I know your position and think it's valid like if they went back and went over it they might disagree with the political aspects of it to do that is not a valid comparison they're not really saying kill the Jews back to me and two other dudes they are in fact saying that and that's very common amongst us so you know that that's the truth that many of us and you know I understand it or they don't care to even consider it well they don't have to but I'm still going to say it because that's the reality it's the reality to hear that had to hear that United States went and gave them billions of our tax dollars under the number one supporter of Terror in the world it is and they always do kill Jews like in Paris and wherever else they go if they do it in London to I mean I hate white people up but you know it is important at least it is to me and two people like me and too many other people many Christians is very important to them to their under Onslaught to cuz you talking about Iranians killing people in Paris in England in the world are on but they're killing people in France and England a lot of times but there's a lot of people don't answer you wish woman to death in her and her Paris apartment there's a lot of it I'm not saying they only kill Jews but they do kill juice Santa goes back to those terrorist organizations that are funded by Qatar and if Ron this is there's a pretty this is these are General things you're saying right a family in Israel this is what we think and that this is how we feel and it's not even acknowledge that and any discussion and it's kind of disturbing it should I factored in it's a matter of not acknowledging it I think it's just a factor then as well here it is. Really Smiled On to go against the people who control arm media and say especially social media and say that your pro-israel or you know that you think you don't think that the media will allow you to be pro-israel and that seems like a really common thing why I see some anti-israel sentiment and especially in relation to where they treat the Palestinians like I see a lot of that well I asked I'm not going to play into either of those because I I really believe that you know there's a solution to that problem the solution is peace and I think it can be achieved so I can play either one of those games about who does this or what I just like to see a solution that works for all the people there all people there so but they can't be but it can't be if one side has been completely censored and if that isn't a discussion or is it a debate and nor is it in America scary it's scary time when you know like on a college campus today I know this because my son was on one and you know it's a far left their far-left professors at it's about that kind of stuff daily and all of our colleges and if does find its way to the media you look at the media that most what are they called Millennials Millennials consume and it's heavily to the left from only hearing one side of things on social media and I don't think that's good I don't think it's good that all conservative invoices are being censored off Twitter you know they all live in so many are because all the way to shutdown discussion 2 nice conversation. I just deciding that it this people who are heavily political or both sides are considered to come to it that's what consensus mean is adverse opinion and that's how you reach consensus you don't get a consensus Nora solution from only listening one side blather on the same ship for 20 years. One of my friends said he said he thinks Michael Moore that's Michael Moore's roll since he's a billionaire to that he's at it's like well he did get so many people to vote for Trump when he said that stuff about people are angry and they open for Trump for that speech which I don't give people that much suppression and you try to indoctrinate people into thinking a certain way is going to be able to resist it a large freedom of thought is the best of this country it's not freedom of speech or freedom of religion and freedom of expression the Second Amendment freedom of thought I did good to consume Angeles propaganda never have it broken down or or debated or pointed out that it's fault there is an issue when you're only getting one side of the argument in the people that are controlling the media only want that one side expressed that is a problem you know the people that are in charge of programming the network they don't want that seem to always companies in corporations always almost invariably lean left why do you think that is smart educated they're fresh out of college the colleges are in dr. dating left-wing kids and you know what you have a vast majority of professors at universities all across the country that identifies Democrats so this is the indoctrination they get from people that they respect the plane that they're learning from there's also understanding that this is the way you advance you know and then when someone comes out that has anything that deviates from that brain Center coordinator at coordinated in terms of the government I think what's happening in the University's is you've got people that are first of all their existing in this bizarre glass Walled Garden where they they'll go to universities to get in doctor into this left-wing cultures and then they start teaching at universities and they never get out into the real world and then they teach children these thoughts and ideas and then most of the kids leave and they take these idea somewhere else and then slowly over time they become more moderate most of them do or are they they reject those ideas and either go to the center or go right or some of them stay left but when they going to tech companies a lot of ankle center which is I think probably were sanity is coming Saturday somewhere I'm in the middle and I think discussion is critical I have a lot of friends that are Republican I have a lot of friends that are liberal there's nothing wrong with either either mindset and the only way we find out whether or not we really agree or disagree is we let people Express themselves and as soon as you suppress that kind of expression then you run into real problems that there was a trump lover and a trump hater in the same house and they managed to deal with it and get on with it is because there was that conflict and because let people can love a lovable curmudgeon people can love someone who has ideas if they disagree with people can love someone who lives with someone who has a completely opposing opinion they figure it out and they get along that's fine that's great that's how I feel like that's my boyfriend open the hate Christmas the certain amount of that when they found out that you're a trump supporter and then the show became successful and Donald Trump loved it and then Trump supporters loved it, I know and everybody remembers when you sang the national anthem and grab the crotch spit on the ground when you do that gastric bypass things that sound they can reverse they could reverse it but what the hell then I'll wait hundred what you really don't but you miss you and everything that's why I had it cuz I couldn't stop talking about addiction to pulse of right oh yeah all day long God damn things got gastric bypass surgeries I know they say people I just wish there was a better way to absorption abilities like you're talking about yeah I heard that from several people I know guys have gotten in they paint their way through it I'm sure I'll for sure a lot of it has to do with the the health of your you know your beautiful body your ability to absorb nutrients affects everything your mood your your energy levels everything you mean food doesn't get in there the right way I just lay in bed till they called for me enough then I'd like to stumble and do my thing go back to bed I just had no energy conversation because you could do this on your time whenever you want to do it without anybody telling you what to say I would not to say without an executive without anybody to fire you in YouTube You're Something I meant the kiss you off everything good but I don't think they would and on top of that you could do it off your own website you could do it on Roseanne Barr. Com yeah yeah I'm always afraid to let you know I just feel like hate this the time of my life from 66 is private time for me to just lay low do stand up sometimes and it's even better go do that and show us some of my farming videos when you do stand up and you go on a tour I think it's going to be hugely successful thank you I really do I think you were going to come out in droves I think is going to be awesome and I think once you get your legs under you you start doing a few shows and get things cracking again you'll be like the Roseanne of all do you crushing it I was crushing it I have to say the in my tour of Canada I was crushing machine it was a blast I had all my God I just had the most fun you can't watch out there are 30 minutes of beautiful control over bing bing and I got like a big laugh every 90 seconds love it love the people that come out to see me about the real make such as my abhorrence and fear of serpents you heard about what's going on down there why would people releasing pythons over decades you didn't know Florida is overrun with Pythons non-native pythons cuz he released them is Pats and then they moved the swamps and bread Heather of eating everything there's almost no mammals in the swamps now they said 99% of all raccoons are gone I couldn't find any Marsh rabbits they couldn't find any Bobcats and the the pythons start eating alligators thousands of them out there stay away from Florida turtle that kind of felt are we done me in Hawaii right now it's so weird now this is for true I've always been really afraid of serpents okay so so I go in the ocean there and my friends there like don't touch the turtles there's a $5,000 fine if something you don't touch and I'm like yeah what fuck them I'm catching it so I did and then turned start swimming around me and then it went in this big circle and its head came out of water in its side I'd me and I was like prices of the serpent I've been afraid of my whole life and he chased me onto the shore she goes that's why we don't touch do turtles because they bond with you like this guy wants me to marry him if you dare like a shield go for it it was a terrifying I've seen them in the water they're fucking cool to look at her swimming around there like this but they look so sad story oh they go Sy Thai I'll know now I can see why that would be a problem also like when I see people I can see if there is serpent or not you know how they say The Reptilian like I told my kids it's the hardest thing is David Icke type shit I really do see him to believe him he's gone down the rabbit hole that guy real deep into the core of the Earth but I was born on Twitter to is DM and people go and you've lost it like I did it and I used to do these fake phone prank phone calls before I got that star 69 and I was married to what's-his-face then the elf and he came in the room there and he told me to stop doing it and he looked at my Facebook and I was I was calling General Schwarzkopf to do it to him and he's like she don't crank call General anyway so was I saying but then I went to the DM you know I want you too. That way I'll just go come on you're losing it major world figure is really secretly reptilians my kids here so I told my kids just the hardest thing I'll ever tell you but and I didn't know so I couldn't help it at the time but I recently found out that your dad is reptilian but I sort of a joke but they are half a joint but I can see like people becoming a reptile like I'll see him and their head goes off like this show like on TV there had their net goes out like this and then the tongue comes out of the corner so I don't like that they do it I see it on TV all the time all them devil worshippers will worship parties here they're talking about in Hollywood if I did was a devil worshiper puppet called little hobo and he would do this this hilarious bit at the end of his comedy show where little hobo was his grandfather's puppet and his grandfather died and his grandfather's Last Wish for that he bring little hobo on stage with an one more time in the pop come to life with little hobo sounds funny Antoine lavoisier's grandson was getting married an ounce Duncan to perform at his party so me and a bunch of my friends all went to see Duncan perform at this bizarre Satanist party it was very strange Hollywood concert and Hank the third Hank Williams the third perform there and it was kind of fun but it was bizarre and so there's like a picture with me and the guy and people same as Satan worshiper now to say to someone who loves you intellectual can't text I promise you no no Satan worshipping no no worshiping.
