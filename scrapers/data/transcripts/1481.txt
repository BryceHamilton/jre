My guest today is a very good friend of mine. For many, many years he I've known him since he used to work at the Tempe Improv way back in the day. And he is the man who came and got me and brought me back to the Comedy Store. He is the talent coordinator of the Comedy Store, and he's just an awesome guy. I always love talking to him. We'd planned on doing this for a long time and he's got a crazy life story and at the end it gets real weird.  I love him to death.  Please give it up for the great and powerful Adam Egert girlfriend podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience Train, My Day Job podcast, my night all day and on motherfucking yet another good to see my friend to see you.  Thanks for having me on, please. I'm excited to see you, dude.  I haven't seen anybody I know. It's like your long lost friend. Like it feels that way. Yeah. But it also feels like you're literally like the only person I've seen.  I know you haven't left the house. Not much. I go out on daily walks. Oh no. That's not good for the mental health. I'm not good at all. How are you feeling?  All right. Yeah, I'm OK. Watching a lot of Korean baseball and why Korean baseball? It's the only live sport available. Oh, they're playing in Korea. Oh, it's wild. There stands this. You know, stadiums are empty, but they have like cardboard cutouts. Oh, no, they don't.  Cheerleaders with masks. Really. It's hilarious.  Oh, wow. But it's great. It's fun. That's so weird. Yeah. So they used cardboard cutouts in the audience.  Yeah. Oh, that's like the front where the cameras are behind home plate. Oh that's too strange. Hilarious.  I think I saw that in a movie once there was a baseball movie and you could clearly see that there was cutouts because if you ever seen what happens when they take old movies and then they poured them over to like Blu ray now.  Oh, that one of the best example is aliens. The second. That's my favorite action movie of all.  It's great fucking movie. Yeah, it's a great fucking movie.  I don't think it's as good a horror movie as the original one. Not a horror movie. Because the first ones of harm. Yeah, that's James Cameron. It's just fucking guns blazing. It doesn't stop. Never stop.  The most adrenaline fueled movie I've ever seen from beginning, and it just keeps progressively getting more intense and more intense.  And you know what's great about those movies? The hero is a woman and no one gives a fuck because they're so good. There's no there's no like. Oh, yeah, it's a diverse movie. It's amazing for women at the moment for.  No, yeah.  No, it's just Sigourney Weaver being a fucking badass, fighting the most evil monster movies have ever created.  Fuck. Yeah, that's about. Yeah I love it.  I love that kind of like gender equality when it's just equal because it's awesome and nobody even brings it up. Exactly.  Linda Hamilton and later turf like. Are you fucking kidding me bro. We need to bring it up. She's doing this, you know. Can't you see her fucking back just going to fucking kill you? It's amazing. Yeah. I mean, that's what I look like. You watch Ozark.  No, I tried. I watch the first four episodes and I do.  OK, so get back into the two scariest bitches are women the two scariest ladies in the show. OK, there's two scariest people on the show are two women, not Laura Linney.  No. Oh no.  But she's fucking great too. She's great. It never gets scary too. Oh, is she's kind of scary to the decisions they're willing to make. That's funny. Linda Hamilton, do a fucking run. This is pretty cross bitches. There was no Crossfade back then. She was a god damn pioneer. She's like, I'm not going to fucking die.  I had a huge crush on her. And in the second one, she terrified me.  She was so fucking awesome. She's fierce. Well, she became more fierce, right? She adapted to the world of the Terminators, which doesn't seem that far off from where we're at right now.  We're like closing in on Terminator finitely to this fucking article I was reading today about a bionic eye that will be available in five years that will be superior to a biological eye. That's insane. Insane within five years. And I was going to send it to Michael Bisping. Yeah, that's how. How do they even make black mirror anymore? We're already surpassed that's what the Black Mirror guy said. He's like, I'm not even doing the season, I can't do it.  The world's too absurd. Yeah, but my friend Michael Bisping, he's a former UFC middleweight champion.  He's from, like, Manchester. Yes, exactly.  He's one eye is a super fucked up. He's had several detached retinas to the point where it's basically blind. He barely can see anything out of one eye from fighting fire. He's a beast. Bionic eye could offer perfect sight night vision within five years.  Motherfucker, this is only going to get us, man. Between Elon Musk and these eyeball people, you're going to be half human, half human in five years. This is five years because five fucking years from now, they're going to have a human eye that you could like if you lose your eye. Like Dan Crenshaw, he's going to be the first president with a fiber of bionic eye. He's going to have a bionic eye.  He's going to have a fucking artificial super.  That's insane. What happened with the cardboard cutouts, you said when they transfer to Blu ray?  Yeah, well, that's that's marijuana talking for you.  Had a long career in baseball, a bionic eye and like two minutes.  So this is the cutouts they're showing us the cutouts in Korean baseball and soccer. They got in trouble because they use the sex dolls.  Oh, that's not good. Why? First of all, this if this is in America, everybody be triggered because it's all white lettering on red like. No, Magga, they're Magoffin.  Yeah, robot drummers. It's intense. It's wild. It's like the NFL. But baseball. Yeah, seems very strange. It's hilarious.  So anyway, I watched aliens on Blu ray, OK, and it's so terrible. Why not the movie itself.  Yeah, there's there's one scene where the spaceship is in the foreground and in the background. It's supposed to be like, you know, some space type shit. Sure.  It looks so bad because it was just a painting, right? It's in that part. Yeah.  And because the way they were focusing, you barely could see it. So it's fine in the film when he was watching it in low def. Yeah. On his monitors. It's like perfect. Looks great, but in high def it looks so fake.  That makes so much sense. They created and you know, based on the technology available at the time.  Yeah. You shouldn't watch those movies enhanced. They should just keep them with the original, the original resolution. It's really kind of stupid to do that because there's stuff they made decisions, man, back when special effects weren't the same thing. They made decisions. Exactly. And they were good decisions.  Yeah, it's hard to watch some of those in high def, if you like, ruining the movie. Yeah. It takes you out of the whole thing.  Yeah, it does. It's there's there's something also there's something about when they colorize that Gone with the Wind.  Oh he's like hey what are you doing. You're not supposed to do that. I know you don't have to.  Yeah. It's ridiculous. Like Colorize Schindler's List. It's like what are you doing. Yeah.  It's like you forgot what color addresses. You forgot what a red dress looks like. But I know what a dress looks like. I'm this is a time capsule, right. There is a time cap. Exactly.  Yeah. The Twilight Zone.  Twilight Zone is my favorite television show of all time. I've seen every episode at least five times.  I would agree with you and specifically because the fact that it came first. But I put I put Black Mirror in that league black market is so good.  It's so good. Do you have a favorite Black Mirror episode? Yes.  The one that you and I watch again and added the museum black.  I was a fucking. That was terrified. Damn that was good. So good. That and crocodile crocodile was very underrated.  Very, it was very terrifying.  Terrifying because you could see like a good person making these choices and these choices accelerate to the point where. Great. Oh yeah.  That's such a good show. That was a great one. I loved I loved the Star Trek one. I know. Oh, very good.  So well done. Very good. Very creepy man. Very, very possible. Right. Like all of it.  If the Trump won, there's so many. They had the it was a bad episode but it was it came true. It basically I didn't see the Trump win. It was like Waldo.  It was like this puppet. It was like this cartoon. There was like this mascot who became president. And you see this outlandish like I haven't seen them all. I haven't seen them.  He hardly the problem is, he said outlandish shit over the course of X amount of years. And if you like, dissect it, it's like he's just spouting off all day long. The way they do it is they take you out of context and then they change what you are. Right, because if if you're a guy like Trump who does say ridiculous shit sometimes, particularly before he was ever president.  So, yeah, but a lot of people do, you know, it's it's called talking shit. Yeah. And it's what a lot of people do right now. You can't do that if you ever going to be a president. Yeah.  But if you just take all of those talking shit moments and condense them together and go, this is hey, I'm like, oh my God, this is a monster. But nobody's like that all day people, Vassili. Yeah, yeah, yeah, there is someone you know, sometimes the Internet really does does some great work. And yesterday I saw somebody spliced together that great sound bite of him suggesting that they inject humans with with Clorox.  So, yeah, maybe I'm not a scientist, but maybe we do that. And then there's this great clip with Jim Downey and Billy Madison. I don't know if you remember, we were watching that really recently.  So funny. So he's talking all the shit about maybe we can inject it into people. I'm not a scientist, but I don't know, maybe something there.  And then it cuts to Jim Downey and he's like he's like nowhere in your incoherent ramblings. Have you said anything that makes any sort of sense? Because everyone in this room is now infinitely dumber for having listen to it awards, you know, points and may God have mercy on your soul.  Well done.  Beautiful videos that people will post up as a response to things.  And it's just like he gives a shit when someone says that a great one with Hannah Gadsby cut with like audience. I guess I shouldn't talk about that. Oh, I know what you're talking about. The Apollo nine at the Apollo. Yeah.  Woops, yeah. That one. That's crazy. Yeah, that video's hilarious.  I mean, the Internet's undefeated. Yeah, man, I missed the Comedy Store too for people don't know who's this Adam guy. You are the man who got me to come back to the Comedy Store. You came to the Improv. I appreciate it. That's true. It was my improv goal.  It was two things that happened. The first one was you coming in the improv and talking to me and explaining to me things are different.  And then all the old people know each other for a long time. But we knew each other from Tempe. Yeah.  And then the second thing that got me to do it was Ari, when Ari was having a special there, dude, that was the hardest I ever worked to get them to greenlight that special.  It was so important to me because we love we love to death.  Ari is to me I mean, I've known Ari since he was a doorman at the Comedy Store. We became friends when he was a doorman. He was just starting out. And to see him go from being a doorman to film in his special at the Comedy Store was like, I have to be there.  Even if I have to swallow my pride, I have to be there. So he was filming on a Wednesday, so I went on Tuesday just so it wouldn't shock my system and I could just appreciate his filming.  Nice. So I came down Tuesday. It was roast battle and I was like, holy shit.  And Jeff Ross gave me this crazy introduction at Roast Battle. And, you know, that was the first time I was at the Comedy Store in seven years.  And, you know, and then I was I was seeing how creative everybody was. Like the roast battle thing was so, so different because it's obviously like jokes that these guys had to write about each other. Yeah. So it's like it forces you into writing jokes. It takes away the one thing that fucks most comedians is that they don't write. So when you're forced into a battle like you're going to have to do battle next Tuesday with this girl and this girl's vicious, like you got to come up with some mean shit to say about her.  Really funny. And she's writing some shit about you. You already know that she's going to have some shoot.  I it's not my style. I don't do comedy. Like that's a different muscle. Yeah. It's a different it's just a different. I'm too mean in real life.  Like I don't want to turn that on for comedy. I don't like that part of me. I keep that part locked away.  So but I when people get real mean and nasty with each other I'm like Jesus. I get makes me uncomfortable but laugh at the same time. But it's just not I don't have that thing in me. I'm not interested in that. That but that style is even though it's brutal and it's everyone agrees, like everyone knows what they're doing to each other. And then I love how Brian has everybody hug it out. It's great. It's amazing.  It is. And he's the perfect host for it, too. You know, he's he's so friendly.  He's just so likeable. He's charismatic. He's he he is the perfect host for that.  Yeah. And it's just like the whole thing was when I was there, I was like, man, this is just so different. It was it's a wildly different club.  When when when the old talent coordinator left, it was like it was just a complete 180.  Everything just started. You were the catalyst for the truly great years that we've we were able to experience before this this epidemic but or pandemic.  But it was you could see everything starting to shift a little bit with roast battle.  And and then when Tommy left, it was like the floodgates opened. We were able to get rid of some of the old blood and some of the were weighing the lineups down.  But you coming back was everything. I mean, that was so baffling to me when I first came to the Comedy Store about ten years ago, because I remember hearing about the beef and everything.  And then I'm like, where what happened? And when I heard about what happened, I was like, how is this allowed? How did this happen? So I knew when I took over, I was like, I don't care what I have to do. And like, you made the decision all on your own. All I did was, was say, hey, give it a shot, you know, come down at least just to visit different seem like a different world back then.  You know, it's just a different world.  And then, you know, after the old guard was kicked out, it was like an exorcism. Like the moment I came back to the place, I was like, this is a different place. It's not even the old Comedy Store, because in the seven years, it had kind of gone through a new rebirth.  You know, I think that place goes through cycles. When I came there in the 90s, it was dog shit. It was terrible.  Tell me about oh, my God, it was terrible. It was terrible.  Except for when the greats would show up, like every now and then, like Martin Lawrence would show up. Every now and then, Damon Wayans would show up every night, their prime in their prime murderers. Dude, I've never bombed harder in my life than following Marlon excuse me, following Martin or following Damon following either one of them or Marlon Shit or Tommy Davidson back to where he was. Great. Oh, my God.  Dude, dude, Tommy Davidson used to murder everybody murdered, but there was only like a few and they wouldn't come that often.  So it was like when Martin would come, the main room would be flooded with people just pouring out into the hallways.  Like people forgot how big Martin Lawrence was in those days. This is the leather jumpsuit days. Sure. The you so crazy days, bro. He was on top of the world. He was king of the world for sure. He was on top of the world. People forgot. They forgot how hard he murdered to. He was so good.  The hardest decision I ever had to make was one day Martin Lawrence and Chris Rock showed up at the same exact time and they both wanted to go up and I had to decide who was going to go on.  That was a tough one. How long ago was this?  This was about a year ago, yeah, year and a half ago. That's a hard one, you know. Yeah, but they should work that out. Yeah, right.  That's not it shouldn't be too hard for you. Yeah, there's two of them. I mean I would go go ahead man. I'll go after you. I want you to do exactly. Yeah I want to, I don't want any beef.  And with those two guys like they're both legends, you know, they're both legends.  When I used to follow Martin Lawrence, man, I got a developed like this ability to accept the fact that I was going to eat shit and not be so scared because I had gotten beaten down a bunch of times by those crowds. And that was the brilliance of of Mizzi.  She knew that, you know, it was a tough spot. You know, she just put me on after Marlantes every time she was on the lineup, like Martin Lawrence. You do forty five minutes and that'll be Joe Rogan. Mike, do you ever see that video online where there's these Nigerian guys or these African guys, rather, and it's at a funeral and when the music starts playing, they go to these guys and then there's a guy getting knocked out.  And then when the guy gets knocked out, like you go back to the guy's dancing with the coffin. It's a funny meme in my circles.  You know, I'm talking about I just saw it. I think Donald Trump's account posted a clip of Biden saying that stuff. Charlamagne Oh, no.  Does the Biden account going into the like oh, please, please, please see if you can find that who posted it? Donald Trump himself think it was Donald Trump, Snapchat.  So whoever controlling my office, he's running. So that's you in the coffin every time you have to.  I said after mine, I would eat shit, I would eat shit and everybody would leave. I love that about me too.  That she would do that. And if you ever once said anything about having to do it, she would put you on ten times more right after the same. Oh, she put you on to one in the morning.  People say like, oh, you don't want that spot. OK, I'll put you on at one in the morning. You fuck. I wish she would yell at you too.  And people that have beef, she would always put you one after the other. People that were dating and break up.  Yeah, I love that about her fucking love that.  Will a that's how you treat it as a real gem because like that's where you would get that real workout in is the emotional pang's.  Well it's also like as a comic, you got to learn how to come out of the gate when people don't know who you are and you have a lot to prove and you're going on after someone who is a legend. So it's like you you have to develop that ability to follow those folks because in a normal club, you would get a chance, right? You'd go on stage. It'd be easy. No one killed before you just stroll out there.  How's everybody doing? Right. Good looking crowd. Let me tell you something about my day. And you could kind of go into it like, you know, ease into it.  But after Martin Lawrence crushes bro, you got to come with some strong shit right out of the gate. There's only like twenty five people going to stay no matter what. Exactly. No matter what you do. I always watch masses of people just lift off their chairs and leave the room.  Just no one stayed. Yeah.  I don't get fifty percent of your set is just resetting the room. Yeah. And how do you even. Good God, the first five minutes is you learn how to eat shit.  These are this is Donald Trump. This is actually Donald Trump Snapchat.  And he put this, this is these are these guys right here this and it comes to this fucking music. There's so many knockouts.  Here it is. You got more right to it if you have a. Problem, figuring out whether for Mayor Trump and you ain't black. And it's them carrying the coffin. This is Biden for president of the president, tweeted that. Yes, of course he did.  Look, did he knows how to use the Internet and his son knows how to use the Internet? Donald Trump Jr., they use him for all the wild shit when they need to post something really wild.  They go to Don Junior's Instagram. That's fucking great.  Listen, man, they're playing dirty. Everybody's playing dirty. Yeah, everyone. The world playing dirty. They're all pretending you're someone who not lying about this.  No one's going to be honest. It's just about creating impressions and memes and getting these short attention span motherfuckers to hold on to a narrative as hard as possible.  Russia, Russia gave Russia whatever it is we ask people, they're upset.  They don't even know what happened. That's 90 percent of the people out there, man, we live in.  And now it's going to be even weirder because everybody's going to be so stressed out because the economy's in the shit. Yeah. And it's not going to get out of there any quick any time soon. It's going to take some time. And what's going to happen?  I mean, this is like is this going to be class war? Because because the people that can afford to stay home. Yes. They want everyone to go out and get the economy going like they're super rich. Yeah. They don't give a fuck about people dying. They can stay in their mansions.  There's that aspect of it. There's also the and those are the ones that I don't think are looking at it correctly in terms of like the actual danger of the virus. But then there's other people that are like, hey, I don't wanna lose my business. Why don't you restart the economy? So I could take a chance. I'd rather take a fucking chance. I'm losing everything. I'm ninety nine point nine nine nine nine nine nine nine percent. You're going to fucking survive this, right?  You know, and I'm going to I'm going to know what's coming. I'm going to take a lot of vitamins, like let me do what I have to do and let's let's quarantine the people that are in danger. Let's quarantine old people. Let's keep them away until it goes away. Yeah. Let's quarantine sick people. And this is what we need to do.  This is what needs to be done, not lock the whole fucking country down. And once they do that, man, they don't want to undo that.  I don't know when Riesen left the world, but in so many different metrics of the world, is that what it was? Twitter, I mean, with there's just no reason almost anywhere.  Well, I think the reason is to save lives. It's just not a it doesn't make sense. Doesn't work.  Right. Because because you're losing lives with everything. Do there's an article that can't find out this is true. There's an article that I was reading in The Washington Examiner. One of those is a weird newspaper. And it was like it's it's one of those ones like what it is.  What kind of is this a biased like what what is the bias of The Washington Examiner? But it's basically saying that there's more people dead from suicide in Northern California than the war from coronavirus deaths during the during the lockdown, because people are fully in despair.  They're losing everything. They're going bankrupt and they don't see any way out of it.  Well, if it wasn't for Korean baseball, I would be fucking blown my fucking head off.  I've watched so many movies. Yeah, I mean, I've watched everything. Just everything.  Everything, not really everything. I still haven't seen the new Adam Sandler movie, the Diamond movie, Uncut Gems. Oh, that's my favorite. That and Once Upon a Time in Hollywood were my two favorites that year.  I have, you know, two young girls and I can't really watch fucked up movies with them.  So I got yelled out for watch an alien with one of them, which the first or first one I could.  Well, yeah, maybe maybe the first, John, I was like, come on, I'd watch it.  My mother my mother had me watch those movies when I was really little.  Like she watched scary movies with me.  Oh, the first scary movie I ever saw was The Shining.  So it is a true sadistic bay. A doctor seeing more suicides during coronavirus stay at home order that one hospital, though.  Oh, so they reported it and said it's the whole area. So see that.  Good for you, Jamie. That's real news. That's real news, folks. That's how you're supposed to do it. You're not supposed to lie and read the statistic. All fucked up, right?  You know, sometimes people do things like that and you're like, oh, you can't do that.  I just feel like maybe it was something you said. Oh, fuck, I can't remember. There's no wheat in this now. OK, zero, this is just 25 milligrams of CBD in some delicious killed. Cliff. Mango. Goodness.  Well, then I'm just fucked hard. It happens, bro.  When do you think we'll be able to start up shows again?  I really hoping in July. I feel like I know, but it's. But but realistically, I think July I.  What would you think about opening up a comedy store in Austin, Texas?  I mean, that would do really well, I think. I think it really would. Yeah. I love conversations I've been having on the phone lately.  I did reconnaissance this weekend and flew to Texas. Yeah.  Oh, shit. Yeah. Do you know Charlie, do you know the guy who runs the you know, Charlie, the guy who runs South by Southwest comedy. You know, he'd be a good guy to talk to. Probably.  I just talk to comedians. That's great. Yeah. I mean, I don't need to talk to anybody but the comics. I just feel like there's a lot of people in Austin. There's a million people. They have two good comedy clubs right now.  Capacity's a great room. And then they have the velvet room, which I've never done. But I hear really good things about. And I don't know if they have anything else. How many?  I think that's it for every time I watch Southwest a couple different times for Comedy Week, and it's just been insane.  It's a great town. Yeah.  I just think there's a real problem with first of all, the volume of humans here is unmanageable and there's a real problem with the government telling us what to do here. Doesn't these things don't make sense. And here's here's the best example. They recently decided to open it back up for movies, for movies and television production.  OK, but not for churches. Well, it's like, wait a minute, what what are you saying? Like, you can't. How about give a church 25 percent capacity, just like you would the other businesses?  And that's what we're talking about. For some reason, balance have more than one service in the day. Like, you don't have to just it doesn't doesn't make sense if some things can do their job and you call them essential businesses and some can't.  If you're saying that film production is OK, but here's a here's a weird one. You can't have Alcoholics Anonymous meetings, but liquor stores are essential businesses since it's so fucked up.  That's fucking crazy. So fucked up. Curry Adam Curry told me that. And when I read it, I was like, oh, no.  And there's logic to the essential business part of the liquor store thing because look, man, people are freaked out.  They need something to calm them down if they can't get any booze at all. Qiqi get really bad in the hospitals, need the beds. So when people detox off alcohol, it's very dangerous. Yeah, that's actually how Amy Winehouse died. She died from detoxing from alcohol. It's a hard fucking fall, too. So they need the hospital beds. They can't have people detox and whatever is dying of covid and then people get so they sent sense to me they deemed it an essential business.  But fucking Alcoholics Anonymous, man, you got to keep that open.  Yeah, I got that open. I do. As an Alcoholics Anonymous Zoome call once a week and most of them are fucking terrible man. You got to have got to be.  That can really help the same as you know, my kids are going to zoom school. You got to be. And it's, you know, it's not the way to do it. It's just you've got to be in person with people.  I'm telling you, that's the fucking worst. Oh, yeah. Have you seen some of the stand up Zoom's. Fuck that.  Oh, that is ridiculous.  Oh, that's like pretending you're in a swimming race in your living room. I'm swimming. Come on the floor swimming. But you're not swimming.  You're not to comedy. You're you're fucking doing something weird, man, because you wish you could do comedy.  It's so bad. It's so painful to watch. Timing is everything and it kills the timing. You have no energy, no audience, no like no no bueno.  Not stand up. No it's not. Stand up. Phoenix is holding shows again. Wow.  Phoenix has full nightclubs again. Jesus. Yeah. Floyd Mayweather was spotted at this Phoenix nightclub. No masks on in the whole place.  Bumper to bumper with people really. Again, balance. I feel like maybe let them do it.  Let them do it. That's what I say. Let them do it. Listen, man, this is not what we thought it was going to be. It's not killing people at the rate we thought it was going to. We would have never signed up for this. We thought it was really going to kill zero point one percent of the population that like that catch it. And you realize how many people catch and don't even know they had it.  And then you look at the average age that people are dying from it. It's literally older than the average age people die.  Oh, well, then the whole thing makes no sense. This is not something you shut the economy down for. We thought it was we thought it was going to be a terrible thing that was going to wreak havoc. And they'll point out like individual cases of people that are that are really young or healthy and something goes wrong with them. One hundred percent. Yeah, that's terrible. But we should just be careful. Doesn't mean we should keep everything shut down.  And it's rare that these people exist, these these young people that get sick that you hear about this is not normal.  Why are we in a situation then? Why? I don't know, man.  I mean, we're going to see how how these other cities that have opened up do and how that goes and then and then reevaluate.  This is a very conservative state in that regard. I mean, it's very liberal, but it's very conservative in the regard of, like, how they're approaching this this thing. They're doing it very slowly and very deliberately. You know, I don't I don't agree with it. I just think at a certain point in time, you have to adjust. It is not what we thought it was going to be. You thought they were going to be hundreds of thousands of people dead in this state.  There's only two thousand people dead. But people are dying from all kinds of shit all the time. We can't just focus on one thing, because while this is happening, people are dying in this state of tuberculosis, lung cancer, liver cancer, they're dying.  So do you think this is a political thing? I don't know, man. Keep the economy back.  No, I don't think so. I don't think I've heard that crazy conspiracy theory. I don't think that I think it's a matter of first of all, there's a lot of people that are legitimately scared. Yeah. I mean, I talked to kids. Parents don't, you know, that don't want the kids going back to school in September. They're just people legitimately scared.  They think it's going to get worse because everybody's kids at home. I can't open it up. You open the fucking schools immediately for children.  It's very rare that it's fatal, very rare that it's fatal.  But the flu is far more fatal. The flu is far more fatal, fatal for children.  Oh, and during flu season, we willingly let kids go to school. We don't even think about it. Yeah, right. Yeah.  You have to think about if you're really worried about children, the flu is far more deadly. Now, this is not dismissing the deadliness of this disease is a terrible disease. Michael Yo got it. And he almost died. But a lot of things happen to Michael Yo. He flew all the way to fucking New York with no sleep. He did radio, did all kinds of shit. He did shows there no sleep, flies back and then drives from his house to Vegas and then back with his family in the same day.  Then he has two days of auditions, plus his vitamin D deficient. Oh, well, so, yeah, I was thinking all this. I was like, well, Michael Yo is strong. Guy is healthy and vibrant. Like if that guy got sick from it.  Oh my God, this is scary. Vitamin D, no vitamin D and vitamin D deficiency is something.  And like 70 percent of the population, 70 percent of the people in this country are vitamin D deficient.  First thing I did when I when I saw we were going to be quarantined, I ordered a shit ton of vitamin D online. So I take some every day. I try and go out in the sun every day because, yeah, I don't want this fucking thing. I think I had it. I think I had it.  Everybody was they had it. I really I never had a cough like this in my life where I was wheezing.  I could barely breathe. And the doctors were baffled. They took chest X-rays, had it for three weeks.  But who fucking knows? I doubt it. I thought I did it to anybody test and figure it out.  I thought I had it. Didn't even feel it.  That makes sense. If there's anybody I could think of that would have it and not be able to feel it would be. You know, I'm pretty sensitive to that kind of stuff.  But I also, by the way, on fucking Spotify. Thank you. Holy shit. I know. So well deserved, man. Thank you. God damn.  Yeah. I'm sorry. I didn't want to forget why I didn't want to fucking forget. Yeah. Dude, I've been ultra paying attention to my health while this is all going on. That's one thing that's helped a lot. Like while this is going to be you have a really like I'm in the sauna every day.  Twenty five minutes, every day. No excuses, like super regular workout routine superego with my vitamins, super regular with everything just being really on ball because it made me you can't take your health for granted.  And that's a simple statement that sort of just bounces around the room like a beach ball doesn't mean anything.  This puts it in perspective. Yes, this puts it in perspective. There's no doubt about it.  And in the beginning, people were less country to. I don't know if you noticed. Yeah. Because they were really worried they were going to die. Yeah. And so things meant something you don't want to remind me of.  It was it was like the week after 9/11.  Everyone was real friendly with each other, super neighborly. And now it's like I go out and traffic people are cut.  But it's worse than 9/11 because after 9/11, people went back to normal. Now they're going to go back from all this niceness. They're going to go back to being a cunt and there's no work. Yeah, and then they're angry, you know.  And you were saying something important earlier. You said we could fall into some sort of a class warfare type situation.  Yeah, it is terrifying.  And I don't I don't think it had to be this way. And I don't think it has to stay this way. They're talking about not even opening up L.A. until July 4th, Fourth of July weekend. My came out like, why?  What's what's this is so arbitrary. And there's no talk whatsoever about strengthening your immune system.  None. Yeah. What the fuck? Like the most important things are just falling by the wayside. Like, I don't understand this poor government.  It's just poor leadership. It's poor leadership. That's what it is. It's leading only looking at one perspective and that's the perspective that enhances fear.  This is wear a mask. Where are your gloves? Use hand sanitizer, don't touch anything, stay apart from each other. And then the other perspective is get out in the sun, get your vitamin D, drink lots of water, stop drinking soda, check your vitamin levels if you can. But give yourself X amount of vitamin C a day, X amount of days. Take zinc. Zinc has been shown to have a very positive effect on people that people with high zinc levels are sufficient.  Zinc levels that have this virus also have a much better out.  That's all I take. Every morning I take one zinc, one vitamin D and two airborne. But you won't hear any of this shit? No, that's what I have to look it up.  I mean, people fucking they should be. Yeah, they should be pumping this into our fucking bloodstream to be in the news. But it's all bullshit.  It's all bullshit. When Ronda Patrick was talking about the vitamin D levels in people that are in ICU, it's like if you were a scientist, he'd be like, hold on, we found it.  Yeah, right. Right.  Kliment Eighty six percent of the people in the ICU are deficient in vitamin D and then four percent have sufficient levels of vitamin D, four percent. That's insane.  It's 80 something percent versus four percent like, holy fuck, holy fuck.  I don't understand, dude. It makes zero sense. It makes zero sense.  I wish that we could open the store tomorrow. Yes.  Like we should be able to open the original room and start out at 25 percent capacity, you know, and.  Yeah, well just what does it usually fit. One hundred and one hundred and fifty about. Yeah.  Just seventy five people to space it out. How about just getting everybody sign a waiver. Right. Just sign a fucking waiver. Let's do this.  I mean and if you, if you have a sick mom at home, if you have someone vulnerable at home, don't. Go out to these places, you're the one who should make the sacrifice, should be the whole world sacrifice. Exactly.  But we can't rely on these fucking assholes. So can you take a can is that they did it in the restaurant I went to in Texas.  I went to a real restaurant. So we'll just get one of those fucking shout out to the Lonesome Dove at this Lonesome Dove restaurant in Austin.  They take a fuckin thermostat. They put it here for it and they read, you're like, you're all good. And then you write in this thing, have you been in contact with anybody who has covid?  Have you had a fever? If you have a cold like symptoms and as long as you're clear on all that stuff, we should be doing that and call the they wear a mask.  They stay away from you. I mean, mostly, except they're taking your meal or dropping off your meal because we've already gone over the game plan ad nauseam.  We know exactly how we're going to do it.  You know how to have access to the bathrooms, social distancing in the room where the comics can enter the stage so they're not fucking in the thick of it. Yeah, we're ready to go. All we need is the green light. I don't know how the problem is.  They're never going to want to give that green light. I mean, they're going to have to give that.  I really like green light, but I'm worried about I will get a we'll get a percentage green light for one of the rooms.  I really think they're going to let you have half the belly. I think now I think which thirty people. I'll take whatever I know I'll take it down.  I never thought I'd miss that place that much. Yeah. Too. I miss it eventually.  Like it got to a point where I'm like I just want to fucking hide there because everybody wants something and I don't I got have shit to give. Right. You know. Yeah.  And that's a weird position as a talent coordinator for a comedy club where all the best comedians go to dance like everyone who's in town, whether it's Chappelle or Bill Burr, they're all there.  They're all there's no spots.  And then there's the one. And then there's you and Joey Diaz and you know, everybody else and Whitney Cummings and all the A plus there are there every single night when they're in town and they're in town.  Yeah, well. And then that leaves you, you know, and then from 11 to to 12, that's all the Anderson Tinos and the Eric Griffin's in the film in wars and all these other beasts that aren't filling fucking arenas, but they're still killers. The next one's up, you know.  So if you're some new guy or gal, that's like the line. Yeah.  That leaves like five spots a night. At the end of the lineup, you got two hundred and fifty comics calling in every week just that fit into that paradigm. So it's like, sorry, you know, it's not nothing personal. Yeah.  There's, there's no club like it, you know, no club ever been like it either where there's no shortage of people in the audience. I mean those years that I from when I came back to when the pandemic hit were the craziest years I've ever seen in stand up comedy at that place, by far like a like a whole new dimension, like a whole world had shifted.  It's it's been so fucking cool to watch, you know, and to see that shift. There are some comics that are coming up right now, though, some of the ones that I passed in the last year or two, I'm so excited about, like this guy, Brian Simpson, is you got a neck when we reopen again.  I'm telling you, this guy is a beast. He Sagara he opens up for cigarette. Oh, no, he's fantastic. Lara Bites, you know, is fantastic. Lars Rich Larrea.  She's she's hilarious. Krischer and I were in the back of the room watching her on stage like it was like the end of the night.  There's maybe like twenty people or something in the crowd. And more people were in the crowd by the end of her set than were there in the beginning because people were coming in because she was saying, that's so cool, dude, she's killing us.  Yeah, we had been around all night. We've been hanging there all night and it was late. Those are always the best sets.  Holtzmann closing out the main room when it's like nine people in the audience and twenty comics in the back of the room.  That's where Kinnison used to do spots.  I mean, that's the Cissé. Like people would come to see him. They would start showing up at twelve o'clock. Yeah.  And that's where I put Brody. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I see. My trunk is still filled with all of his shit. Really. What do you guys. I had to clean out his whole apartment. You have his kettlebell. I might.  You want to. Yeah. If I, if I have the kettle do I definitely have some drumsticks. Whatever you want. We'll go out there afterwards in garage.  We work together in Tempe and he was doing cleans and pressies in the parking lot staying fit.  I remember that. That's when he used to do it. But you might remember me from the made for TV ad hoc movie.  Yes, it was the best push Posidonia. We went to a little league together.  Did you really? I grew up in Tarzana. He grew up in Tarzana when he was one of the older students.  But yeah, Joe took a little baseball camp. Wow.  Yeah, I'm a step mother fucker.  I'm a motherfucker to you.  He was another thing about that place, like the special quality of that place, like you're going to run into Brody Stevens and any other walk of life, like you had to meet that kind of comedy, especially to get to know him.  Like the way we got to know Brody.  Yeah. You know, yeah. You take it for granted, you know. Yeah, well, you really do.  And you really know. You do now like I kind of knew I took it for granted. I'd leave that place some nights and I'd be like, how lucky are we that we have this place now because this place never existed? And for me it was like, you know, we're talking about the pandemic coming back from the pandemic. For me, it was like when I was gone and then I came back, it made me realize like, oh, this is a very valuable thing for your comedy.  Like, you can't just go to, like, random comedy clubs and just jump in Doucet's like having a home base and having a home base filled with like Jeselnik and all these fucking assassins'. It's like you just be around murderers just all day long sleighing, and it just makes everybody's level higher. I felt like the level of comedy that I was experiencing there was higher than I had ever seen it before. Like it was there was always the murderers like Martin Lawrence and Damon Wayans, but there was a lot of bullshit in there, a lot of fucking Botox and a lot of dudes who were doing literally the same act.  No bullshit for twenty five years. I know I had to get rid of a lot of it. There was dude, it was weird.  Like you would, you would see a guy in you not see him for ten, fifteen years and you'd see the same act in the same order verbatim with old like Ronald Reagan as president references and shit like, whoa, that was when I came here in 94.  There was a lot of that going on.  I believe it. So it was like nothing, murderers and then nothing and then the occasional murder. But it was like you get a one murder a night. Maybe it wasn't nothing like now.  I mean, I'm so fortunate to have the people calling in every week that they could call in because from nine o'clock till literally 12, 15, it's just wall to wall killers.  Yeah, we need to get the president involved in this. Tell him that he'll get the support of all the comedians. If you just has a federal mandate to open up all comedy clubs, we need it. It's an essential business.  It really is, though, essential business that's going to do wonders for for everybody's mental health, for sure it will.  And for all the mental patients that do stand up. I mean, what are they doing right now? They're bouncing off the walls and these fucking people, they're losing their minds so hard. They're doing some comedy. Dude, somebody talked him into it. I'm in my studio apartment. I'm Jack Torrance over there.  That's like my little Overlook Hotel. I don't think that's good for, you know, you're very social guy.  I don't think that's a good thing to be locked up like that for two months at a time, right?  Yeah. I can't wait to get out. Just take a chance at the bugs, go wander around out of the beach, put some faces.  You know, I you know, I've been talking to Norm MacDonald a lot lately.  We're going to I think we're going to start the podcast. Beautiful.  So thank God for that and get tested. You can bring him in here and get tested, too. Yeah. You know what, you know, we're going to house, I think we would kill for you to be the first guest. I would love to do. All right. I'm hundred percent and. Oh, God, you know, we have some good guests lined up.  So now we just we're just going to figure it out. Yeah.  So you're all set to get tested today, too. Oh, perfect. I know you don't have because you haven't gone anywhere. But you know exactly when you when you sit in your house like that for like all those days at a time, how that's got to be so depressing.  It's not great.  It's not great. It's really not. It's my Yeah.  My depression and anxiety through the fucking roof. Do you do any kind of exercise?  I got a rowing machine, so I do a lot of rowing and then I go on a long walk. I go on like a five mile walk every day.  Oh, that's very good. But that's it. Yeah, but you by yourself most of the time I'm by myself in my in my apartment. Yes. Shit that ain't good. Being by yourself that often is not good.  No. All the single people. This is a fucking weird one for single people.  Well it's kind of choose your poison. I don't know how I feel like I would fucking want to kill somebody if I was stuck in a in a single room.  Yeah, that could happen for sure. Oh absolutely. Yeah, that can happen for sure.  It either brings you closer together or drifts you further apart.  Those are those that have a strong foundation. You truly like each, you know what I mean. You to know each other, accepted each other for everything, warts and all.  And also you, you both realize like like you're saying you appreciate the store. You also appreciate your family, appreciate your friends. I appreciate my friends and my family and just everybody in my life.  Way more now than I guess I, I guess I always appreciated them, but there was like a another 10 percent bump and all that stuff when the pandemic was happening because like one started happening in the beginning, I was like genuinely scared. I was genuinely thinking this could be something that kills 10 percent of the people I know was genuinely thinking like, oh my God, this could be way worse. China could be lying about how bad it is, can be way worse.  I remember talking to you about right. When you were in that state of mind. Yeah. And it was terrifying.  But what made me it made me think in that state of mind, like, I'm so thankful that I have such an amazing group of friends, so thankful that I have an amazing family, so thankful that I have friends that I love, that we can fuck with each other and talk shit to each other.  You know, it's like that, my son, one of the greatest joys of my day. I'm in a group thread with with a bunch of comics. And those are those are my favorite moments of the day, just cracking each other up.  And I'm through it with Whitney and Nick Swardson and Daliah. It's the most ridiculous thing that's been going on for years and years to the bitch group. Just bitching about shit. It's really funny.  I'm in a great one with with Spade and Whitney. It's just the vibe.  I think it is just it was a group text all day long talking shit.  It's funny, man. It's so fun with all of my heart. Oh, she's a radio person. She really is a very, very important to. Oh yeah.  He's amazing. Yeah. And deleted. So we're yeah.  We're very, very, very lucky. There's just a bunch of people that we know that are just some of the most fun people to be around. Yeah. And Irish iffier.  Yeah. That no matter where you go, you know, Jerry Sloan just died.  I hopefully learned his lesson and keeps his fucking mouth shut this time. You know, Jerry's not just the coach of the Utah Jazz.  Don't even mention it to. Ah, he probably doesn't know yet.  He knows that sort of a prank, that prank, the idea of that prank, it's like, oh, yeah, he's just absolutely committed to be in the wrestling.  He'll all the time he loves the shit.  I was reading that wrestling might go under. No, how they're saying that wrestling is they're firing wrestlers. I know they got rid of Cain Velasquez and he only did like one match with them. They're releasing a bunch of people off the roster and they're hurting apparently because they're not getting any liftgate.  You got to think pro wrestling when they tour around the country, the mean they're doing hundreds of shows, these giant places.  You imagine the amount of money just from the live gate of all these places and then merch all that different stuff. All that stuff's cut off. So they have the same amount of expenses. But then through no fault of their own, boom, profit stop.  I'm I'm genuinely ignorant about so many things in this world except for maybe music, movies and comedy. But here's what I don't understand. They've made a shit ton of money, haven't they?  Haven't they been balling? They're not saving. What are they, a Boy Scout? I thought this was like, yeah, he's on juice. It's the start of the year. He's saving money. No, I just watched the thirty four thirty on the SFL.  It was great.  That guy's doing squats and shooting fucking steroids and making billions of dollars he have any time.  That's true. My man is an animal. He's not saving any money. The guy probably is fifty bucks in the bank. He spends everything he makes, he makes one hundred million dollars a year, spends it all like it's going out of style a. Fucking animal, and you look at his business, though, like you've got, I believe, the way they have, you would be able knownas the app, their app, you get everything through that.  Every network. I think it's right.  So when you sign up, you pay a monthly fee and you get all the events. There's no pay per view. Right, right. Right. Whereas the UFC not the case, the UFC like if you get ESPN plus you got to pay for ESPN plus. But when like Conor McGregor fights or Jon Jones fights, you got to pay for that.  Yeah. I found out the hard work. What was that like three weeks ago. Yeah, yeah.  Yeah. That's, that's just how it is man. Yeah. That's just how it is. That's, that's how they don't they don't have the same model.  And a lot of people like you used to have that model. They used to have you pay for paper views. They have the regular shows and they have the big time paper views. Yeah, I remember that with like summer slam, even the W I remember they used to Yeah.  These to advertise those all the time on cable if you could imagine.  No. If like Tuesday night, Rochester, New York, Conor McGregor would just fight a championship fight and then you see him again on Saturday.  But that's a good point.  You would Ronda Rousey said about that, you know, she was like you fucking dorks. Listen, this is fake fighting and they do it two hundred times a year shows, you know, what happened. If you fought 200 times a year, you'd be dead.  Like, you know, she's a star in the WWE. At the end of the day, she was like the original great famous women's mixed martial arts fighters.  Taking your nonsense. Listen to that stupid shit. Shut the fuck up.  You know, I mean, she got knocked out by Cyborg and Amanda Knox, not Cyborg by Amanda Nunez's and Holly Holm back to back.  Right.  The idea that she's going to listen to some fucking wrestling dork, give a shit that business, though.  What I was going to say is I think Austin, because of the app, the. Oh, right. Because of the app, the way they have it set up, they don't have the live gate anymore. So all that money from those, they do these giant arenas, they're selling out like crazy all over the country. Two hundred plus a year, all that money's gone.  They can't just hit the fucking pause button. No man's got bills and he's got a jets, fucking one hundred houses.  He's got no time.  He's just I don't know. I don't know what to do. I mean, I think when the business drops, you got to act accordingly. I guess when the business comes back, they'll rehire people.  It's a hard time for everybody, man, but the people that I feel the most for are people who are dying and people like lost people. But next, people who are losing their business and their families falling apart because of this and through no fault of their own.  Yeah. And then the employees that are just forced to go out of work and they they have to go on food. Like, I don't understand how they're supposed to just quarantine for months with no money.  And again, no. Two hundred dollars and no talk at all about health taking care of your health. No talk.  That's just shocking. No talk. Yeah. That should be number one, two and three on the list. Yeah. It's fucking crazy what is going on.  I wonder if other countries are going to be fascinated to see how they're handling this and other countries on their news over there.  And while some countries aren't handling it badly at all, if some countries like Germany had a crazy low death rate. Right.  There's a bunch of countries that are really focused on that. I wonder if I'm their news programs they're focused on. Here's what you need to do to protect yourself. Take a lot of vitamin D, take this, do this, get it.  Yeah, I think it's probably their health care system and it's probably their diet. You know, there's a real issue in this country with sugar, and that's a giant part of what's happening here.  When you talk about people that are getting diabetes and, you know, people that are overweight, those are two big factors in this disease. Right. And they're both connected, not the genetic form of diabetes, but type two is connected to sugar consumption. Right. It's directly connected to your diet. You can you could also look at Azzedine Del Ray. Dean Del Ray had fucking diabetes when he because he was eating sugar all day.  He was doing Jamba Juice once a day. Yeah, it was candy. Yeah. Yeah.  He realized it when they gave him that wake up call, that diabetes wake up call a kind of hell of a wake up call.  But now you look at him, he's healthy and fit.  He looks better than he ever has lost a ton of weight. And he said he feels so good.  He looks Kelly. He looks great. Yeah.  And now like his Instagram posts, like you'll see quite a few of them every now and then we'll talk about sugar and what he used to look like. He'll put Fat Dean pictures on everybody.  Yeah, like fat dude. I got fat out him. I got fat. I'm photos. Oh that's right. You showed me. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. Those are solid. I didn't know you then.  You know, I was chubby at the improv. What was that.  I'm not twenty five. I'm not judging. I didn't even notice.  No you probably did know me when I was fat them.  Those were good days. Maybe a little bit. I let it go you know. Good. Thank you. I appreciate that. But Dean, he's a perfect example. I mean he was had all sorts of health problems because of that sugar consumption. Look, there's fat Dean with his. Yeah. He got his name on the store at the wall. The wall of the store, rather. Yeah.  Look at that fat dean, too. He did it. He looks like Bobby Hill. He used to do a bit about that. Wow, that's crazy. You know, Fatty was God damn, and now he's healthy and young. Yeah.  Sugar's looking back in time. It's a killer. No, he's getting younger. He looks younger. He does look way younger, younger, healthier. He looks so much better.  And that's my problem. I eat too much ice cream. Again, we're not hearing any of this stuff from people.  We're not hearing any of this stuff from Foushee or all these health experts. We're not hearing any of it. No, it's crazy to inject yourself with fucking Clorox.  And if you talk to people like, well, you don't want to shame people for, you know, for having a poor diet or for being overweight, like, OK, do you care if people die or not?  Yeah. What do you care about? Do you. Is it hurting people's feelings or saving their lives?  Everything's backwards now. Everyone's too sensitive. They're worried about people's feelings too much.  It's going to be real weird. When we come back to doing comedy and you hear all the covid jokes, it's going to be, yeah, that is going to be the nasty that's going to be a new airplane. I'm avoiding them. I'm not writing anything about who's going to build the wall. It's going to be the new fucking exactly when we get back. Yeah, exactly.  But. Wait, fuck you sure there's no weed in this 100 percent you probably got contacts from being in the room with.  No, there was something specific I was you had over there. You had like 30 days. How many days? 90 days off. 90 days. Yeah, I got sober on March 1st.  You can't be in a room with someone like me. I'm smoking. That's what I was going to ask you is do you think it's probably. No, no, I don't think so.  Do you think that social distance from weed smoke, do you think all the PC bullshit and the social justice warrior shit is going to be tempered after we. No, no, no.  I think it was tempered because the real danger I think the real threat and the real fear tempered. And now that that's gone away, the real fear is going to give way to a new level of anger because of this level of despair people are going to be experiencing financially over the next few months.  So there's going to be a heightened it's almost going to be like that was a slingshot effect, like people got less candy and they're going to get more content and more self righteous.  Oh, yeah, more more self righteous, more people chastising, criticizing people. And on Twitter, you really see it because people are literally forced to be at home.  So if you're forced to be at home and you don't have the discipline to stay off Twitter and you happen to comment something and someone comments on your comment and then you start talking shit to each other, that's your day is not your day, but you're going to be crazy like you're going to be thinking about in the middle of the night.  What the fuck did they write? You get up to pee. I'm not going to check my phone. Let me check my phone. Fuck. And they said something is pretty good. You like, God damn it. Not going to come up with something to say back. So you start Googling statistics.  Yeah, man. I mean, this is what a lot of people are doing. It's making people sicker and sicker. I have almost completely avoided Twitter other than check my DBMS occasionally and occasionally I'll check what other people have posted that I'm friends with or that I follow check a little bit, but I'm not give it. I might give it five minutes a day.  I deleted my Twitter icon about a year ago and then I just reinstalled it maybe about a week or two ago. And I was really starting to see, like, why am I doing why am I even looking? It's just getting me pissed off.  It's just too many people are angry. Yeah, it's just too many about nonsense. Well, maybe it's to them it's important, right? It's like when you post it, it's important.  But when you're dealing with whatever the fuck it is, one hundred million people that are on Twitter or more, probably more that are posting on a regular basis.  And then most of what they want to say is angry.  Most of what they want to say is negative. Most of his complaining might be like 60 percent complaining. Yeah.  So when you tune into that, you're getting all the problems of all these people. It's just too many people. You're supposed to deal with the problems, the people that are around you. So if there's like 10 people around you and Tom, he's got a problem. What's wrong with Tommy? Let's go talk to Tommy. It's not supposed to be 10 million people. Right? And then there's hundreds of thousands of Tommy just flooding your fucking your feed with bullshit.  Nonsense.  My fucking girls line about this and they say we can't vote in November. Fuck that. I say we sue and whoa, all this craziness. And it's like you just deal with the worst aspects of everyone's day or everyone's thoughts or everyone's opinions, you just dealing with all this negativity. And it's so rare that it's really very much appreciated when you do find it like a really well structured conversation or disagreement about something where people don't get shitty at all is like, wow, that's beautiful, that's pleasant to see.  Or there's people that want to dox people because, you know, you know, they don't like this politician that they support or they don't like. They want you to not have to wear a mask if you want to talk to you like this.  There's so many people that are so fucking angry and weird online and then you add this pandemic to it and you just got this boiling pot of shitty thinking.  And anger and meanness just mean, yeah, there's a lot of that, where's the love, where's the love, where's the camaraderie, where's the hugs? Isn't that the best part of your day when you rather be friends with people like I know you can have disagreements and not be shitty.  It's possible.  And that's what I loved about the Comedy Store as people that, you know, didn't disagree.  But they fucking you know, there's still the camaraderie and they're there at the end of the day, they're in the same boat like they love you pretty much. Yeah.  There's just there's a lack of conservative comedians, I would say, if there's anything that's odd.  Yeah.  That is I think that's very true. There's a few, you know, that you know of. But it's pretty it's pretty rare. I think there's probably more than we know that they're just just not on stage. They're avoiding it.  Maybe. Yeah, maybe in acting it's like fucking 99 percent. It's crazy. Yeah. Which makes me think that can't be real. It makes me think that it's probably a lot of it was people shaping their opinions so that they're more accepted and loved by the community that it's chosen to try to excel and definitely all business exactions.  I remember I had this conversation with this dude once I was on a TV set when I first started acting and Newsradio, you know, before that hardball.  Oh, OK. This is early in my acting career.  I was quite crazy. And I was talking to this dude about a movie.  I might have been news radio days because I think that's when this movie came out.  It was as good as it gets. Sure.  With Jack Nicholson, which I thought was the most fucking depressing movie, because I'm like, here's this lady and she's she's so nice.  And she keeps accepting this guy for fucking up over and over again.  And then the end, the solution is he takes a pill and the pill keeps him from being an asshole. Like what? There's a pill for that I like.  That's so crazy. I was so fucking asshole.  And we're supposed to think, oh, no, no, no, you just need a pill.  See, once he gets this non asshole a medium inside of his body, it cancels out all the asshole weirdness. And he's actually a good guy. So she found a good guy. Oh, she's poor lady, was a single mom, was living with this fucking mean piece of shit and a pill fix.  And I was like that movie depressed the fuck out of me.  And I was talking to this actor and he goes, I actually I think he had a lot to offer her.  I go, What? Because it was a popular movie.  He was like it was spouting off. It was terrible movie.  I wouldn't if that lady was your sister. When you want to grab a girl. Helen, come on. You're a this guy is so mean. Yeah, he's always mean. He says racist shit. He's mean. Yeah. He's cracking jokes. He's he was yelling at people. He did a lot of like weird shit.  He said he was a writer. Right. They said you write women so well I think of a regular woman and then I take away reason and accountability.  But it's not just that.  It was like, you know, he was misogynist. He was nice an asshole, but always a dick. But there was no nice no one in these whatsoever.  Right. So crippling OCD Gethers, I haven't seen didn't make any sense, but. Yeah.  Didn't make any sense. I'm like, oh depressing. I go look, it's a work of art, right. Doesn't have to be warm and fuzzy. I just but it made me feel bad. But he was like sticking up for the relationship. Oh that. I just sticking up for the movie but no.  Yeah that's insane. But I realized in the middle of the conversation like oh people do shit like that because they think they're supposed to like a movie.  So they say yeah, course that's what he was told was definitely because because I was look I was dumb. I'm dumb now. But back then I was I was I was like four years removed from fighting.  I was fucking dumb. Now then I'm fine.  I was I was much dumber them. But it was my instincts were always to challenge people on things like what? What are you saying?  Like, I was I wanted to I wanted to find out why he could ever possibly think that that was a good idea for that lady to date. That fucking asshole, that mean guy who just needed a pill. Right.  That's crazy. That's the craziest movie I remember that. I remember when the English Patient came out and everybody was all over. It was was like, this is the best thing ever. And I was like, that movie fucking sucked. But I wouldn't today if it came out today, I would have no problem being like, no, you're wrong. I bored the shit out of me.  It was weird. But my point was not that, you know, it was a good movie or a bad movie. He was the result.  He was just this is what my point was. I could tell he wasn't really saying it because he thought it. He was saying it because he thought it was the thing that he should say. Yeah. And in talking to this guy, I found this like it was like one of those fake houses where they film a TV show where there's nothing behind it.  It's propped up on sticks. And I'm looking at this guy behind that sign. Those like your fake personality, you don't even have a real personality. Who are you like, you're you fucking weirdo. And this is one one way you could tell these people, they would always say. Good to see you, even if they just met you, they say good to see, right? It was like a like like you're in a cult, like you're saying the things that everyone says and blessed be with you and blessed be with you, brother.  You pass each other. Always good to see you. Good to see you. And everyone was full of shit like this is the most disingenuous. Good to see you. Instead of saying, hey, what's up?  That's nice to meet you analogy. That is because I was in a cult. I know what it's like to fucking experience that.  Yes. That's why I'm bringing this up. I want to get to that. I know your cult story.  That is. Ninety nine percent of the industry.  That's why it's such a sad place. Yeah. That's why it's so sad and lonely and you get all that attention.  And believe me, that's what I wanted. That's why I came here.  I mean, I just figured out along the way what was wrong. I figured it out along the way, oh, this is a bad motivation.  This is not a good motivation like the best. This is not going to fix you. You have to fix you and then treat what you're doing as an art form and enjoy it instead of treat.  What you're doing is like a method of extracting attention, because that's the difference between someone who's an artist.  Right, Gary Clark Jr. versus someone who's just doing a lot of dumb shit to try to get attention and doesn't really have any thought to it.  I know exactly what you mean. And then there were a lot of comics that were like that at the Comedy Store that were doing it just to get women. And and they were they didn't have any real love for the art form.  They just wanted to be if they were working on their craft. They had the same set, like you talked about earlier, that they've been doing for a decade.  And they were just doing it to try and get women to try and get they wanted to get famous.  Yeah, it's just you you got to somewhere along the line fix what's wrong with you.  And you can do that and keep it growing as a person and keep just fixing what's wrong with you and concentrate on positive things. That are about this thing, there's a way to be healthy and still approach it and the way to be healthy and approaches approaches an art form, don't approach it as a method for getting you attention. And the problem is it's like set up to chase the attention, set up to chase the sitcom role or the record that you put out or the, you know, whatever.  The big thing is that that you get into the big thing that's supposed to elevate you and define you, you know.  And instead of that, I think if if you can, as you're evolving as an artist, reach a point where you're just trying to do your best work.  And that must feel so fucking good to reach that point, you're never really there. But to be never really there, to be adjacent, at least you're chasing it always.  You're like, right. You're running right alongside it. But you can never jump on its back.  If you're adjacent to that, you just keep trying.  You know, it's really a numbers thing and a lot of ways and an attention thing and a focused thing. You know, people want to say it's a talent thing. Talent is a weird thing.  It's like a lot of like for standup, you you've developed a personality long before you ever thought that it was an asset in a career like you, just Joey Diaz was just a person.  That's right. I'm saying.  Yeah, but like, if you are a regular guy who works in an accounting office and you know it, is that an accountant?  No, impossible. But if you were like a real calm guy who is like, I've always enjoyed standup comedy, I want to give it a try. And you go to like these open mic nights and the week that and you meet that savage, you're like, oh, my God, that guy's a real person. Like this guy exists to like, I got to quit now, you know, like he's that's different.  Like that advantage.  He's like done some cross training, like life, like getting arrested and kidnapping people and all the coaches, solid crosscutting like comedy cross training, like Joey Diaz, like he'll have such a massive advantage over any normy.  Yeah. Like even if a norm he's got really good jokes, like he's just always lived in it.  It's that personality element is something you can't teach.  Right. You know, you got to figure that one out. That's I think that's one of the most important things in standup is authenticity to me. I feel like that's a huge thing. Yeah.  I feel like it's hypnotism. I really do. I could see that. Yeah. I've always had this idea before I was ever hypnotized. Then my friend Vinny Shoreman, he's a hypnotist, he hypnotizes fighters and he hypnotized his people and gets them to work on their game plan, their mindset. And it's very strange state. I did it once. Very strange. Very strange. Wow. Yeah. You're there like you're aware that it's happening.  It's not like, you know, like I've seen hypnotism shows. There was a guy in Rhode Island named Frank Santos. He was a comedy hypnotist and he would do these gigs in Boston. He was amazing. Yeah. We had a couple that came through Tempe every year. Some of them are good, right? Sure.  Some of those guys and it's certain there's a certain level of dummy that you use.  That dummy will be convinced he's a Game of Thrones riding the dragon. There's a certain level of dummy.  And it really look for me as a person who's met people like like John Carmac, who is the lead programmer of IT games who created Doom and call. Yeah, sure. Super super genius.  Like Elon, of course, meeting someone like him. Super, super genius. And then knowing how dumb some of my friends are. I'm like and I'm dumb too. But it's like I'm around him and are like, OK, this is I don't think I wonder what is life like to that guy. I guarantee you he's not looking at shit the way I'm looking at it. You know, he's looking at he's like looking into the Matrix. Yeah.  Yeah.  I think there's levels lower than us. And you get to this level where you can talk a guy into thinking he's having sex with Kristi Tiguan. You could he'll really believe that him and Kim Kardashian are having sex. You can you can convince those people and they even come in their pants. This guy, Frank Santos, used to make guys not in their pants. No, no, 100 percent. What are you talking about? Back then it was Madonna.  I'm not kidding, man. First of all, the guy was a wizard.  This is. No, he's dead, unfortunately.  So it is. His son is doing stand up and his son, his son is doing the hypnotism shows son of the same name.  But anyway, he was he would have this show weekly. It stitches, stitches was a big comedy club in Boston. And all the comics like Fitzsimmons and me, we would go to the back of the room and watch the Frank Santo's show all the time. I was dating a waitress there at the time and I would say I'd be there all the time. So even if I had never said we'd come down and watch Frank Santo's show because it was so ridiculous.  Those were always my favorite shows to watch to, except for obviously the greatest comics that would come through. But yeah, those were always a fun show.  They were ridiculously when Pete when he gets people to do things and tells them you're on a bus and the bus is about to go off the cliff into the ocean and you don't know how to swim here, I guess my favorite or the human midnight ones where that was the dirty one that would always do the dirty show. One time I saw it was a couple in this guy, he convinced this girl she was in a porno and she they gave her a banana and he she started deep throwing the banana and the whole crowd was going insane.  And then they got in like he like sadly he beat her up in the parking lot. But but yeah. Yeah, it wasn't a great ending, but yeah.  But those shows were he was wild, the guy, not the hypnotist, the her boyfriend boyfriend. Because he was in the audience. Oh yeah. Because he was with. No.  So it wasn't his fault but that was the. But that was the last time we did the the midnight hypnotist show.  But what you can, you can't get mad at a woman for expressing her intention. Of course now she's got to get to respect it. But this is really who she really is.  You sort of you're you do hypnosis now with this.  I was terrified. I was really nervous coming in here. I've been thinking about it ever since you invited me. I'm like, I'm going to puke all over the studio.  It makes me I lost so much sleep over it.  But you put people like your you like I seen it with Stern and now with you where I don't know what it is.  You're like you do hypnosis now you put everyone you know, Adam, we're actually friends. I know that we can do this. If we at dinner we would talk like this.  Yeah, but you have a large order like it's different, man, but you got to not think about that. All right. Yeah, that's the thing. If you think about that, that fucks. Right, right, right.  Don't think about that. OK, just think about the fact that this is how we would talk no matter what. This is true. Right? If we were hanging on the back bar, the Comedy Store, you and me just hanging out in the back there, just like those things got for Eric, creating that back, pleasing, you know, the bar is the best part of the comedy club.  It's amazing. And it has the bar that's actually from Mitzi Shaw's house. So I love that. Yeah, that's crazy.  Yeah, that bar's perfect. That's my one. Little like a place to go for solace.  Yeah. It's a it's a sweet spot when it doesn't get overrun. Sometimes I bring that up on a weekly basis.  We got to that'll be number one on the agenda.  Not even comedians. I know what's happening here. What is this.  I almost prefer them to the to the open my purse. Yeah. Yeah. Because then they're they're like asking bugging people to be on their podcast.  Exactly. It's the open mics are tricky because, you know, they asked me included, like I said about Ari, we all started as open markers are is basically I think just starting to do sets like page sets. Probably when he got here, I wonder when he first started getting paid, but I started taking him on the road with me.  Twenty four or five, something like that. It was a couple of years into his career and he was, you know, coming up from being a door guy to getting fairly regular spots. And he just kept getting better and working at it so that that day that he was doing his specials like, I have to be there.  I have to. I have to write. I'm like you, I have to fight like all of my horrible instincts to run away and fucking. Just had to thank God you fucking did, and thank God they they allowed allowed him to film that special handcar because they at first it took a lot of took a lot of convincing to get the first part.  And that was when I pulled into the parking lot that Tuesday night, the night before special. I was nervous, like nervous to be driving in the back parking lot.  You took seven years off and that was weird. It's like like going back to your old high school or something. I don't know. I can't imagine what that was like going back home from from a long, long time away.  What did contact high? You can't be in this room in 90 days. It's like it's like if you went. Yeah. If you had hadn't returned home for for many years.  Yeah. Yeah. Steigerwald family.  And I'm worried that we're going to lose clubs, you know, I'm worried we're going to lose restaurants. I'm worried we're going to lose clubs. I'm worried we're going to lose everything. Yeah.  It's, it's terrifying. I try not to think about it, but I think the Comedy Store is going to thank God. I think the Comedy Store will be OK.  I don't know, man, I just don't fucking know. Yeah, I don't know either. They don't let us back in soon because it's not even June. You know, they're talking about July 4th. Like what? What is going to happen over the next month? I don't know.  Yeah, we got to open. I can't I can't anymore. I'm nervous about. The way it's going to reboot, like what's going to happen, what's it going to be like? You mean in terms of the capacity in terms of what what's going on in society, society and society? Yeah, I don't know. Like it's the streets are so empty right now. They're ominous. And this is like an ominous feeling when you're driving around of like this is just the beginnings of a volcano.  But that's what it feels like. Look, eventually it seems like they're going to have a vaccine for sure. I know. Nothing definite. What do you doctor know about. Sounds like it sounds like the have some some progress and some. Yeah. Maybe. OK, I don't know.  I mean if it was ready they would give it to us, right. No. Yeah. It's not really ready and there's, there's talk about it.  There's also talk about something final with the fuckin m RNA viruses. We were talking about this before.  I mean, do I even want to know this is a new kind of a not virus excuse me, vaccine RNA, a vaccine. So this is some shit that Alex Jones told me about and he said it's something that we all have to be very concerned with. I just Googled it. What do you. Which one?  So it's something that it's a vaccine that's going to be able to like uses your own body to create proteins.  Right. Isn't that how it works? Something along those lines? No, I'm butchering this. But instead of, like, having a hair, does it say, OK, scientists produce a synthetic version of the RNA that a virus uses to build its infectious proteins?  Click on that. Yeah, see, I'm clearly butchering it, but that's the idea of it, is it? It makes your body produce something that protects you from the virus.  Maybe it turned the song to fuckin Spider Man. All right, I'm in.  I mean, yeah, I'm like one of these things, right? Not kill us, but turn into superheroes. When do we get to the doctor? I love you. Obviously, you want to be a doctor. I want to live on Mars and not give a fuck and travel through the universe and have no emotions and be blue and Jack.  I was going to say, like, of all the superheroes, that's the one that you would resemble the most currently.  Well, he's the only superhero. You're going to be a superhero as everyone else is basically like a person with some extra extra things that he's a god.  Dr. Manhattan is like he's like one level below a God who was fucking galactic. What was galactic? Galactic? I don't know, man. He was like a planet. I don't fucking know all those superhero movies, man.  People who don't enjoy the superhero movies lose my number.  Yeah. How could you be that sad? I don't know all of them, but most of them. Just a lot of good ones. Yeah, they're fun.  Here's Galactus, galactic Galactus Galactus originally Gilan before its transformation.  Oh yeah. Transformation and turn into something. A single survivor of the universe preceding the big bang of the main universe of the Marvel Comics universe.  What would these traits and his appointment of powerful beings as his Herold's formerly the Silver Surfer. Oh, he used to run the Silver Surfer.  That's right. OK, that's right.  I just saw him being a Bigfoot. Look, he's he's holding a fucking planet. He's going to be the next guy that they I win this prize. Start up the movies. Oh, no way. Really. I'm making a guess. It's OK. Sounds like they're bringing him back.  Big Brother should bring back the Silver Surfer man. I fucking love this. When I was a kid, he did it once, but it was kind of weird to stick for those were.  Those weren't. Yeah.  There was one Silver Surfer movie though wasn't there. I think it was was there was a Fantastic Four.  I think it was a family season for Silver Surfer. I think there was also an actual rise of the Silver Surfer.  Oh for twenty seven. Oh. So it was a specific episode of the Fantastic Four, The Rise of the Silver Surfer sequel to that first with Chris Evans when he was fantastic.  They got to keep everybody together.  The Silver Surfer have his own shit, count the surfer and have some fun.  Michael Chiklis was the thing. See but see there's four four people silver surfers five when the fucker give him his own show. Yeah.  Silver Surfer was so dope. He was dope as fuck. Yeah. Yeah.  Michael Chiklis that Captain America. Yeah. He was in this. And what was he. What was his name. Yeah. Oh shit.  Who the fuck is Mr. Fantastic.  Michael Chiklis was a good thing too. You ever watch that guy, that cop show that guy was right. No, no, no.  Don't afterwards shield the shield. She was. She was great. She was excellent. Yeah, that was true.  That was a really good cop show. Like really good.  I think it was complicated. And she's on an episode of he oh, he's jerking off on people cautious. All right. That sounds right. It sounds like what you get arrested for.  Yeah. Those those movies are fun, man. Like like now more than ever when chick it's really hard.  That's when people want escapism. Yeah.  That's when something like a comic book movies, the most fun I went through and I just started watching all the ones I missed because of the shield. Here it is. Oh no way.  Look at his beat up on the alleyway and they're going to arrest him for that. Yeah. Does he believe in someone's window peeping Tom? Oh, that's hilarious.  Is that a funny thing that they get you for? Oh, he gives up so easy to look so easy. That's hilarious.  You try to push that cop one cop. So disrespectful. Outstanding.  I love it silly. But in that he was looking at that guy fucking asshole. Oh oh oh. Maybe both of them.  Oh it's going to stick around. He's going to make him a dresser with his hands cuffed behind his back. And look, they don't even put their clothes on.  They're like, we're going to go back to fucking real quick. So what do you have to do here? Look at her. She doesn't even have clothes on the TV show. It's hilarious.  But do you imagine, like, you have to answer the door so quickly, you can even put your clothes on. You stole a T-shirt over your tits, supernormal. Everybody does that.  When there's a whole group of people outside, you say, hold on, I need to get dressed.  You go back, fucking get dressed. The ladies is an animal seer. She's got a talent.  She doesn't want to tie it on. She's like, I'm going to let this go because I'm going to fuck him.  Right. That's what she looked like. She got to go down to the station. You got pretty close. She's not going anywhere now. You shouldn't have time for that shit. She's not going to press charges now. You could see it in her eyes.  Get out of here, you creep. That's a weird one. No, right. Like peeping into people's windows is illegal, but they're glass. That's true, they are right in there. Yeah, yeah. Seems weird. Bert took it a little too far, maybe for sure he was beaten on.  Yeah, but like, if you have a window that's facing an alley and someone walks in that alley and they stare in your window, who's the asshole?  Yeah, that's a good point. I think there's a time limit. Maybe he should count ten Mississippi to get the fuck out of the weirdness. People out. Yeah.  Yeah, we're we're we're rear window. Is that movie the Hitchcock movie.  Yeah. A fucking great. Yeah. Gone.  Oh yeah. He partment. That's right. He spent the whole fucking movie staring into that guy's apartment with binoculars across the way.  I basically barely remember that was way before my time. Now you know what I barely remembered five I think I barely remembered.  I watched a little bit of it recently.  It's psycho. It's great. I mean the beginning especially. Yeah, I just I watched I just watched the shower scene.  The crazy. OK, he puts the wig on, stabs chicks spoiler alerts from nineteen forty.  But it's, it's Selznick's whatever it was that it was. I think so yeah. Whatever it was, it was, it was such a it was so different than any movie you'd ever see today. Yeah. It's like it was so just the pacing and the suspense. Love it, it's just different.  It's I used to watch all the old like it's like Twilight Zone or the old Hitchcock or Alfred Hitchcock presents around the same time.  Women back then when he he actually with Janet Leigh, he made sure that it was ice cold water so that the scream like he would turn it to to make sure that the water was ice cold. Right. When she was getting stabbed. So those screams are like actual fucking primal scream.  Oh, wow. That sounds very Hitchcockian, but do this was such a crazy thing, a naked lady, right, washing herself off, look at her in ecstasy. This was like erotica. Yeah.  And then. And then. And there's two different shot. Yeah. This is why it's so scary. Groundbreaking because you're in love with her. You're like, I wish I was there to wash your car.  Yeah. You know what I mean.  Like, if you're a guy and you're sad this.  Just in saying so. Oh, and then that shot. Yeah, you like here. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  This is such a crazy movie. The scene was so insane. Whoa. Oh, so insane, dude. Oh wow.  Yeah. It still holds up like a motherfucker. Yeah.  It holds up, it's, it's masterful in that you don't see anything gory, but you're still horrified and flinching while it's happening. Yeah.  Like Reservoir Dogs when when Mr. Blonde cuts off the cop's ear. Yeah.  But even more fucked up because you're in love with her and you were just going to wash your hair. It's 1968.  She wanted to wash your hair, you know, because I saying this holds up. This is like the size when I saw The Exorcist in the theater, when they rereleased it after like the twenty fifth anniversary, I me and my friends were hilariously laughing at some of the scenes because people had built it up so long our whole lives. Oh yes. The scariest thing ever.  And she's running down the stairs backwards and she steps on herself.  We just thought it was hilarious. It was just wasn't.  I mean, we still scream and those aren't scary either. But like that's like our generation's scary movies where it was just wild. How funny.  The stuff I remember the first one I ever saw as a kid was The Shining, and that's still tarof still holds up.  That's an interesting one. Right, because Stephen King didn't like it. Yeah, that makes sense because it is wildly different from it's a it's a huge departure from the norm. So I can imagine if you're an artist and then someone takes your artwork and they completely change it in many different ways.  They will you know, they changed it a bunch of ways, but they kept it a bunch of ways to it became like a collaboration between him and Kubrick because it was clearly his original idea.  But yeah, he wanted I believe Steven King wanted that character to go crazy.  He didn't want to have this fucking edge, like, right from the beginning, you know, like Jack Nicholson had an edge, like right from the beginning and then became insane and then, you know, became I know what it's like.  Yeah. To be an alcoholic who just stopped drinking. And I think you have that edge almost from the get go. Yeah, a little bit.  But I mean, Jack's Jack that movie was so good. It was top top ten all time favorite. That's what's crazy. It's like someone need to tell Stephen King, look, I know what same saying thank God damn it was good. It was so good. Dude, when those little girls are in the hallway and the fucking blood coming out of the elevator. Holy shit, that's a good movie. So many great moments.  And back then when it came out, like people don't understand, like the Shining is like, what is that, 82 or nineteen eighty I think because it thinks so.  Is that it is. Yeah.  So nineteen eighty people. You've got to understand what we're talking about. A whole different world. Yeah.  There's no, there's no special effects. If there are they're, they're not very good. They're all like yeah you had an Empire strikes back.  Yeah. Yeah it's clunky. Yeah. The special effects are clunky. I guess Empire Strikes Back is pretty fucking dull.  And then Alien was 79. That's right. All right. But that's pretty much fallen apart.  Blade Runner was 82. So there's really not much else though, but there is a lot of clunky.  So they did this movie with just just mean just all the. Yeah. All of the different crazy moments like that bathroom moment with the Yanks coming through the door.  It was so many of those moments, the moment the old lady, because Kubrick was a fucking master at creating suspense and using the sets and the color contrasts like just the color patterns are unsettling.  And the fact that he used those twins weren't exactly they weren't twins. They were just little differences. That makes it unsettling. There's so many different ways.  You know, he used to do complex mathematics for fun. That's how what a genius he was.  A trippy dude by far. I think the greatest director of all time.  Well, he definitely is one of them and one of the most unique ones. You know, there's a crazy conspiracy theory connected to the Shining in the moon landing.  Yeah, I heard the moonwalk. Yeah.  It's all about the number on the doors, exact same amount of thousands of miles, two, three, seven. And it's two hundred thirty seven thousand miles away. Also, by the way, it varies. See, that's the problem with that argument is that like the the the distance between the earth and the moon is not constant. I think it moves a little bit. So I think it goes as far as two hundred sixty five thousand feet out.  If I'm from or miles around rather two hundred sixty five thousand miles out and it goes to two hundred thirty seven.  But I think it varies.  It goes like this. I think it has like an elliptical orbit around the Earth a little bit. I maybe I made that up. Is that true? Yes, that sounds like I was in the middle of reading the two thirty seven stuff. Yeah, I heard it was also possibly about Native Americans, how the hotel was built on it on an ancient Indian burial ground. And even Shelley Duvall sort of look Native American here. Native American music playing in the opening credits.  I wouldn't be surprised. There's many layers to it. Yeah, he's just brilliant.  He was a brilliant, brilliant. The little kid did have an Apollo 11 sweater. Yeah, that's true. He did have an Apollo. I mean, that's pretty on the nose.  I just remember in the back room, in the stock room, there was like a can of a product with a giant. It was like Geronimo's head on the on the on there.  I'm sure they do this so much that probably many layers. The Kubrick is not going to operate on one layer. No. It's probably not such a weird shit in there. I mean, look at 2001.  What a mind. Oh my God. What a mindfuck. Yeah. Well, there was so much of his work, you know, and he's the guy that the the conspiracy theorists, when they get the most crazy, when they when they really want to dive into who did it, they think it was all Kubrick that Kubrick literally filmed the fake moon landing.  Right.  Uploaded it to the American TV satellites.  If anyone could do it, it'd be him. He would be the guy man to do it.  You imagine if that was that was really what happened after all these years.  I remember hearing all those fucking conspiracy theories about the Illuminati killing him because he made it. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, they were worried he was going to open his fucking mouth. Tell me about the moon landing. Oh, no, that's what the was told to fuck this fucking mouth shut that too.  That was his last one.  Like enough this guy's getting too close because I think he died like a like a week after that movie cause he did. That's fucked up.  That's how they roll people. This is the real people's thing.  Nobody really road that way until this Jeffrey Epstein shit. And they're like, oh, why?  It's shocking. This is the first really, truly eye opening one.  Like, yes, well, that's an Alex Jones one, too. Alex Jones was talking about that way before anybody was what he called it way before. And he said, there's this service and they take these elites and they bring them to this place and they have sex with underage girls. And everybody was like, no fucking way. That sounds like science fiction.  And then you realize like, oh, this is a hundred percent true.  And nobody was talking about it. 100 percent true.  That's crazy. It's insane. It's insane. It's so weird. Then the guy gets suicided.  The guy is in jail going to trial, and they're like, well, Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide today. Like, we're also we're in the 1940s again. Doo doo doo doo doo doo.  Breaking news that's just in. Jeffrey Epstein committed suicide today. One hundred percent convinced it was not fishy business.  I remember Diaz told me in the parking lot like a week before it happened. He's like, this guy's not going to try these kill.  They're killing this fucking authorities do not suspect foul play.  Jeffrey Epstein, filthy rich.  What does that new documentary comes out? The twenty seven is based off of James Patterson's booklets.  Came out a couple of years ago. Dude, I've been in a lot of years. I've been into these Jack Carr books. These have you have you ever read any Jack car?  No, Jack Car has three books and he's worked on a fourth one now. And it's all about it's like they're thrillers, but like there's espionage and political shit going on in there. And the main protagonist, I don't know. I know read Clancy, but the main guy is a Navy SEAL and there's all this crazy shit that happens. And in all these stories, but in a lot of them you go, wow, like this.  I used to think that something like this is preposterous, that people are just making up this idea that, you know, that people would conspire to do evil, creepy shit all over the world and do it to make money and sacrifice people's lives.  But as I've gotten older, I'm like, oh, that's probably way closer to what's really going on.  Probably. Well, that's probably way closer. Yep.  That's it's probably is like that. And then when a guy like Epstein gets arrested and then gets suicided and then everybody's like, well, too bad.  Yes, he's dead. I still fucking there's no Senate hearings. You're not standing in front of the TV every day going, what happened? How could one of the most important witnesses ever how could the cameras not be working?  He didn't continue doing that. He's so good at that. Oh, Tim, Doug is my favorite.  He's he's at all the young wild guy's coming up. He's the most wild. He's the most wild and consistently.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. He's fucking funny ish. Yeah. Sure. It's very wild to do very well trust me. He goes for it.  He goes for it. She lived in L.A. some risky turns. He takes some risky territory. Does Tim Dillon does too. That fucking Meghan McCain thing. Is the single still the greatest thing.  I've never seen however you want to fuck these kids. Apparently she blocked him, which made it even better.  I love the way he says what's her name? Oh, now he's dressed as a coronavirus. This is good to see you here. He did a rant about cruise ships on this past.  Great. I'm telling them rent today or yesterday, a fucking solid one.  Every time there's something going on with cruise ships, I said to him, now we just we have like this back and forth on just cruise ship shit.  I still say the most dangerous comic right now who will say whatever the fuck he wants is still Holtzmann.  Oh, yeah, that guy, he's bugged while he's always been Buckwild. I always quote Holtzmann. Thing about there's a lady who drowned her kids back in the day, Susan Smith.  And he goes, ladies and gentlemen, I heard those are bad kids. I mean, he's doing this like a week after these this fucking lady drowned her babies. Like they sat that close to the TV she didn't put away that blocks those kids will not be missed. They spilt milk. We're like, oh, no, after 9/11, Mizzi wouldn't put him up.  Oh, I mean, it's like you can't go up yet. Let me up.  It's you know, he was so funny of his memorial.  He would just say the most fucking horrible shit and then list off a bunch of random tour dates. He's like August 3rd, August 4th. I'll be at the junkyard in Montreal. Have you seen his Instagram? Thank God.  Yeah, that's what I say every day. I'm here at the in and out burger. Thank God it's Wednesday. He does some sketch with some lady at a Thai food place near his house.  So funny that chimes along in Vietnamese. And he's he's like interpreter.  He's he's a he's a wild man. He's a staple.  He really got it, you know, wouldn't exist any other place. Like there's something about the crazy darkness of the store that helps a guy like that.  We're putting him a lot in the documentary. So hopefully we get some good we got a lot of eyes on him I'm really excited about.  I always said the way to do a special with him was just to film him for like a month. Oh, yeah. Let him do all of his sets a month. Yeah. Piece it together. And we filmed a lot of we let him go for an hour and we got a lot of good material. We Haltzman this is the thing Larry.  Like it's the end of the night. Did your show and then you're leaving the back bar and you got to go take a leak and you go take a leak and then you hear what the fuck did I just say to you?  And you're like, oh my God, Boltzmann's. And you walk in there, there's like eight other people. You sit down.  Holtzmann Embarrassed at the end of the night.  It's a staple microphone always in the stand. Oh, so funny. It's oh my God.  And he's always he's sorry. Dangerfield Very late.  Rodney Well his look to is very old timey, like it's from another era tucked in shirt and he behaves like that too. Like these fucking kids today. Yeah.  I love it. Yeah. There's nothing better than the late night at the store with Thornberrys Holtzmann.  Used to be Browdy. You know what I would say about that place that there's I think there's a real argument for objects collecting energy put on you.  Woo! Hold on, Crystal. We're going to talk.  Sister, I think there's some real power in objects. And I think when you're around objects and you you have fun, like if you are, you're in that room, that comedy store, that's that room is like a it's like an encasing. It's like a vessel. Yeah.  And encasing of these moments and like and there's something in the walls like there's so many laughs have been had in that room. There's something in the wall. Yeah. I remember part of the psychological you're thinking about it here. I am. I'm thinking about, you know, this is but it's part of it's the seasoning. It's like a frying pan. You've used a bunch of times. It's like there's seasoning in that place I've never seen.  That's a perfect way to describe the seasoning. I never seen any ghost. Some very skeptical of that kind of thing was skeptical. But I'm telling you, I would close up that club by myself every night at three or four in the morning and for five years and. I didn't feel great about closing up by myself, and I like going up to the belly room and shutting off all the fucking lights. Yes, fuck that shit. That's the outlook.  It's like the Overlook Hotel. It's like the shining.  The belly room for me is the one that freaks me out.  And also it's because it's connected to all these corridors like this room there and the mirrors and stairs there. Yeah. And then over there is the little green room.  It's like everything else it's going to jump out. Right. And then there's a stairway to get downstairs in the hallway, go that far.  And then there's the doorway to the outside that would slam. Yeah. So many different entrances and exits and be like, I don't know how many people have been killed in that building.  I don't know how many people were killed in that building. Many, but I think they killed a fuck, all of them in that room upstairs.  Yeah, I'll bet that room upstairs. They did all the murder that gets me. I'm like, huh? I would think I think they did the murder probably in the basement.  No, that makes sense. Yeah, that would make sense. I heard that. I heard that as well about the basement. Yeah.  But that that room gives me the creeps. The basement gives me the creeps a little bit to it used to before they fucking converted it into a podcast studio that now gives you more the creeps.  Now I guess I did arguers show down there super creeps that was telling you about our guests.  And thank God that guy he always kills, right? He's constantly writing new material. It's always it's always solitude.  I fucking good. He's very good. And I also like his style with a dark room spotlight, like, yeah, we did sports together, which I'm usually not in the same time as him, like right right before him or after him. But we did them back to back once.  And I was like, damn, it's really good material, it's tight.  And it was all a lot of it is like things that are happening right now, like, like things that are current in the news, had great bits on them. He's great. Like a really, really sharp writer.  He's perfect to go up right there. Second. Second on the line. Yeah. He gets everything pop in a tone for them. I just love the fact that he loves it so much.  Yeah. He fucking he can't get enough of it. He's been doing it forever but he's five years but he still loves it.  Yeah. You ever see him jogging. Yes, I have super addicted to drugs. He can't get enough of that either. Yes. Seventy miles a day. Twice a day I heard.  Yes that's that's insane. I saw him one time outside and in the grocery store.  It's like seeing your teacher out of school. It was it was off.  And he jogs in Hollywood, which is even weirder, you know. I mean, like he's like, fuck a gym. I'm just going to use the road.  There's something about those people, right? When you're in your neighborhood and someone just use your neighborhood like a gym. Yeah, it's like something weird about that.  Shouldn't you go run where people run? Like, why are you running when people drive place?  But it's the thing that people do that driving, you know, like in New York City, there's always people that are using the city as their gym. Yeah. To just running like everybody else is walking and these people are exercising.  You know, it's fucking weird. Argus has targets even as a bit about that, does it? Yeah. He says you see a guy on a bicycle, Anello, that guy's working out. You see a guy on a bicycle. And in in Dallas, Texas, he's got DUI. It's true.  It's a pretty good argument. Impression, too.  It's OK, Sombat. This is a little bit of a slang term.  He from Oklahoma. Oh, they. Yeah, I've heard some great Arga stories over the years, like, you know, just him and all the history with Mizzi and the Shores.  Yeah, well, Vargus, we all love Vargus.  It's a great place, man. It's a great guy. It's a great place. There's so many so many good people there. Yeah. Just when when I say July, I think July when we do this fuck says no.  What if he says January 1st? Yeah, I think we are.  And I think we we all moved to Austin.  We all Trump fans of the president involved just ass. We all fucking Matute up, we all shoot up with some fucking Lysol and and walk down to Austin.  We don't require much. Mr. Trump, just open the fucking Comedy Store, please, please Stuka to open a comedy club.  So you've got our support. Why is this such a business?  It seems like it's it should be. It's certainly more essential in some of the other fucking businesses.  Think about how much different is the contact or close proximity to contact that you get if you were in a comedy show versus if you were in line at a store and you're handing a cashier your money and they're giving you money back and you're looking at it, you're touching hands. Yeah, exactly. We're inches away from each other. Yeah. Your face. Yeah. The guy with those bagging your shit, he gets he's bagging it inches from you. He's putting it in the thing hands.  Do you think you pass by someone here, you pass by someone there as you're leaving.  You're doing that shit all the time. Seems pretty simple to me.  You get you take the forehead temperature, make sure everybody enforce the masks separate by, you know, take out half the fucking tables.  And Clausewitz's crazy people don't even want you talking about this. Adam, I know this is what's weird about it. They get mad if you talk about it. If you can come up with solutions, if you even have a perspective other than what's what's going on right now.  Exactly. That's not good. No, it's not great. That's not good. We need no one needs no one knows what the fuck is the right thing to do here, right?  Yeah. Look, as much as I love Korean baseball, I want to go to work. I want to go back to work. Exactly. Fuck this sick man. That's what I'm saying.  Come on, Garcetti.  Here, you're a man.  Just keep if people want to be quarantined, let him be quarantined. But don't make everybody be quarantined. Yeah, no, man.  Boy, everything everybody's worked for in terms of their businesses, that's hard. And every day you guys are breaking it is ratings.  And every day that it goes on, it gets more and more severe.  I'm all for safety and health and all that shit. But but I think just like everything else in the world, we need balance. We need to really think about this and come up with some solutions and not just say, no, I don't like the narrative, particularly in this case, because it's not what we thought it was going to be.  In terms of the fatality rate. I don't like the narrative that they that you're protecting people, that you have to listen to them because it's protecting other people. I don't like that narrative. I don't think there's only one way to protect people the way another way to protect people would be isolate those people. And don't pretend that you can't do that, because if you can shut down the whole world, you can isolate the vulnerable. Right. You can't.  You did a monumental thing already. The most monumental thing really ever told people to stop working. And they did most of the world stop working for a couple of months. It's pretty crazy, pretty wild. But then you're saying you can do that, but you can't figure out how to isolate people that are vulnerable. Yeah. And give people the opportunity to make their own decisions. You let them fucking go dirt bike riding, right. You let them do back flips with motorcycles.  People do a lot of wild shit. Nobody has a problem with that.  Yeah, but if you tell them that they can't go out and possibly get themselves infected because they'll infect somebody else, like educate people, educate people, and if they do do it any way, that fucking piece of shit, they were probably going to put people in danger in some other way. They're probably drunk.  Drive with their mom, you know, was probably an asshole like you got to be you got to be cognizant of the vulnerable people for sure.  But you also have to give people the opportunity to earn a living.  You got to be homeless and fucking if they're willing to risk being sick, you've got to give them the opportunity to do that and you got to give them the education to help them get over that cold, helped them keep that virus from getting to them with all the precautions that everybody is using every day.  Sure. To to make sure that they're as safe as possible. Exactly. Yeah, that's it. But people don't even like that. You're talking about it.  Oh my God. There's so saying they're angry, so angry at me personally and civically.  Yeah. You right now. Because Jerry talked about it. He talked about it with me. You definitely got a second hand high.  So I probably said, yeah, he did. How do you know. I could tell. Oh, that's you got to just a touch.  Just a touch. It's the perfect amount. Yeah. Like if you're an alcoholic and you hang out with people who drink, it doesn't do a goddamn thing for no nothing. But if you're a smoker and you decide to take a little time off in your own people that smoke weed, you catch you catch a breeze.  I remember I did a show with Tripoli in Toronto. They have this on the ground. So Tripoli, that's all I got.  Lizard people, we did the show at that that underground place in Toronto. OK, that's all we do know about that place is the most preposterous show you've ever done in your life and trip, which is like boxing, a fucking hot boxing. Oh, fuck everybody. They had bangs on the table.  Insane. I was I mean, I was just looking out at a crowd. There was a cloud in front of you you could barely see with the spotlight and then all the smoke in the room, you barely saw what was going on and you were so high, there was no air. It was all weed. There was no air left. Like the candles were running on weed smoke. There was no air in the room. Fuck that. It was all just weed smoke.  Well, so Tripoli didn't even smoke anything but ten minutes.  And it was how you got where he was. Of course he was.  He was on another planet. Yeah. That's a problem in Texas. They don't let you have the weed. Oh. Oh really.  In Austin I think statewide thing.  What do you, what is the, is the evidence they that they, they have some CBD laws I think.  Yeah. You have CBD. I just I was Googling earlier. They have some talk of potentially passing laws for recovery from like lost money in legalizing it.  What I found out of doing my Texas studies because I have been doing research is it's a like Austin in particular is a very interesting combination of liberal folks and conservative folks like conservative, like Red Texas and then Blue Austin, and then a lot of like.  Stuff that's going on and then the governor doesn't want them to do certain things, so the governor doesn't want them shutting down construction sites. But like the city of Austin, I like the blue. It's like a lot of sheep.  Boston police will stop arrest tickets in most. Most I like that word most low level marijuana cases after a unanimous city council vote. What does that mean?  Maybe we'll let you go most.  We'll let it go. Most low level cases. Most of them. Most of them.  What kind of a law is that? What I mean, how do you have that even open to interpretation?  Most, yeah. Do you let people go if they only have a joint most of the time. Sometimes a fuck up.  What does that mean. Most just let me go say it's just weed you fucks Jesus.  I love all. But the problem is like you don't get a place is like fiercely independent is Texas is like fuck Wild West Texas without all that other stuff.  To Austin, it's like the artist colony Texas. But the people that are like right wing Texas think Austin's going to fuck it up for everybody.  The mayor's fucking up.  Yeah, it's interesting. It's interesting to see, like, that's the little battle that's going on because people want to keep it the way it is. They don't want it. They know it's special and they're worried that the liberals are going to fuck it up and the liberals are worried that Trump is going to fuck it up. Right.  And this is Austin's thing. Isn't their motto keep Austin weird?  No, that's only losers. You sell t shirts at the airport.  Well, that's all I really hang out with when I go to this airport does keep something weird or the they're the grossest of all teachers.  Couldn't hear the baby on board of t shirts, you know, fuck out of here with that.  So ridiculous.  Keep Austin weird, shut up, you're not weird, has a team at the bottom of it's the last thing you're giving Austin a bad name.  You know Austin's great, the T-shirts. No, I'm saying the keep Austin weird people.  Are you accusing me? I don't know that at all.  So we didn't even talk about your culture. All right. Yeah. Yeah, we forgot. We have time. Fuck. Yeah. All right. Plenty time right here. I don't even know where to fucking begin, so.  When when did you first become part of the cult? So I got sent away to this coal, it was like a cold boarding school. How old were you? I was 14. I just turned 14.  And did your parents know what was going on or did they think. No, they had no idea. What did they think it was? They heard it was for a place for troubled kids to get some help.  And then, yeah, they had no idea it was a cult.  Wow. No. Well, what was it? It was. Does it have a name? Yeah, it's called CEDO. It's a CDU. And they called it that because you could see yourself how you want to be and then you do something about it.  And that sounds like something like Tony Robbins would say.  Yeah, it used to be I think it was created from originally from something called Synanon, which I think is more well known, but it's.  Yeah, that sounds like some cheesy not not Tony Robbins, but like a low level, like online or motivational guy.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Exactly. What you do is see and then do. Yeah. Sounds sort of subtle and it is for you you're going to see. Yeah. Well you don't like, you're going to do something about it but it's like oh my God, thanks for being here at the Hilton in Alhambra.  So this is pre Internet. You're 14 years old. Yeah. Nineteen ninety three. I was couteur, I was living in Tarzana.  I grew up there.  Yeah. Big Qatar. What was that about. Oh no. We're friends doing it.  No, no I was doing it, I don't I my, my dad left and then I started cutting, I kind of got in then I was getting into fights at school and I was punching holes in my wall.  I was an angry kid so it was sort of an outlet, I guess.  And then they kept sending me up to the Ridge psych ward. So I got sent away up to Northridge in the youth psych ward. And then what did they say about you?  They I don't remember specifically what they said. I think they just told my parents they they didn't tell me anything.  I think they told my parents probably any parents didn't, like, have a sit down with you and say, hey, psycho, after the third year, the doctor said, my mom didn't know what to do with me.  But after the third time, they said after the third time I got sent up to the psych ward, they said, if you do this one more time, you know anything else, we're going to have to send you away somewhere, you know, more serious, probably. Whoa.  And so I did it again. And then we took a tour up to they said they were we were just going to go up to take a tour of the school that I could be sent away to. That was it. They said, if you do it one more time, we're going up and we're going to tour this school. And if you do this one more time, then we're going to bring you back here and drop you off. You're going to stay there.  Wow.  And so we went up to the San Bernardino Mountains and we got we got out of the car. I toured the campus, a beautiful campus. It was like this giant cabin up near Lake Arrowhead. And it used to be owned by the Houstons, you know, Walter and Angelica and John Houston. And and they were telling me, you know, just about the school and stuff and all the rules. There were a lot of rules.  They called them agreements. And then my parents, I came back and went and talked to my parents and they told me that I was staying there and I just said, well, fuck you.  And then I left and and they strip searched me and then and that was it. And then I went into what they call a rap. And raps are intense.  So what the rap was this three hour long, kind of like a group therapy session, but everyone is just sort of, oh, my God, it was so bizarre.  So I had only been at the school to two hours. I'd just been strip searched. And I've been put into one of these three hour wraps. And the the girl next to me was like rocking back and forth on the chair, sort of like sobbing quietly. And then the kid next to me got up, walked across the room and switch seats with someone. Because you weren't allowed to talk to someone next to you, you had to be across the room.  And that kid started screaming at the kid right next to me over here. And then this one just started screaming at the floor and like started like screaming at the floor, like, I hate you, mom.  I hate you, Dad. And then someone started putting all the like this Kleenex, all these tissues. And I'm like, why are they putting all these fucking tissues here?  And then you just see all the snot and spit and, like, mucus empty out of this this girl's body because she's just screaming and like, blood vessels are popping in her fucking and she's crying and screaming. And it was the most disgusting thing you've ever seen. Fuck. And I was like, oh, my God, I'm going to be here for two and a half years.  And this is how this is going to happen. Three times a week. There was a lot of sleep deprivation.  They had what do you. I think it was they thought they were told by the counselors at the psych ward that it was like a place for troubled kids when you didn't know what else to do with them.  So the word was in on it.  Yeah, yeah. It's weird. And so I think I think they were fooled. Or do you think that they knew what was going on, that maybe they were fooled? I think they were probably fooled.  I don't think I don't think this is pre Internet. Right. This is easier to fool people because you can't do a wiki on them.  Yeah, I mean, the Google the government finally shut them down. So they were accredited, though, or something. I I think proved by.  Yeah, it had been you know, around was there for I think since the 70s want so maybe even earlier, maybe in the late 60s.  That's the scary ones. Yeah. Ones with legs. Yeah.  Yeah. Yeah. You know, but it was a really weird mix of, of students. It was like I think Paris Hilton went there at one point and then there was like just a lot of kids there on court orders.  And there was you know, it was just a real mix, weird mix of people. Wow. But they had these 24 hour what they called prophets, and they were all named after a different chapter of the book called The Prophet by Khalil Gibran.  Dude, I have to pee so bad. Well, I'm going to stop you right here because I can't. I was like, I'm going to hang on to this. I'll be fine. I drank three cups of coffee before I got here.  Oh, please. I'm sorry. We'll be right back, folks.  Sorry we're back. You were saying something about the prophet based on the Khelil Gabriel. How do you say that? Khalil Gibran?  Gerbrand Yeah, they they have these things called prophets. So you you come you go through the program with a peer group. So everybody that was enrolled at the same time as you in the same way, two months, you go through these almost like these rites of passage just called prophets.  And there were these twenty four hour long workshops and they're all based around each chapter of this book called The Prophet. And the first one was called The Truth.  And it was like the truth will set you free. So you basically tell everything you've ever done that you felt bad about.  And it's like confession almost. Hmm.  And what was odd is that all the staff members were there were a lot of us there were like two or three staff members who are the counselors at the school.  They had no real credentials. They weren't like therapists, but they acted as therapists.  But they all had fucked up lives, too. And so. And some of them. Yeah. And so some of them, like there were people that really got off on the power, like any cult leaders do. And then there were some that were former students there that were sent away for being bad kids. So there were staff members like confessing to I heard one guy said claimed that he set a homeless guy on fire. Another one would strangle cats.  And they're like, these are the fucking people that are teaching us sleep around a dude who used to strangle.  No, you couldn't fall asleep in the in the profits.  Oh, I mean, eventually, you know, because they lived off campus. Oh, fuck.  Man, that sounds insane. Yeah, it was pretty wild. They all have that element in them. That's a Scientology element too. Right. And then also Catholicism, you have to confess, right. That there's a thing that Scientology does where they they go over all sorts of aspects of your life and they they like save that.  Yeah, I save all those recordings.  And then when you want to talk shit, they're like, oh well you think about leaving are fascinating. Yeah. We're going to want to tell everybody about that thing that you do with clowns.  I wonder why they would do it here then. Because we had no power to like we were all underage. We they you know.  Well, that's different. Different organization. Yeah. You know, what they're doing is probably getting power over you.  I mean, it seems like that's what those things are always about. They're always about power.  And that's usually the main dudes banging everybody's wife and they get a lot of money. The teachers there were teachers that were for sure bring in the students. There's no doubt about it.  It is if some look, if a guy can lie about what he does for a living right. And get laid, they'll do it. Oh, yeah. It's there's a certain percentage of guys that will do it. If they can lie and control people, they'll do that, too.  Like it's just different levels of douchebag. Right.  Do you get to that leader? The boss is just like everything compar. Yeah, right.  OK, it's like level, there's levels of where people can you know, they could control people in the strangest ways and get people like the Hale Bopp Comet people. Oh yeah, exactly. They cut their balls off. That was a big part of it. Like policing yourself.  Remember that part of the fucking story. Yeah. Holy shit. Yeah. The main guy got his balls off and you encourage others to cut their balls off as well to free themselves from the confines of sexual lust.  OK. Yeah, yeah, you have to remember that. I remember I remember exactly what it looked like. He almost looked like Mr. Magoo without glasses like that. Yeah. Oh my gosh.  So you don't have to have a good hustle to start a cult. Like, that's not a good hustle. That's a terrible hustle.  But you need to have a hustle that works good on dumb people. Right.  And that's the difference. Just like the guy when Frank Santos used to do is hypnotism, Max stitches. There was a guy that would come in his pants every you know, he wouldn't he would do different things, different times. He'd make things out. He had a bunch of different things he would do. But I remember one of them. He's like, this is a Madonna was hot. Oh, sure. He was telling this guy that he's having sex with Madonna.  It might have been Janet Jackson, someone like that, someone very popular at the time, some hot and popular.  And then he he's like, you're going to oh, my goodness, you're going to pop. And the kids like, oh, the kid comes and you're like, I don't believe this. We're all looking at each other.  And Greg was like, for sure he came. I'm like, for sure. The guy just came. The guy came in like, looks on the bears is like looking around confused. He's not a good actor. He's just a moron. There's certain things that some guys can do to really dumb people where they can sink into their brain.  But stand up is similar to that. But not not not really. It's similar to hypnosis. That kind of hypnosis is weird. Hypnosis. It only works on really moronic people, very susceptible to this vulnerable people.  Man, maybe it might not even be dumb. It might be just you got programmed poorly. Look, I know a lady who's Mormon her whole life Mormon. And one of the things she said that was kind of shocking. She was like, I'm more because she she left that religion. And she's like, but I'm very susceptible to to bullshit and I'm very susceptible to like gurus and cults. It's like there's a part when you develop your whole life.  Thirty five forty five years of thinking a certain way. And then also it's shut off and like, OK, that all that stuff that you believe, that was all bullshit. So don't go there anymore. Now good luck and good luck.  Who's got the answer. Who's got the. Those are the ones and ripe for the picking so it might not even be dumb.  It's more lost their need.  They need some direction. They need something for something. Program quarterly. Yeah.  Well I wasn't I don't think there is. There's Frank Xenos. Oh this is funny. This is the comedy connection. This is when they moved to stiches.  This is the larger room that was in Faneuil Hall. He did a little bit. A little bit. Do you get any volume on this? He's making them I think they just watch a sad movie in this clip. Yeah, see, they're all crying. Oh, no, know it comes out of the top. His people were all freaking out. These were all freaking out. Did you have to see in real life this is not doing a justice like the guy who was there was certain people that were faking it, let me tell, when you're faking it, you would walk up to you and you come, you know, get out and you kick those guys out.  Love that.  There was other guys that just hook, line and sinker. Yeah. They believe they were on it. Yeah. They believe they're having sex with a mermaid or something. They believe they were in a sword fight.  It's just that's so fascinating to me. Yeah, it is. And that's who gets caught to the helicopter and gets the kind of dick balls.  Yeah. I don't think. Well fair enough. Either way, it's pretty intense.  It's an intense commitment to your faith. God, I went along with it because I didn't want to extend my sentence. If you got in trouble and you didn't play along and you didn't follow the rules and you had six months to your sentence, you drop a peer group because you didn't know going in that it was a cult.  When they think you figured it out until I was like until like a fucking two years after I had graduated.  So two years after it's all over, you sit around going, hey, I think I just started talking like, didn't you think that was a little weird when they did this or this or that or and I was like, oh, you mention it.  Wait a minute.  Yeah, we had to do 14 days through Joshua Tree, which was beautiful, which was great.  But then four days solo when they give you like a bag of trail mix and some water and a whistle and they said, I will come back in four days.  But as a 14 year old, it's like, what the fuck? What the fuck? Yeah, it was intense.  Crazy. Where was this? Where the woods in Joshua Tree.  That's fucking sketchy area. Yeah. Fourteen years in the desert. That's crazy. Yeah.  Where are we supposed to get your water. You got a big bag of water. That was a bag of water for four days. For four days. How big is this bag. I don't know. Can you have your own bag.  Yeah. Yeah. You were alone. They give you an area about half the size of this room, the studio, and they say, all right, we'll come get you in four days.  Here's four granola bars, a bag of trail mix and a bag of water and a whistle in case you got bit by a rattlesnake.  Oh, my God. And then so where are they with the seven? They know where they said they were. They were around and they monit they. I think they monitor. Yeah.  So they probably saw a lot of beaten off. Hmm. Fourteen years old.  I think I spent most of my days if I was a fourteen year old and I came up with a call, that would be one of the rules. Was a rule. No beating. No, no, no.  I'd be like you're going to all be by yourself for days for granola bars and a bag of water like it sounds like something a fourteen year old would come up with as far as sounds like an episode of Fucking Fear Factor. And here's a whistle.  If you get bit by a rattler, I'll be at the top of the hill. You won't see me. I'll be able to hear you like that.  Sounds like a 14 year old it I'll never forget to. When we came out, they told us Kurt Cobain had just killed himself. It was those ninety four.  But I remember if you get in trouble, they put you on something called a full time.  And that was never fun because it was like you had it was the amount of time of the full time was in the turn.  So it was based on the staff member. It was either you ran away or you had sex with another or I happened.  Yeah, it's a gang and not me in between.  Snotty screams Yeah. A lot of primal scream therapy, but it was so but but on a full time, like, you wake up and you have to like try and dig out a stump that's been there since the 70s.  Nothing was ever going to fucking take it out. The biggest stuff you've ever fucking seen. I remember when I got enrolled, the first thing I saw was a kid and a pickaxe. And I'm like, what the fuck?  That's why they have dynamite. Yeah.  And the dynamite, well, they used it for full timers, but you're not allowed to laugh or sing or no human contact. You can't talk to anybody for three weeks.  Oh my God. They're my subconscious. Yeah.  They mind fuck fucked you. There was something called smushing where everybody it was like you walk into this giant house that every night and everyone is telling each other their life stories.  But it look like you remember Jonestown when like the nine hundred nine people had just drank the Kool-Aid and it was just body on top of body. That's what it looked like. Everyone's just cuddling with each other. Oh my God. That's like all the staff members are fucking rubbing here.  Jesus Christ. You know, like this seems highly inappropriate with, like, girls. Thirteen year old girls head in their lap.  Oh, yeah. It's fucking it was trippy, but yeah. I've got my buddy, our buddy Jeff Garland, put me in touch with this fantastic writer who writes a lot of episodes of Better Call Saul. And we're almost done with our pilot. We're going to pitch it in about a month.  I feel like that's. One that's going to be fascinating to see how they play that narrative, whether they will show that kind of shit like a 13 year old girl in a guy's lap like that seems like that. You can't even do that.  We'll say you can't even do that in fiction, you know, I mean, you'd have to imply it.  That's a good point.  Well, you know, be closed.  The problem is it really happened, right? So it's not like it's fiction. So if you were creating this kind of fiction, you're putting it out. People be like, what, you sick fuck? Why did you even think of that? But you're not doing that.  That's true. Yeah. You're releasing some crazy shit that you actually experienced. And how many years you there for? Almost three.  Wow. Yeah. Some of the exercises were crazy. They did this one called Lifeboat where they choose to students. I was one of the students at shows and you're on a chair and you can only save two people in all your best friends and shit are sobbing and they're like, oh, please put me.  And you have to look each person in the eye and tell them why they they die, what the fuck? And then they and then everyone had to write their own eulogy. Fucking weird.  A girl slit her own throat. Oh, Jesus. And another kid jumped off a cliff.  See, this is where I'm with the FBI, where I take this mike. I get it. I know why you have to investigate these people. I understand why you're so wary of people starting cults. Because I was saying this to my friend, how come no one has ever started a good cult, you know, like Brigitte Fettucini?  We're talking about this. The other day I said we should just call it the cult like, you know, in homage to the band.  What about death squad? But it's not a cult. I'm just kidding. I'm saying a real cult like no one can start a good one.  Like good like a real solid one with like, good morals, like they're all the same. But this is why the service. But I think you're on to something once. This is why the FBI is forced to jump in, because it's almost like a thing that's 99 percent done by assholes, one percent. I'm looking for the needle in a haystack. I'm looking for that piece of gold in the pile of shit. I know it's in there.  One of those cults, someone who really just has good intentions.  Do you know Alex Graves? Oh, yeah.  I love fucking Alex. Right. Psychedelics, he might be one is he is actually slightly right. He's the real deal because he actually started a religion. And the religion is based on art. It's not based on profit. And he's building the most insane, beautiful artistic structure like this.  I love this shit. The thing that they're building to do their worship.  And I mean what you call a cathedral, as you call it, cathedral. What does he call it? Chapel Chapel of Sacred Marriage is not what he calls it. I heard about this fact.  No, that's I think that's what he called the police in New York. I think he calls this something different. But you've seen it, right? Have you seen the images I've seen I have I have a couple of I have one art book from me. I think it's in there maybe. No, I don't think so.  It's new, but it's some of the images from that from his art in the in the cathedral.  The whole thing is like this gigantic work of art is I don't know if they're 3-D printing the outside or Kazam is causing mirrors.  Antione is that. That's right. That's right. Making and is the place up in upstate New York. I think Duncan said he was there. He belongs there. He's going to move there. That makes sense. Yeah. I totally don't think it's a good falkenstein. That's what it looks like now. It's a stunning dude.  It's dope. It's basically his art, but his art in a building like he made a building out of his art school where Chris seems like it would be in like Sedona.  There's no man in upstate New York. Yeah. And they're like good taxpayers and shit they like. And it's a real religion. So I think they have actually they're not good taxpayers. They have tax exempt status. I think that's the whole deal. Oh, shit.  Yeah. Good for them. That's what I'm saying. I think they're a real religion. Yeah. There it is. But he's a guy that I believe he seems like a good dude. Oh.  He's trying to now take everybody's money and bang his wife. Yeah. He's really just this guy. He's a really sweetheart guy and an amazing there are people like that, you know.  Do Ramadoss. Yeah, yeah. Ramdas is a great example. Yeah. This is people that really do exist or did exist that really are pure. That's really what they want to do. Yeah, that's true.  But I don't like this guy started out that way. Who knows the guy out of 100. Yeah. One out of one hundred one in 100. Most of them get to that spot.  They just you know, it's like when when they get into it in the first place, are they doing it because they've it's been done to them like some of them clearly. Right.  Some of them seemed like they were on there is for sure. That's why I know the one who, like, set the homeless guy on fire. I know that for sure. That's why he did it. He got put through this bullshit. He was going to inflict it on somebody else. Oh, yeah.  Garbage, garbage people. And then the craziest thing was maybe about seven or eight years after I graduated, a lot of kids would split. I split. You run away, but then you get caught. Are you what are you come back to the school once you find out your parents are going to take you out. But a lot of kids never came back and we just.  That's it. That was just the fact to the kids. We don't know what the fuck happened to them. They would always tell us that the parents pulled them out of the school, some of the kids that ran away and never came back. But it was on the side of this giant, like almost like a cliff, this backside of a mountain.  And some kids would walk down into town through the road. And some kids, they said, would run away and go down the back side of the mountain. And they said some kids died going down the back side. Some kids got kidnapped. Who fucking knows?  But I found out about seven or eight years after the club was closed, they found out that there was actually a serial killer that was working at the school. He was like like the night janitor kind of guy and confessed to murdering like a handful of kids that we thought ran away. And he got caught for something else and then confessed to all these murders he had committed over the last decade. And and four of them were kids while he was working up at the campus.  How crazy that was while I was there.  Yeah, bonkers. Fuck. Pretty wild.  So it took you a few years.  Was it a relationship that you were in where a girl was explaining to know what it was while I was talking to former students? Oh, no. I started opening my eyes and I was like, oh, yeah.  So it wasn't talking to someone who wasn't in it, right? It was talking to someone who was in it together. You were like going, hey, I've talked to some other people. And exactly. That's not what 14 year olds do.  Right. Fuck, man. And then when Facebook, it was even longer than that, because I think then when Facebook came out, then it was like there were all these groups and everyone's like, yeah, we were in a cold.  There was a lot of them, I think, in the 60s and the 70s. Yeah, I think there was a lot of them where there was a lot of people that were experimenting with different lifestyles and they're experimenting with drugs. And then there was a lot of people whenever you do drugs around people, there's always people that have answers.  Right. Right. Annoying people that have answers. I'm one of those people. Well, it's like Charles Manson. That's that's right. He gave everybody asinger.  New True Crime podcast, The Lost Kids exposes the twisted, troubled teen industry.  Oh. Oh, wow.  Wow. Schools just came out. Wow. I wonder what kind of timing is this? I got to reach out.  Kind of. The new podcast investigates. Missing teen. Daniel, when I think how you say that you think you. When, Jamie. When, when. Yeah, maybe when. When.  Sorry. Sorry. Daniel and the controversial CEDO school's. Interesting episodes, wow, wow, fascinating. I'll definitely be checking that out. Yemen, there was a whole time where people where, you know, regularly getting together groups of people and getting them to do things and telling them things and telling them, you know, got to drink the Kool-Aid and telling them, you've got to come with me.  We've got to kill that pregnant lady and write pig on the wall. Call that shit came out of cults, all of it, you know, and the Manson one. Fitzsimmons turned me on to this guy that wrote this.  I wrote the book. Yes. Yeah.  Dude, did you heard of it? I've heard all about this guy's name, Tom O'Neil.  And his book is called Chaos Says Chaos. Oh, that's for Charles Manson and the CIA's mind control experiments in the CIA and the secret history of the 60s.  Yeah, we wanted Norm wanted to interview him on our podcast so many times along.  He's amazing. You should have him on because he lived it for 20 fucking years so he can talk to you about it in a depth and with a with a like without even looking at notes. Man, he knows everything about the Manson case. It was his life for 20 fucking years.  Dude, it's crazy. Yeah, that's the book's amazing. It was all the CIA was given, the Macit Manson they kept releasing from jail. He kept violating parole. They'd let him go to let them go. They knew he was doing crazy shit. Let them go. Let him go. They wanted him to get these hippies to do fucked up things because it would disgrace the anti-war movement and get people to be against hippies.  So he literally like let Charles Manson have carte blanche and they think even experimented on him with acid while he was in jail and then he was out of jail. There was a fucking clinic, a free clinic in Haight Ashbury that operated until Tom's book came out. It had been in operation for 30 or 40 fucking years, no more like 50 years from from the 60s. Tom's book comes out and they close it. They closed down this free clinic a couple of months after his book comes out showing that that free clinic was being used in the 1960s by the CIA to dose up hippies and follow them around and do studies on them and then dose up johns in whorehouses.  They set up fake whorehouses with two way mirrors and let these guys take acid. They thought they were getting a drink and they're going to have sex with the prostitute and they would pour acid into their mouth and follow them and fuckin run studies on them.  Fucking crazy. Oh, that was real. It's called Operation Midnight Climax.  A real thing. That's fucking awesome, bro. This Tom O'Neil book blows the lid off of it. Like this is insane.  It's insane.  That's why it's Tim has told me about a Fitzsimons is recommend anybody, but he just goes, you have to get this guy on your podcast. He goes, it's right up your alley and it's fucking crazy.  And when you hear the whole story like, oh, my God, of course, like, holy shit, of course that's fucking oh, of course. Bonkers they fucking.  Here's the thing I was going to talk about. I watched over this past weekend the entire Netflix special on the Unabomber.  There's a four part special on the Unabomber, and it mentions a lot of fucked up things about the Unabomber that I don't want to spoil or anybody. But one thing it kind of leaves out was that he was a part and pretty sure this has been documented of the CIA, LSD, Harvard drug studies. Really? Yeah. Yeah. That he was he was a part of some sort of psychological study in Harvard for three years, by the way, he was he graduated from school early.  So he was at Harvard when he was seventeen. Seventeen year old kid. They're putting him through this psychological study where they humiliate you and break down your ideas and call you a fool. And there's recordings of it, of of him talking to an adult. Seventeen year old kid, talking to an adult who just openly mocking him and his ideas and shitting on him.  And they think they gave these kids the fucking Unabomber. They think they gave these kids acid to. Wow.  And they think they made any one of the things he said it was herpes because they're sadistic, they're being sadistic. It was just like a cult. You give people too much power. They do whatever the fuck they want. In this case, you give people too much power. And they said, you know what? Let's find out what acid does do to beat, but let's find out what happens when you humiliate a kid and break them down and give them acid.  Let's try. And so they would just ruin people's lives. And they did it to a ton of people. Man, that's so fucked. Do they just experiment? They didn't know what acid really was. They weren't exactly sure what it would do or what it could do. They thought it was going to be a truth serum. Then it turns out it's not that like what is it? So they did all kinds of experiments with people and the best way to do them initially was get volunteers.  But after the volunteers were fucking going crazy and losing their marbles and like staring in the corner, like Blair Witch Project knotting back and forth, they ran out of volunteers. So then they started using prisoners and they started using students. They started using a bunch of different people, using people that weren't going to say anything about it. Like Johns at a brothel. Yeah, bro, it's bonkers.  So what was crazy is they didn't mention none of that in the Kazinsky Netflix thing. And I thought that was fascinating because. There was another documentary called The Net, I believe it was a German documentary. It's in subtitles and it was explaining that as well.  But it was going into depth more about the specifics or the LSD studies that they did on them. People are just starting to understand, like there was there really was a time where they were experimenting on people. That's a real thing. I mean, it was going on for a while. They were taking people and running experiments on innocent people. That's this is a part of our history.  Fifty years ago, the only studies I've seen is like the famous videos, like when they give it to like a housewife, there's all this stuff called MK Ultra.  MK Ultra was a real project where they were really experimenting on people to find out what would happen to them.  There's also look, there's there's people that are experts on how to extract information out of people.  You know, there's people that are actually how do you think they get to be those experts?  What do they do with the experiment? What are they experiencing on the probably prisoners? They probably do with prisoners. That's what they did with Charles Manson. They experimented on him with acid and they taught him how to manipulate others with acid, how to use acid to break down societal norms and break down all the structure they had in terms of what was OK and not OK in relationships and their relationship to society, how society was fucking them over, he would force them to have orgies and go, you're going to have sex with her and he's going to have sex with him and put everybody together.  And they all do gay, straight, all acid, all fucked up. And literally he would pretend to take acid and then like, guide them.  Right. And guide their thoughts and program them. And he did it every night.  And everybody was like, well, where do you get the acid? Where's he getting all that acid? Was getting it from the fucking government.  Wow, dude, that's fucking Danker, dude.  Dude, I got to read this, and he was emboldened. First of all, he was a fucking psychopath with a terrible childhood. His childhood was just he was just destroyed by the time he was a grown man, lived half of his life in federal institutions, half of his life from the time he got out before Helter Skelter, half his life, he had been in federal prison. Jesus crazy.  He spent almost his entire life in prison.  He was. And most likely they're pretty sure they were involved in acid studies during that time, at least towards the end before they released.  So they release him and he's been in jail a ton of times for everything, fucking stealing cars, all kinds of shit. Right.  And they release him and he just getting away with things like when he does things like they think he murdered a guy, they think I murdered a guy at the ranch.  The guy disappeared and he confessed to it later, just never found that guy. And then he talks these kids into killing people, talk to these kids and stabbing people and robbing people. And, bro, I mean, it's it's and it keeps getting out. They arrest him for stuff and they keep letting them go. And no one could understand it. Dude, it's nuts is when you when you read the book.  I listen to the audio book I hardly ever read anymore. But when you when you listen to the story, it's at the end of it.  You're like, wow, well, that makes sense. That's what they were probably doing back then, they probably did stuff like that back then, and he connects it to Sirhan Sirhan. Yeah, the guy who killed Robert Kennedy, he connected to Jack Ruby, the guy who shot Lee Harvey Oswald. He thinks, yup, Jack Ruby after this one doctor, this doctor Jolli, this famous LSD doctor from the clinic, went to visit Lee Harvey Oswald excuse me, went to visit Jack Ruby after he shot Lee Harvey Oswald.  When he leaves Jack, Ruby's crawling off the ceiling screaming, yelling. He's delusional, demented. He thinks that there's a new holocaust happening right now and they're lighting Jewish babies on fire in the street. He loses his mind, completely, loses his mind after this guy visits him, after this LSD doctor who worked with Manson.  Dude, that's crazy.  It's the craziest book. You need that book realize. What's the chaos?  I think back in the 50s and 60s, they just try things.  That's a great way to work. Yeah, sure. Just try things like some shit. He just tried things like let's let's see what happens when we do this. Did you see anything about anything about the Unabomber, Ted Kaczynski, and LSD experiments at Harvard?  There he digging through. There's a book that came out called Harvard, The Harvard and the Unabomber.  Digging through here, it doesn't specifically say that those tests had LSD in them, but they were psychological tests that happened at Harvard to undergraduate students in the late 60s, or maybe even they brush it over it right in the documentary, the Netflix thing about how they would use drugs on patients, but they didn't.  They were talking about a variety of methods and they sort of glossed over the fact and drugs. But LSD was a critical part of that because if they dosed him up all the time, they could just rewire them. Right. Like you could rewire someone's brain.  You're just starting from scratch by the book will blow your mind. It already has.  And as it gets further along, it builds. I mean, it's a masterpiece. The guy did it over 20 years. He literally gave up his life searching this thing and then gave birth his 20 year old baby.  It's amazing. I can't wait to see this fucking baby.  But I think, like when I'm watching the Unabomber thing and I'm thinking how many people like that aren't so murderous but lost their fucking mind?  Yeah, exactly. Because of some crazy experiments. Oh, because of someone doing something only back in the 60s.  That's fucking crazy. But it's how is that different than a cult? I mean, it's different in that I guess it's different in that they're not taking you to a place and making a buck.  But it's not in terms of one person with an extraordinary amount of power is using and abusing that power in a way that no one would ever consent to. And they don't understand it. They don't they can't understand it because, you know, in your case, when you're 14, you're a fucking little kid. And in this case, when you're on acid, like they're doctoring your neurochemistry, they're changing the way your fucking brain interfaces with reality and then programming you talking to you.  Anybody who doesn't think that that is insane, that that and when you find out that that actually went on like, well, has anybody been held accountable for that? Like what happened there? And people still deny it to this day, apparently.  But there's been some Freedom of Information Act documents and some other documents they found that were in CIA storage that confirmed the existence of this program and some of the things that they were trying to do. That's so fucking fascinating, and they shut it all down once, this one guy who was running it died. That's it.  Wrap it up, wear out your magic coming on board the CIA like a year later, not having any idea. And everybody's mad. Like what I'm here to I'm looking for terrorists.  The fuck you talking about acid and hookers. What who is doing what I.  There's no documentation of that, like readily available to new recruits.  You know, they don't tell you, you know, you sign up for the CIA, you think you're a good guy who's here to save the world from bad people. Right. And meanwhile, you're coming in right on the heels of the regime that was literally operating whorehouses with to a mere dosing. Plummers up with acid.  Oh, poor guys. You imagine just going to have some sex. Pay someone to touch your body. They give you acid.  They Bill Cosby, you with some fucking acid and then study you. And that's the government and your taxes are all paying for that.  Wow. That's called shit. But that's like that's what people do, man.  If they have that kind of power, if you give people just first of all, also, if you give people that are in the position of like any government agency or police officer, that's seen a lot of violence, they've seen a lot of crazy shit, they've seen like the worst side of people. And then you give them this, like, super secret power where no one could know what they're doing and they can literally ghost people.  They can make people vanish. You could just shoot somebody in the head and throw them in the ocean. No one's going to say anything. Everybody's on your side. You're one of the good guys. People will just do stuff like that, yeah, for sure. They need to be held accountable. Definitely. That's what the rules are for. The rules are for to keep people from being people. Yeah, accountability is very important. Yeah.  You got to keep giving in to the primal people nature, like the primal people.  Nature seems like that's what those cults are, man. It's like just a combination of stupid, uninformed narcissism and that weird primal nature to tell people what to do. Yeah. And bang it all together with some delusional person, with some good vocabulary and some wild stories of what's waiting for them after the Hale Bopp Comet passes overhead and you cut your balls off. It's fucked up. Yeah, it's all fucked up. How did it affect you once you got out and you realized you were out and you talk to all the other people that were out to and you all realized that you were out.  How did it affect that? What did you have to, like, remap those years in your head? Did you have to kind of think about what life is really like?  It was it was interesting because I got out when I was 16, so I had to go out as soon as I got out. I had two more years of high school, so I got thrown down the street. A Taft went to Taft High School in Woodland Hills and then.  Yeah, did a couple more years there. But it was it was tough to get reacclimated and then, yeah, I didn't know I had to retrain my brain.  Like I felt like I, I knew it was almost like I knew what they were trying to do. I almost felt like I was being brainwashed and we were taught to self police each other.  And and I was like North Korea style with each other out. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Otherwise, you know, they would put you on a full time and you'd have to fucking dig out a stump for.  So when you say we were forced to self please each other, we forced itself please yourself or other guys ourselves and others.  Oh OK. So you have the right to. Yeah.  You have to write a dirt list every week, which is basically every rule.  Here's another way. The government's fucking kind of cult, they were doing that in L.A. They were asking people to find people who weren't social distancing. Yeah. And report them and then report businesses that were operating during quarantine. You get a reward, call this hotline, call this number. Be arat, be a bitch. Yeah, be a bitch.  There should be a number if you want to be a bitch. But when they call those numbers, they should have your phone number and then when you go to vote, they should go. Oh, look, turns out you're a bitch.  I could you did stupid. I was barbecuing in his backyard without a mask on. You called the fucking feds.  You creeps. People are so crazy. There's so absolute and so angry.  Yeah, it's insane to. Yeah. I don't know man. And then so I got out. Mm. Yeah.  How do you recover. How do you let go. Hey this is all bullshit.  I think it took some time, it took, it took years but I was one of the lucky ones. I was like you know what, I did it. I took, I took the positives. I was like, you know what, it wasn't all bad. I learned some tools and if I didn't go through that, I wouldn't be the person I am today. And I'm not the you know, I'm not the worst fucking guy in the world.  So I made it out. I survived. Fuck it. Right. I'm not going. There were a lot of people that wouldn't let go. They would just hold on. And to this very day, they hold on so tight to this bitterness and this anger and they they can't sleep at night. And all they think about is what they went through.  They lost three years of their life.  I do hate that. I do bummed out that I missed out those three years of not of this script get sold.  Yeah, that's true. Come on, man.  That's true. That's earned. Correct. Exactly. It's like, you know, we're talking about with Joey Diaz, like you earned this.  I totally I not only do I not regret it, there's many, many, many more days than not that I wish I could go back and do it all over again.  I swear to God. Why? I don't know.  Because I just thought about it was there was there was a camaraderie. There was it was like there was something about it. I didn't have to I had all that other bullshit to worry about, but I didn't have to worry about a roof over my head job. You know, all the other bullshit that you have to worry about prison.  Yeah. You get institutionalized. Exactly. Yeah.  I heard stories about people even in the Holocaust because you know what they and you know what the reason I think it's a very small percentage of people that would have wanted to go back to that, but they said it's because they felt alive.  A lot of people said that about war in general. But during the war, they feel like the stakes are so high and everything's turned up to 11. You know, I think that's what we're talking about when we're talking about the pandemic, the early days of the pandemic. I felt like there's going to be a good for people. It's going to be a little bit of a lesson.  But I'm much more cynical now.  Yes, because now I see that this is everyone's going to survive, but they're going to be broke and they're going to be I mean, it's going to harden people's differences instead of force people to abandon a lot of the foolish stuff and concentrate on what's important, keeping our loved ones and our family alive, keeping each other alive and doing the right thing and protecting ourselves from this invasion of demons, invisible demons that can kill your grandpa.  Yeah, but then when we realized it wasn't that, then everybody sort of settled into this boredom. Everybody settled into, like watching TV all day and eating too much. And then that shit talking on Twitter got to the point where I'm like, I don't even want to read you guys anymore. Yeah. So this is everyone so angry.  There's so much anger. And until things bounce back to a steady place, I don't think that's going to resolve itself.  Well, it's a very divisive issue, you know, but I do hope that some of us, the wise amongst us, some of us that are that like to think about things are going to look at this and go, maybe my priorities were out of whack.  Yeah. Maybe I was working too much. Maybe I should have just tried to enjoy life and had more adventures and just appreciated people and just more dinners with wine, you know, laughing and hugging each other and just more having fun because there's so much of so much of life is really horseshit. Yeah.  Really it's hard to it's hard to recognize it when it's right in front of you.  And it's it demands your attention, but it's not the same thing as losing your life. And when that virus came along, like post 9/11, everybody kind of became nicer for a little bit. Yeah. I'm hoping that more of us than not will be able to recapture that.  I hope so. Just just hold on to what is actually important.  And I hope that sooner rather than later.  I also hope that people that have been thinking about doing something but there have been held back by this idea that you're going to play it safe. You realize there's no safe. Yeah, so good. So write that book, start stand up, make that album fuckin start sculpting whatever the fuck you're thinking about doing, man. Just go and do it. Go on doing get out there man.  I don't kidnap a bunch of people and give them acid.  I think that's been done. All right. Turns out terrible shit.  When are you going to do your thing with Norm again. You're going to have to.  We've been planning for a while now, so now we're just going to we just need to put all the nuts and bolts into place and then get a go studio, get a camera and just do it. But you're going to be the first guest I'm in.  All right, good. So just tell me when so I can plan ahead.  We're shooting the first one in the fall, so.  Oh, OK. So, you know, are you going to plan it all? Are you going to map it out in advance? Nice. I can't wait too though. Yeah.  You know, I mean, listen, I love normed pieces. He's one of my all time favorite human beings, Samier, that have ever lived.  I have a great story about Naum, me and him on a plane and randomly. This is crazy, but true randomly. Twice I sat next to him on planes. Just random. Oh, wow.  Yeah, totally random. Like, what's up, Norm? What's up, Norm? Like crazy. This is happening again. And both times it was a blast. But one time we're we're flying back and he's like, yeah, I used to smoke and I had to give it up. It's fucking terrible for you. But I sometimes I miss it, but glad I quit. I'm like, well, you know, how long has it been? He's telling me all these months you stop smoking this.  Now we're talking as soon as he when he walks right into the fucking store, buys a carton of cigarettes and he's opening this cigarette, he's lighting it before he gets out the door and I go, what do you do? It goes all that talk about smoke. And I had to have one.  And the flight from from I forget where we were two times, both times are just like the best flights, like just like having an audience of one next to one of the greatest comics ever.  Just talk shit. Yeah. He's probably, you know, he's he's probably like in my top three favorite standup comics of all time. And he's a great guy.  He's a he's a great guy.  He's got the two greatest people in my life in comedy have been Norman SPAD. They've just been so good to me and I love them both. And they're both equally hilarious in different ways. But Norm, I'll never forget how quick he was and good. He was hosting that podcast.  We had Larry King on one time and Larry was like, no, I'm I don't think they're going to give you a show, you know, because he was just fucking outlandish saying the most crazy fucking shit to Larry King Lear is like, you know what, Norm? He's like 50 is in the radio business. The one thing I learned is I never I rarely talk. I always listen. That's why I always learn from the guests, because I'm always listening.  Can I interrupt you there?  So I can't wait to I can't wait to come back with this podcast.  Norm is the hidden king of the Internet. If he decided to have a podcast, it would be the biggest podcast of all time. If you just do a regular basis.  I know we just need to get motivated. He's Buckwild do. Yes. And he's always been always he's there's whatever the filter it doesn't even screw in his head. Like there's not there's no filter. There was never a place for it. The Charles Manson of comedy. And he loves Manson. Does it really? We're going to we'll definitely get O'Neal on. No way.  He's he's a Manson fiend. Huge. How much does he know about the case? I think he knows. I'm sure he's read the books. He's read that book.  That Chaos book. OK, yeah. Good. I need to talk to him about it. Yeah, you have to. Well, listen, brother, did I kill you.  Always good. We got it. But we got to do this at the VIP bar. Yes. Next time I see you, I hope we're we're at the Comedy Store and this shows tell everybody your Instagram so they could tell you that Adam say a lot of yes.
