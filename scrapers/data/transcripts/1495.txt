It gives you real data on how hard you're working out, how much your body's recovering, and it works on something called heart rate variability because it monitors your heart all day long and through. It's this fantastic algorithm. It takes this mountain of data and it gives you actionable information that you could judge, like how much sleep you need. It has a sleep coach tell you based on what time you have to get up, when you should be going to bed so you can be recovered.  It also set exertion goals for you and give you target exertion goals with its strain. Coach lets you know how you're progressing. You get all this feedback, you see how you felt, how the workout went, and it adds all this data up and it lets you know how you're really improving and how your body is really working. I love it. I'm a big fan. It just gives it gives you real instead of going on feel it gives you real information to how good your body's doing and what you need to do differently.

Please welcome the powerful and amazing Kyle Dunn.  The government has announced that you will gain experience trying by day, podcast by night, all day. Kyle Dunnigan, smoking marijuana, this is dangerous. They're going to go crazy, you think? Yes. Don't you watch those movies? I forgot about that.  Yeah. Pot drugs will make you crazy. They'll make you nuts. Are you talking about those old videos, the old timey black and white where they live from madness? Yeah.  Yeah. Do you know where those are? Those were funded by William Randolph Hearst, was that right? Yeah, that piece of shit.  He was a piece of shit. All right. But yeah. And his daughter brought a gun into a bank.  Wow. Right. Maybe you want to protect her money. She's rich as fuck. So she's robbing a place. You have the wrong person. Patty Hearst. Patty Hearst. That's right. Yeah.  Must be related. Right. What is she, the granddaughter? I think she's the granddaughter because she's too young to be the daughter.  I'd like to. We have no information. Let's go with it. But let's broadcast it to millions. Write this down here. Get a better. Yeah. Patty Hearst. Yeah, that's interesting story.  Well, William Randolph Hearst is also the reason why this wild pigs in California. How was that? Because that asshole brought them to his ranch. He wanted to have a menagerie. I think that's the correct term menagerie of animals. He's a nutty person. You could visit Hearst Castle. It's this crazy place. Yeah. Yeah. I want to go there. It's so Northern California has kind of an infestation of wild pigs. And it's because directly because of William Randolph Hearst, really, the pigs that left his compound to start fucking and running through the woods like there it is.  That's that's the place I feel you could solve that.  Look, it's fornaro not hard to solve. Wild pigs are the hardest animal to solve in terms of like invasive species because they fuck like crazy and they breed like three times a year. So one pig can have like three litters in a year. So the pigs love to fuck.  They are always dirty pigs or something in Hawaii where they had some infestation and they brought in this other animal to get it, but they brought the wrong animal and then that became the infestation again, something I don't have enough information about.  Yeah, I think that's a I think you're incorrect about that because for something that could kill pigs, it would have to be a big predator like a cow.  Oh, no, this wasn't pigs. Like a different infestation.  Why? It was OK. It was slightly related to your story.  Well, I know they did that in Australia. Australia fucked themselves up hardcore.  They brought in animals to kill animals and those animals wound up running amok and killing them. That's what always seems to happen. Yeah, they brought in cats like house cats. They have an infestation of wild house cats in Australia.  That's kind of cute. It's better than but it's sick because of bow hunters are like paid to hunt.  Cats like people are paid bounties for house cats. So an Australian hunting magazines, you'll see guys holding up a house cat. What do you get per cat?  I don't think you get a lot, but I can't think can't live off your cat.  I think it's tells I don't think it's not like beaver pelts or anything like that. It's really valuable.  How high is this going to make? I got to we're already gone. We already got really hit it four times.  I'm already not starting off with a lot of IQ points. I can't come down two points for spitting facts, son. Yeah. Yeah. The Wild A&M fucking Wildcats.  You're the one who told me about the the mustard weed.  And once you said that I cannot see mustard weed and the crazy, I think it came from Russia, that crazy, beautiful yellow weed that covers the hills in California. It's really pretty. You know, it's awesome. I thought it was pretty. You told me it was a weed. No, I think it was gross. Isn't that weird?  You call one plant, one thing another. It's a fucking plant you like. We're really racist with plants. We are plants. You know, we're plants. So if you see like a beautiful green grass, but it's got some weird, like daisies popping up. People get mad at those daisies. They're nice daisies growing in my grass. I go pluck them, rip them out of their life. Fuck you. You're not what I want.  Yeah, they're very I have a problem with that.  They want uniform just on the grass. Right. Right. And then a weird thing that we do a lawn is a weird thing. How so? We're controlling nature on a large scale in our own community, our own little yard.  We have a little spot and we lock it down. We want that grass, nice plant, that crest, nice and cut cleaner to thing like people sit back.  Look what is happening with grass. Like when you see great. Why does it make you feel so good? Like I don't play golf but I feel good when I see a golf course. I see all that green like oh that's nice.  I guess it is, it's uniform. You could walk on it. There's no danger.  It's nice for your feet, but it's also you you controlled that shit like men took that grass and bend it to their will.  Yeah. That feels good. Yeah. Yeah. Fuck you. Yeah. Fuck you only nigga.  Fuck you. Trees you ever get you ever go weeding. Yeah. Fuck trees people chop trees down. Fuck off tree. I don't want you there. That the man this job the lumberjack. Oh for sure.  How many chick lumberjacks are there. Three. Those got to be the toughest women on the planet.  Lumberjack chicks like it's like female Memphians like Amanda Nunez and then lumberjack chicks after the after.  A chainsaw, though, it's a little bit like it's still as dangerous as fuck, you've got to do it right. Things go wrong all the time. People get hit with trees.  We've talked about everything. I don't know anything about me, too.  I don't know what I'm talking about. Maybe people never get hit by trees. Pretty sure they do, I think is actually pretty safe. It turns out lumberjacks never died. Yeah, they live older than everybody. No, I think they think they die all the time, I think. Well, I just there if you see a fucking tree like a big ass oak tree. My God, that's a lot of weight. Yeah. That thing could crush you.  So if you fuck up and it hits, it takes a bounce and it hit somebody or I mean you chop trees down, but you just deal with so much weight. Yeah. I can imagine like someone like you don't know what you're doing, you're an asshole and you just bought a plot of land. I'm going to be a farmer and used to chop down trees by yourself. Yeah. You could kill yourself. Easy.  You get to the wedge. I know what I'm talking about. All right, I don't know what I'm talking about either, but they do have a method to it. But but I wonder how many women that would be a crazy reality show. They probably have already done it. The female lumberjacks. Yeah, they had that lumber.  They do that weird thing where they climb a pole real quick. They do lumberjack contest contests.  And he's like, yeah, I remember those. You run on a log in the water. Right. The logs that comes up, you know, when you're crossing the street. That's a lumber.  Jill No. Jack Oh, is that what they call it? Just looked it up. Oh, OK. I didn't mean to be disrespectful. I just talk a lot. Shit.  A lot of guys wanting the lumber Joe calendar, you know what I mean? Right. Right. Oh, there are some big ass women.  Big, strong women will fuck you up. You like a strong woman, Joe? Yeah, a big I don't want to can't carry things. Oh yeah.  She's these are girls are throwing axes and shit. Oh, my God. Yeah, that's a tough stock if you want to make like a warrior child, you find with women. Yeah, they can get through a winter. Oh yeah. Yeah they can. They can walk to the road. Did you find a lumberjack TV show?  I think he did.  See, we just took a guess and there's a fucking show about it is a show that everything you know, there's a fun game to play. We're like try to name and come up with an app that doesn't exist. And it's actually really hard.  Oh, my God. I would imagine there's a bunch of wizards with really smart kids sitting around trying to do that right now.  Yeah, I didn't take the picture with the sword.  Is that at the end you can take a picture with a sword. Awesome. And don't you have like this like whiskey you give everybody. Do you want some whiskey? Is this too much. No. Sure. No. Come a little. A little bit.  Haven't seen you in forever. But with the communist store embargo, it's just beautiful to be in the room with you.  I know it actually is really nice. It's fun humans. Oh it's so nice to be with comics. Yeah. Like Doug Stanhope said his best and I quote him all the time, but it really is a great quote. He said, I quit comedy, but I couldn't quit comics. Oh that's nice. Yeah.  Yeah I when I'm around Normie, Normie, Normie Norman's like I started dating.  This was my big year to date. I'm like because I've been focusing on my career stuff, whatever I'm going to date in 2020. Wow. This is my big year and covid.  Yeah. But I got an aps, I met a couple of girls I was chatting with bored out of my I mean sweet nice people.  But just when you don't know someone trying to do with it being a comic, it's like if you've never met them, you're not, you know, hooking up and having dinner or whatever just to talk to a stranger on the phone about their cat.  It's I had to end all that.  Some people don't know what it sounds like when they talk. Yeah.  They just drone on and they don't seem to know.  Yeah, you're like, oh, my God, you're killing me. You're not even paying attention to that.  I'm not. I can't take what you're saying. Yeah. Read the room.  Just blah, blah. Some people just have some shit in their head and they're going to get it out. They're going to vomit it out onto your ears.  It's a bit like a it doesn't matter how long it takes. Yeah. And they get to repeat themselves and they're going to like, make a big deal out of shit. That's not a big deal.  And you're going to want to run through a fucking wall. Yeah, but, you know, listen, all that is so maddening.  It feels like your your life is passing you by and you're dying.  It is maddening. But the good thing is what it really does.  I'm a bright side of the coin, the bright side of the coin.  I believe it's not a real expression. I was I mixed up my expressions. I'm a glass. The glasses came down. I'm a glass. The glass half full of coins.  I'm. I don't know, this is the good stuff, right? The Buffalo Trace, so I got to be someone's got to put a little cap on me.  Dude, I'm so sorry. I forgot we were talking about. No, I feel bad for any listener. We want to make a public apology. Already we fucked this thing up.  We're both having trouble thinking to two thousand twenty two thousand.  The greatest year of all this is what do they call it, a mulligan. Those dudes who play golf. How do you get on?  What's Amulya mean? You get a do over.  Let's just scratch this whole year that I'd like to toast to things people don't agree with at the last minute. They're very committed to 9/11 and they articling. How rude.  And I think there's going to be a lot of good that comes out of this here.  I really do this. I like talking about positive stuff. What do you think it is? Well, I think people are realizing that society and civilization hangs on by a thread in some cases. And, you know, in a series of events can happen. It could derail our life radically. And I don't think people were really aware that that was possible before. I think there's a lot of things going on.  There's a lot of competing mindsets and competing ideologies and there's a lot of anger going on in the world right now. And then there's this fucking fear that comes with a pandemic. Everything like pandemics ramp up, everything like this. I have to think about it. We're thinking about it. It's just a pandemic. But it's also there's a mind disease, like a fear disease that's sweeping through the land, too.  And I feel like it's like like your your your resources are being used up in so many different directions that it's like you're a little overrun. It's one of the reasons why people reacting so violently to things lately. There's everything is just ramped up. And I feel like there's there's like a certain level of other things that you can tolerate in your life when you have so many things compounding and piling on top of each other. It's like the reason why they say that people get road rage is because it's not just here in a car and someone does something stupid, but your your senses are heightened because, you know, you're going sixty miles an hour.  So you're very aware. It's a very different feeling. Right. I didn't even consider that thought when I first heard about, I thought road rage. Just people being a pussy like you being mean while you're locked in this little box because you know, you can't nobody can say anything to you.  Yeah, but it's not just that. It's fear, like because you're fucking driving fast and it's like if everybody fucks up, someone's texting you don't want in your lane, you could die. So because of that, because we have this in our head, it causes us to be like extra ramped up. And I think that's how we are right now with everything because of covid. Even if you don't have covid, even if you're not worried about covid, what it's done is has made everybody ramp up.  So everybody's almost got road rage. So everybody's like a little bit more stressed out than they've ever been before. A little bit more ramped up and everything gets exaggerated and everything gets blown out. Yeah. And there's so many more instances of scary things that you're being seen in the news and so few instances of really nice things. Yeah. And it's like, fuck, what a weird combination of things to try to manage. Yeah.  I, I've never raged before in my life like screamed and raged. And then when this thing happened I, it was, it took me where I had a few times. Right. Raged.  It's understandable. It's totally understandable. Yeah. But it's totally understandable.  I mean we're all expected to manage our energy and our anxiety and we're expected to do it perfectly.  We're expected to be exactly who we were four or five months ago before all this had happened. I think that's crazy. Yeah, I think people are under, like, mad, fucking weird stress that we've never experienced before. Right. The economic stress, the stress of the virus. I think we just need to fucking make a collective global effort, a collective effort to just be nicer to each other. I think it's possible. I think we can realize that.  Yeah, look what can happen. Look how sideways everything can get. We just get lost and go in the woods or let's work together. Let's like, what do you want? Do you don't you want nice neighbors? I want nice neighbors. So if I want nice neighbors, don't I want a whole nice city. Don't know a whole nice community. Don't I want a whole nice country. Why is that impossible.  It feels like people are communicating well recently I think high end some people are trying. It's just it's hard to like there's too much of our time is spent communicating on social media stuff. It's too much time. Yeah, it's OK. It's too one dimensional and it's too it's too frequent. So it's too many interactions. We're not getting like real real human feedback. You're not getting real love. You're not getting real friendship. You're talking just to the ether like you're typing things into glass.  And, you know, on the other end someone's going to interpret it. Yeah, but it's a it's just the worst way to communicate.  And that's most of what people are doing today. So the most ineffective, unemotional, unconnected way to communicate is the. Most common, right, and that's why we're acting like fucking nuts. Do you part of do you think we can back off that? Yes, we can go back up. Can I get a flip phone?  That's been the problem.  The whole flip phone flip phones just have to get better text recognition software or voice to text recognition software. So you could just talk your messages into a flip phone so all anybody could do is text you and call you. Just leave me off of everything else.  Oh, come on, Rup text.  People are just too worked up. They're too worked up about everything. Well that's things they should be worked up about. But the problem is, is no balance because it's almost all the stuff that they're angry about because that's what they want to text and tweet and Facebook about. And very little of the stuff like what's the ratio of like really cool stories like that make you feel good to like another horror in the news.  What's the ratio? Ninety something to one. Ninety seven to one. There's a new one. There's a cloud of dust that's coming from Africa across the fucking ocean. It's to rise out really.  This year is like the devil scripted this year. What is it. What does this dust. I don't know man.  I didn't know dust could fly that far all the way across the ocean in that crazy. Where is it right now?  Like, I know it's something I got to we're at DEFCON five or some shit. What happens?  It's just I don't know. I just read it. I was like, oh my God. And they said, Yellowstone is ready to blow.  That scares me the most. The most.  The most. We're pretending we're over here pretending that this is all permanent.  Happens a few times a year. Oh, does it really fairly common.  But what is it? Oh, what does it do? Oh, this is blown out of proportion for the news. I think just the headline sounds crazy. Headline sounds terrible. The one I found says it's a silver lining, so it's actually kind of maybe a good thing.  Oh, signifies a dry, very dry layer in the atmosphere. And hurricanes don't like dry air so.  Oh oh well that's good. OK. Oh see we jumped the gun.  That was a great story. How at that. How about hurricanes. How about the fact that every fucking year the sky becomes a monster and eats.  People can get through, throws cars through the air and shit every year it happens and it's getting it's getting worse right now. The fire is getting worse.  Right. They say that and it makes sense.  It's getting worse. And this is not an excuse for like the carbon emissions. This makes it sound way worse. What is. Oh, my gosh. Is enormous cloud of dust from Africa. Sahara appears to be heading for Texas, Louisiana and Florida. It's like it's a missile.  And then they show a dust storm like taking over a city. Oh, my God. Is that really what it was like? I don't think so. I mean, that's not what the other article I just showed that video, though.  What does it say? Massive dust storm turns the sky red and Sudanese capital some.  Wafaa Oh, my God, man. Look at that. I was in Mission Impossible for I think. Was it. Yeah, he was on that guy, right?  He got caught in the dust storm coming. Yeah. To the man living there and seeing that common. I'm like, oh, my God, I'm going to be breathing dirt for the next hour, I cullum's at last. How is a dust storm last to imagine living there, man? You're going to go to the grocery store and you're literally walking through a dust storm. So you dressed like one of them dudes from the Lord of the Rings. Right.  Right.  You fucking squashed across your face like, no, the guy's in Star Wars.  What are they called the. They are the ones who lived like in the dirt and the sand people. Sand people.  Yeah. I don't think that was the name.  There's also the little of the little ones. Yeah, there was a bunch of those were the God damn it. But those same people now he walks with a fluffy one. But who are the sand people.  Yeah. Maybe that's it. Yeah I think that's it.  They're called Javas. They're called Jawa. Are they. Sounds right. I'm going to go Jawa. I believe you.  I think we should do a whole podcast of things we kind of know about and stuff and do it already doing it.  I don't, I don't think I mean, look, there's no way that's the weather just stays the same. It doesn't stay. It's never started. It doesn't.  But we have to listen to climatologist 100 percent.  Yeah, 100 percent. I don't know why it drives me nuts, but I just. But this is my point of view. Like, legitimately, we have a bigger concern. One of the bigger concerns is we're not prepared if anything goes sideways. And that's what we're finding from this covid we're not really prepared if things go sideways. Yeah. And we definitely should be protected against the human impact on the climate change. It's real. We really have fucked up the earth how ever, even if we didn't fuck it up, this this place is so unstable, even if it wasn't us, the asteroids, the hurricane that just exist and have always existed.  Earthquakes. Yeah, we just we just don't live long enough to see enough of these to be scared of them.  Yeah. Because our lives are so fucking short. Yeah. And the life of the earth is so long that these, all these tectonic plates like when we go to a mountain like wow, that's really pretty. Look what happened.  It's alive. Yeah. But things move on right now. There's lava under it. If you saw like 10000 years a second, you would just see the whole earth just.  Oh yeah, yeah. Oceans come in and out and it's constantly doing that. It's always done that. We definitely should stop fucking up the world that we're living in the world that we exist in. But even if we didn't, this is so dangerous. Yeah, this whole place is covered with predators. We are just super lucky. We killed most of them off and boxed ourselves away.  And some people stuff those pictures. We've got to figure out that asteroid. We're not looking at enough of the sky.  No, we're looking at three percent to and you get different answers from different folks when you ask them how long it would take before they could deflect some stuff. Forget it. I think Neil deGrasse Tyson, what does he say? Ten years. Do you remember?  You got to do like you got to figure out how you're going to do it. And Jesus, bro. Yeah, Jesus, it's too big. There's nothing you can do. I mean, if it's too big, there's nothing you could do.  But I, I don't know, we could get a just you have one week to live.  Just could come on the news today.  We just saw this asteroid. Oh yeah. They said the Mayan calendar is supposed to technically and next week. Oh Jesus.  That thing always comes up though and it's never anything. You know, what shocks me is when you have it, the leader of a cult and they have doomsday and the date in the time, they all go outside and they sing and it doesn't happen. And then that guy convinces them to stay and he goes, no, it's a different day. Yes.  And they all just it was a guy who was taking out billboards.  There was a billboard in Woodland Hills on Ventura Boulevard, and it had this fucking billboard and he had a bunch of them all over the place. But they had this billboard that showed the very day the earth was going to end, like it was like it had a date on it. Do you remember it? I don't want to say it was like somewhere around April or May not. Scientists says reading Mayan calendar predicts end of the world this week.  But first they said, oh, OK, whatever.  This year it's in New York a little bit. Thank you. The Post is trolling you, son. I like that.  We listen to people who just like put leeches on people that care according to the sun.  Actually better. You know what? When they they did have a weird culture, the Mayans had a weird culture. It's I don't know much about it.  I know the temple and they they didn't they kill virgins.  I don't think they killed mom. Who knows? This is great. I don't know about this topic. I don't know if they really know what exact people they killed. They killed a lot of people. But what's really interesting is how beautiful their structures were, like these amazing structures, one of their pyramid, like those big steps.  Yeah, one of them was for murder for their crops.  They've they've speculated that there was certain platforms that they would do sacrifices on the Aztecs. Did, I think the most sacrifices in one day and or it was like a couple of days. They killed somewhere around, I want to say.  I want I want to say more than 80000 people, they sacrificed when they yeah, when they completed this one of the temples, how do you feel that maybe they bury them or they just killed them one after another?  That takes a toll on the victims of human sacrifice by Mexico's ancient Mayans who threw children into water filled caverns where likely boys and young men, not virgin girls, as previously believed. So they would human sacrifice by throwing children into water filled caverns.  I could see how kids can imagine that, like you believe in superstitions so much, you want to drown a kid so that so that the crops come back.  That's a sign you are feeling out of control.  They don't know the answers to something they can't figure out, but how crazy the people in almost all religions, especially the ancient ones, they they lean towards these really ridiculous things like that.  Yeah. Whose sacrifice brings that up? What if we do this to kill our kids? Yeah, so make a sacrifice like Cain and Abel, right.  And if you're God wanted that your God wanted you to kill your children, that's a horrible God that.  Or how about your God tells you to kill somebody when you're about to says, no, stop.  I was just testing. That's a fucked up story. I mean, that is fueling people to act like that's a normal story.  That's the God that makes the universe told you to murder somebody. And since you said, yes, you did the right thing by saying yes, because you have to trust God, even if God tells you something that you can't imagine is real.  Right. Even if you know in your gut it's wrong to murder your kid, you have to murder your kid because God's telling you to. And you were about to. You like, OK, good. I was just checking tat tat, tat tat.  I like you now. Just the biggest bully asshole.  Metzger is actually a religious genius. Yeah.  He knows a lot about religion and he was explaining to me the story of he gave me a much better understanding of the story where I think his name's Alicia. These kids were yelling at him when they called him Bald Head is a bald guy. And so he asked God to sic a Schieber on the kids and it killed like forty kids.  She bear this. I wish I could remember exactly what what Metzker how he explained it to me.  But it was the insult was much worse than just calling him bald head. You just have to, you have to put it into perspective with the time like the way he was saying it to him was much worse than we would imagine. The term would be where we're looking at it in terms of modern language. But am I still the guy God sick to bear on these fucking kids? I think you him saying that it might might have meant that they actually were trying to kill the man.  Yeah. From their allies who went to Bethel as he was walking along the road. Some boys came out of town and jittered him. Get out here, Baldy's. They said, get out of here, Baldie. He turned around and looked at the oak, the curse. This is I think that's a real weird translation. I don't think that's the best translation. The way I've heard it before is not written exactly that way. They have more than one translation, tons of translation.  He turned around, looked at them and called down a curse on them in the name of the Lord. The two bears came out of the woods and mauled forty two of the boys.  I got a bear story, it seemed when I heard it before.  Maybe I'm wrong, but if it felt like it was in the ancient way of saying it, and that was what Metzker explained to me. See if there's finally another there's another. There's another way of putting the words together that Metzger was saying no they were going to kill his version.  I was like tons of translations of holy shit so that there's lots of versions unless they were trying to kill the guy, maybe we're looking at it wrong and they were actually trying to kill the guy.  And I think that's one of the things that Metzker was trying to say, like they were threatening violence to the guy sent a bear since I think Tuberose didn't say two bears. Yeah. This is two female bears.  Two she bears dude I was called due to and he's six bears on. You don't fuck with him again. That's rude.  I was in a tent in the woods of Yosemite and I was with this girl he was dating and that before we packed up the ranger I was like, hey, don't have any food anywhere tied up in a tree.  Those bears are coming out of hibernation and they're hungry. Don't have a gum in your pocket, you know, really scared us. We were the little group were kind of laughing that night, like whatever. Like they're just trying to scare everybody.  And then a horror movie it is.  Yeah. He's about to get murdered. Always giggling about something. Yeah. So we're in the tent and about an hour and a sleep. I had brought a knife in my, you know, tent this this size snout pushes into the tent, puffs her head, they grab. But then it comes over to my head, puffs my head. Oh my God. And I had the thought, oh, this is what terror feels like because I'd never felt the emotion before.  I'd never actually been terrified to that moment. And we just held each other's hands, like, really hard and just you did everything not to breathe for two hours, just making the smallest amount of air come in your body.  I have a theory about that. I think bears of figuring out that there's meat in those bags.  I think they've figured out that there's just like eggs, just like they find like when bears go to garbage cans. Yeah.  You can't you can't scare them off.  They're always going to keep coming back to that garbage can. Once they go to the garbage can, they become a problem. They have to kidnap them and move them to some sanctuary somewhere. Otherwise they'd have to euthanize them because once they know where something is, they keep going back. Yeah, they're not scared bears and have killed people in tents. They keep coming back. They keep coming back to the tents.  Yeah, they're killers.  I've heard of more than one different story about a predatory black bear attacking people in a tent. And the thing is, there's less deer in the place if there's been a bad climate, there's not enough food.  Why don't they attack us more? Do you mean like because we have guns? That's the only reason why. And in places where people don't hunt bears, they have way less fear of people.  I mean, I think they would want to get us for food immediately, like, oh, there's some food. They don't know exactly what we are. We're not a part of the natural world. We only occur every now and then.  If you run into a grizzly bear in Alaska, you might be the first person that grizzly bears ever seen. They might not have any idea with you what you are because so it's been alive for nine years. You just never seen a person that's that's totally possible. You saw Grizzly Man, right? Yes, I did.  It's one of the best comedies that wasn't supposed to be a comedy ever. It is so funny. It's wall to wall. Laughs That scene where he's at the lake and the bears walk up to him and he's going, no.  Yeah. Bad. Yeah, someone told me, I don't know.  That's true. But the bears could sense there was something wrong with them. That's why I didn't eat them earlier. I thought he was like he had some sort of a dental disease.  I don't think those bears up there are that aggressive because there's so much fish. And I think when when the when the fish runs dry, that's when they get real dangerous.  Yeah. He went and he was there long after they were supposed to be in hibernation.  So the one bear that killed him was really hungry. It hadn't eaten enough food. Yeah. So it looked at anything and like he was just going to eat everything that was in front of it. And so it found him in Kilner. So they were saying he should never be around when those bears are in hibernation. If you find one that should be in hibernation and it's not, that's a desperate bear.  OK, so to the fact that the whole movie's just fuck that. Like, why are you doing that?  Why you camping or, you know, the bears walk and he's not saving any man, saving these bears. He was so crazy. Yes. Where are you guys? Tiger King down here? He was he was very similar. I got together with Tiger King. That be a great show.  Well, you know what's similar about it? There's something about weird guys to get really connected to murderous animals.  There's some sexual. Yeah, some weird shit, whether it's a tiger or a grizzly bear. So I'm here protecting them. Yeah. Like this dude is in Alaska in a paper house. He's got a bit of a cloth and he's laying on top of the ground every night protecting these fucking twelve hundred pound wild dog things. Yeah.  And he almost got the role of Woody in the film, remember. Yeah. Which is not true.  It's not true. No. He's a crazy person, but he's also a crazy person that found like a venue for his crazy that he did some good too.  And here's one thing that he did. It's good. And I'm not being facetious. That movie's brilliant. It's an amazing piece of entertainment. Through that movie, millions of people have been entertained. I don't think he would have been able to do that without absolutely not.  So it was funnier than cheers.  It was fucking great in that guy's dying that way. It's a tragic story. It's a it's a lesson to be learned. And it's also hilarious. There's there's it's he did it on purpose. Werner Herzog is a really smart guy. He made that thing funny on purpose. You think so?  Well, that sheriff looks at the camera goes, I thought he was retarded. Tell me. Tell me. That wasn't like a scene in a fucking. Yeah. You know, a Coen Brothers movie.  He was. And he has there he he dangled that tape in front of the poor guy's mother.  He was like, oh, you don't want to listen to this. He kept telling her that.  Yeah, yeah, that was crazy. When they played the there's an audio apparently of the death.  It's not available online because Werner Herzog told him to destroy it. And I think he's probably right on that.  But it's long, man. The bear is eating them.  Just eat them alive.  That's maybe the worst way to go. Maybe fire. I don't the problem with a bear eating your lives, I think it takes a long time. Yeah. Because they're not killing her like a tiger would just kill you quick. Yeah. They grab been great eating you from your feet down. You know, they don't give a fuck you. You're tearing your fucking crotch apart while you're alive. Yeah.  That and do do you understand what they'll be like to watch a bird eat you dick first. Dick I thought you dick first a bear just right at your crotch.  Oh big fucking giant bear head clamped down on your dick in your asshole.  And you go in now and that's how you die. A lot of people die that way, man. I guarantee you if you how many people got attacked, Dick first by giant grizzly bears over the course of the last twenty thousand years, I bet it would be a shock.  No surprise you. Yeah.  He'd be like, why are we keeping these things around? That's one thing California did is really wise. They exterminate all the grizzly bears, is that right?  That's on the fly. Grizzly bears on the flags, no grizzly bears here. I didn't know that. They're like, fuck you. Hey, you keep eating us a are you big camp? Do you go camping?  I have I like I like rooftop camps, like where you could camp on the rooftop. They have rooftop tents. They could have a roof rack on my Land Cruiser. I want to climb up the ladder. I want to get that were your camping.  But things aren't just kind of fucking crawl up on you. Yeah. You know, I don't get that cyber truck because that is a great camping situation.  Plus, you look like you're in the future. Yeah. Fucking camping in that thing. I find that's some Blade Runner shit.  I love my car, like in a way that I've never liked something I've bought before.  It feels like it's another thing, right. Like it's way better than a car.  It is. And it's learning and getting better.  And it feels like a child learning growing up and help. Yeah.  You keep getting these new updates. Yeah. And Christmas it drives itself. Ingall Doodoo just drives it.  So amazing because I bought mine in 2018 and how it's gotten so much better.  I mean they're solving vision which I think should be bigger news than what it is. And the way they are doing it is brilliant. They have people paid the money for them to send out all these athletes and they get all the data. Yes. What they need tons and tons of data.  And it's they see stoplights and stop signs. Now, I kind of watched a video on how they they did this. And it's they send out to the fleet like, hey, send us all your stop signs and they all come back to this one place and it learns. And I got a stop sign in my house and just a little piece is showing is covered by bushes and but the car recognizes it too, just and that's his side job, that that's a side job.  He is the coolest person ever on paper. On paper. I mean, in person, you know, he's. Yeah, I think Nikola Tesla is probably the most important inventor of all time, but. Nikola Tesla, I don't think you would think he's cool, you know, he was just a genius and he was like was in love with a pigeon, like was really crazy guy, really crazy, the really crazy guy, but brilliant but had ideas.  Ellen is like, cool, you can hang out with him. It's super cool. Yeah, he was here smoking one of these.  He got in trouble for about 24 hours and they made Oliner. They bounce back.  They had six for the stock, lost six, lost six percent. Is that right? Yeah, but it came back nine percent the next day. Yeah. And I'm like, yeah, people are crazy, you know, he's the greatest CEO.  He's always in the news. But the fact that the Tesla thing is like his sidekick is what's most ridiculous. He is the coolest person ever in the history. Also very important. He's doing very important things.  Fuck you. I mean, we would be so far behind if it wasn't for one guy. What were the electric car market look like today? If it wasn't for one right.  And they tried to kill? I mean, you just. Yes, he still happens. You get the worst news. Every car crash, Tesla crash on the news. And when there was fires, which there are anymore, and there was only like a few, everyone was front page and people thought those cars blow up, you know.  Yeah. It's like how many gasoline car fires there were that year. We thought, too.  Anyway, I just get the fact that they made such an email, such an amazing car and got past all the bullshit that was coming at him to destroy it. He just doesn't listen.  He's he's like, I'm smarter than you.  So he just keeps going, most of it because of it. He knows what he's doing and he's been right so far. We're fucking lucky that guy's around now. And I don't people don't like people give him shit.  I mean, they should be promoting and hiding the fires and the guy ahead of the the board that looks into crashes like looking at it. What's the name of that board anyway?  You would think you'd go, oh, I've got this car that's fifteen times safer than all my other cars. Let's help this company out. But every day they investigate five hundred crashes a year.  This department, every Tesla crash, they investigate.  You know, he's just on it.  And I understand you have to, in a way, with the self-driving car on top of that. But yeah, but they've not been reckless about that.  And well, there's some there's some accidents, though, that are very troubling. One of them was a guy slams right into the side of a truck. I saw that. Yeah. That one didn't make any sense. That one was like, how does it not know there's a truck in the road but or does it not know what to do when a truck is in the road? Like what happens? Like a truck tips over. What do we do.  Yeah, you don't know what to do while you driving. Right.  Like, that's crazy. Yeah. It's not ready for you to drive yet if it doesn't do it. But you are supposed to pay attention. It isn't, it isn't self-driving yet.  I think people text in fucking. Oh shit.  I've proposed this not good long drive.  I went to Phoenix so bad I had a seven hour drive and I was like but I pulled over. But I that car it's easy to say, oh well it's, it's just a different kind of thing.  It's like you think of what a car is, you think of, you know, an engine and it's pumps gas and you driving around in it. It's that thing is like an electronic vehicle, like it's not a car.  Does it make any noise? It's amazing. It looks just like a car. But where is your engine? It's like, where's the rumble? Where's the where's that stinky gas. Right. Doesn't have any of those things. That's silent.  That's what I noticed. When you look back at horses and I'm like, how do people stand the stink of shit in New York City?  But then when you get an electric car, you go, oh, those other ones, that was poison. I would just get used to it. And I was like, oh, that's what they had.  Yeah. When people just rode horses, it must have smelled terrible everywhere. Just horse shit everywhere.  It'd be like, yeah, I mean really. Right. It should all over the place if everybody was on a horse.  Yeah.  But they got to get, we got to get the new technology because I'm trying to save coal jobs. I get it.  And it's a really tough thing. But we got to better of training. I mean it's like them trying to save the horse. You guys business like we're not going that way.  Do you know the whole learn to code fiasco online? Well, someone was talking about coal miners and like what what they could do, you know, if they stopped mining coal and someone had said, learn to code. Yeah. And then learn to code somehow.  And I probably fucking this up, but became like a bad thing that you couldn't say on Twitter, like an insulting thing that would get you banned from Twitter.  Why? Because learned to code was some sort of an insult, became some sort of an insult or mocking this idea that these people.  So you you can't I mean, it seems like the most innocuous of sentences learn to code. Is there anything wrong with learning? No. Is there anything wrong with learning code? No, there's not. So how come I can't say learn to code? I can't say it because at one point in time it was used to describe this one thing. Now it can be kind of become funny. Learn to code. Yeah. I don't.  Yeah. I don't understand why that's about. It seems like good advice.  It seems like good advice always. But I mean maybe it's mean to say to these coal miners they should learn to code. I got that. But you could also use that and a lot of different ways. Once someone said learn to code, it sounds good. It's not limited. That one meaning, right? You could say it as a friend, like as a joke, like learn to code and you're not you're not being an asshole like your friend is.  Like, my fucking job is so annoying and you're like, learn to code. Yeah. You get kicked off Twitter.  Yeah. They took the whole phrase by one person saying it right.  Now, that phrase is locked up. I mean, it's an unusual phrase.  And I know I used a lot to learn to code. Why can't you say it? I don't know.  But I like Teslas. There's just too many brakes being put on what people can and can't say. Like, I don't know how much of this is legit because I know that Google what is exactly the reason why the Federalists and there was another thing that was explained how that that worked, Jamie, how they were pulled down.  They had an issue with their absence. So that's what Google controls, is that sense, you know. Right. The money that you make off of your website.  So there was an issue with it says Zero Hedge and federalists both had comment pages, I guess, that had AdCenter on it and there was threats of having it taken away from them.  And this article says that the federal spends money to big tech and deletes its awful comment section.  So I was trying to read through it to see goes back to what we were talking about earlier. It's the worst way to talk to people just through text comments. Yes, it's a perfect example. Comment section on a website or an example of why typing something on print is the absolute worst way to communicate with people. Yeah.  How many times do you think that you could have had, like, a disagreement with someone through text messages, but in person you could have, like, come to an agreement pretty easily.  All the time I've run into that problem. I now know not to text if it's anything that could be technical recall.  Yeah, face time's even better just to see their face face times good.  A lot of the kids are doing the face time these days. They just, they just FaceTime you out of the blue. Like that's what a lot of people do now.  Like OK, we're very aggressive in some of these times.  Maybe it is, but some guys like it. Yeah, great, now with this covid, I'm getting way more used to it because of all the zooming I'm doing. That's the worry, though. The worry is, is this separates people even more from the emotional contact that we get, the emotional interaction we get from an actual human being. We get more and more douchy.  What is what what do you get extra? Because I don't know the answer to this. I'm zooming with you. I'm here now with you.  What am I getting extra besides the whiskey and being in person with the. It's a different feeling. Like I know you're right there. Yeah. Yeah. You know, high five.  Yeah, we're right there. That's that's different. I don't think you can get code from contact anymore. Contacting services.  I don't. I just spit in your face.  I lost my caring about any of this covid I in the beginning really did care and I was really scared and I bought into it and then I just hit a thing where you called it care fatigue.  Care fatigue. I got. Is there a word for that? There should just I think what you just invented it to be cool if I. Yeah, it's caring. I think it's care fatigue. Is that a thing? It's probably look, we found the female lumberjack was already a thing. This is probably a good thing, too. I don't know how to take care of. She's an art teacher. Compassion fatigue.  And there's a compassion fatigue awareness that's different. That's different. I think different.  But compassion fatigue makes sense, too, because most people, you know, they don't have so much to give to other folks.  I love like that. Kristen Bell, people like that in the video.  It's like they really are putting themselves out there and getting really crushed.  And if I were them I'm after the first text I did that, I got blowback. I would I would be out.  Yeah. Oh. I think that world, the world of actors and actresses, I think it's very difficult for them to gauge how other people view someone who's really famous, who does something like that. Like you have to understand, I don't think they thought about skepticism. I don't think they thought about people looking at it very cynically. I don't think they considered that. No, I think they only thought they probably talked to their friends, like we're going to make a difference and make a difference with their friends.  Like, you're amazing. You're so powerful. And if anyone can make a difference, it's you, girl. You have the platform, boom. Next thing you know, they're making this video and they're calling their friends just like the one with the same thing. You call your friends. We got this. We got this. We're going to cure this. People are fucking dropping like flies and Italy is falling off balconies and shit. Imagine there's no heaven that like all that.  I also feel bad in a way, because if someone your friend asks you do something, it's hard to say no. Sometimes you've got to tell them, this is how I would make fun of you.  Yeah. To realize what you're doing is crazy. I understand that you're not a person behind. It is great.  Yes, they all mean well. They all mean well. And for white people when it comes to stuff like that, look, all white people feel guilty for something. They just do. Yeah. Because black people used to be slaves. So just that just that alone. If you did not come from that, there's some sort of guilt that you're connected to the ancestors that enslaved those people. There's some in the back of your head. Yeah.  Especially if you're from old family. Like if your family's been in this country for fuckin since the 1500 to some shit for sure. Your family had something to do with slavery for sure. White guilt is real and it's coming up right now. I mean, there's videos of there's a video guy and he just was joking around a black guy. He goes kneel before me and prays like by and she's like kneeling. And it's yeah.  This is a bunch of those videos. There's videos of these people kissing this black dude's feet.  I don't I don't think this is good for black people, you know? I mean, like like what is this?  It's fine. If it's just kissing feet and kneeling, we're fine.  Is it. I'm not surprised because is it good that this I think it's great that white people are marching with them. And that's seems good.  This is what it is meant. Society and people are we're getting better, but we get better like this. Oh yeah. The pendulum, we get better in waves.  Well, you go this way and it comes back. And right now we're in a crazy period. But ultimately, I think what's going to come out of it is way less racism. We're hitting a new stage of no racism. People are always going to judge people. They're going to judge people on everything. They judge people based on the language you speak. Where are you from, whether you're short or tall or fat or skinny, people just judge people.  They're always going to judge people, but it will become more and more taboo and more and more disgusting to people. If you judge people and race now, it's like a new blip in the consciousness. It's a more disgusting crime to actually judge people and limit who you think they the potential as a human being because they're from Southeast Asia or they're from Mexico or they're from like that.  That's going to become a disgusting trait.  Well, something good can come out of this is something good will come out of this. It's always been a disgusting trait, but it's going to it's going to reach a new level of it.  Yeah. Not tolerate it. You're always going to have some racists. You're always going to have some murderers. He was going to have some bank thieves. They're always going to exist. It's like, how about how do you make it better for everybody?  Do you think that police job is like, yeah, that's the best thing. But this is it's happening right now. People are getting I really believe this. The positive side of me says, I really feel like we're going to come out of this on the other end friendlier to each other. We could do that. It's 100 percent possible. Good. The SOCAN, this can be a good thing. Like the horrors of all this can make us appreciate that things can go sideways.  So the folks who have fortunately survived, we can do better.  We've got to survive that pendulum swing. Yes. The Al Franken. The me too. Al Franken, that was a weird one. Went a little too far on that swing, in my opinion.  Oh, that was a weird one. I mean, he was the worst thing he was accused of is the way he held the woman while he was taking a photo with her. And then there was the girl who was on the the girl who was on the plane with them, though. Leeann Tweeden, right?  Yes.  Let's go with Leeann Tweeden. I'm so high, I can't believe I'm fucked up. I'm going to I'm going to. I'm not high at all.  I have no excuse.  She's got the best. She's got the best case because, you know, what is hers is different, like there's a photo of him, that photo. All right. No hands over her breasts while she's sleeping. OK, come on, man. If that was your girlfriend.  Yeah, no, that is. But that's he is when he was a comic, he did something similar on a comedy tour. Yes. There was a comedy. He did some stuff.  And I'm not I'm not defending, but she's wearing a flak jacket and he's not touching her.  But he's pretending is maybe he thought it was funny. Maybe she didn't. I get it. It's a good look, but it's not it's all good stuff. I mean, he's an evil person. I just got fired. He resigned under pressure.  But, yeah, I just I think he's just a smart guy and I don't know. Well, that's he got caught up in that wave, you know, and I think that can happen to folks. I think she even was like, I, I didn't want him to resign, I might I should stop talking, saying things he didn't want to resign.  You say Shiva? Yes. You don't want Shiva to resign.  She didn't want him to lose his job over that.  She I think she came out and said, yeah, I don't think she did either. Again, no information yet.  You know, there's way worse people out there. Yes. That's what's fucked up.  When you find like, you know, when you hear about a guy like Harvey Weinstein. Right. And you realize like, wow. Just the sheer numbers of people fucked with. Yeah. You know, like there are really people like that. Cosby, Cosby, one of the greatest comedians ever, even better, a rapist.  I mean, in terms of all time looking at the years.  See, anybody says that there's nothing ever funny about rape. Didn't hear that. Yeah. Because that was funny. And you're not trying to be mean.  No. I probably will get in trouble though. Yeah, you probably will. Yeah.  But it was funny and most people are reasonable and they're going to understand what we're doing here.  I can't get canceled, but that's not true. You can get canceled if you get like a job on a yes show, then they come back to come to our read said great uncle. And that's exactly right to say I'm sorry. And the goalposts keep getting moved like things that you could say, like readily. One of the things I've been doing is I've been watching a lot of Adam Sandler movies.  Yeah. Oh, oh my God. And some of them are so funny. Like Xoan is one of the funniest fucking movies ever, but like wildly inappropriate. And just just even then, like the things that you can get away with saying then you can't do now. No. You know, I like Rob Schneider and Adam Sandler's movies. He would play a bunch of different races, all kinds that he played, Asian guys he played he played all kinds of weird dudes.  You barely can do that today, I think, ever again.  Will it swing back review? Yeah, you can do other blackface is fine, but I will never be never be fine.  But he apparently was it was not I mean, eighties, that's what it was like. Not not that big a deal. You didn't think like, oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.  Well obviously black people say that's an example or evidence of white people being insensitive right now. You don't realize how offensive it is to put on paint, to pretend to be like us.  I didn't know. I had no idea. Black people when they saw like someone dressed up as Bill Cosby, like a white guy we're mad about, I really didn't know. Right.  Well, what's confusing is if you don't have a good sense of history. Yeah. You think of it and you go, well, if I saw a black guy dressed like a white guy, like, what would I give a fuck? Yeah, but you have to go to, like, those Al Jolson movies.  That Black Face was weird, different.  I feel like, dude, it was cartoonish and strange. And black people couldn't act in movies, so they had white people. Right. Dress up and put paint on their face so that they look real black person. To me, it's like I understand that people think that's offensive. I understand that it's offensive to you. I get it. But when I watch that, to me it is fucking fascinating. Fascinating. Like almost in a scientific sense, like you're looking at a different version of human beings, right?  You look at these people that are just really interesting people dancing and running around and doing so with this weird hate on their face.  That's him humanizing. So weird man. So weird.  And it was like they praised him. You went backstage a great job. Yeah.  Man, let me hear some of this shit. Can I hear some of it? MELLENCAMP No, nothing. We got trouble. I'll tell you what.  It should be in public domain, but it's not so OK. Sorry.  Well, when my screen goes out to you, when you look at him like it's so strange looking, give me a little. Imagine what he's like, I, I like the way black people look, but their music's too good.  So what I'm going to do is to let go of a white guy version.  It is. And just pretend I'm a black guy and I'm going to do like black white music because, I mean, how many like how many blues singers were alive back then that just had, you know that.  What year was this?  1927, I believe.  What how what year was Robert Johnson alive? Find out. Robert Johnson. That's the legendary blues man that the big legend of whether or not he sold his soul to the devil because he was so much better than everybody else same time. So here you go, folks.  This is how black white people are.  Jesus, that Al Jolson is pretending to be a black guy while Robert Johnson is alive and making music. And Robert Johnson like that's the Roots. I think it's Route 66 story. Let's not forget, there's supposedly where he met the devil on the highway. Oh, that game.  And he sold his soul to the devil to be the greatest blues man ever. Well, it's hard for us to to see in the 20/20 context when there's so much music.  Man is so much brilliant music. There's The Beatles and fuckin Sturgill Simpson and Kiss and Rolling Stones. There's so much fucking music that you could just get on your phone at any time. But back then, this one dude, Robert Johnson, was so intoxicating that people thought that he had sold his soul to get that good.  That was that's a real legend, man, people. That's about it. And he was just traveling around singing the blues. And you can listen to it today, but it's hard to put it into perspective.  Is his stuff public domain def that's the thing is like I'll pay for it because you give us a little give us a little taste. But Robert Johnson, it's, it's hard. It's like when you listen to Lenny Bruce comedy, it's hard for it to translate to today because the times are just so different. Yeah. And this is the same thing with Robert Johnson. But you got to think in his day that just recorded music was like 20 years old.  Yeah. Yeah. You know, like nobody even knew their recording, like Beethoven and shit on these big stupid discs. Yeah. When this is this is a guy that was way ahead of the curve. I want to hear this now.  Come on, Jamie. What could it be, 40 grand. I mean, it's not a big deal.  Just give me a touch of Robert Johnson. How much can you cross? Are you going to pay for it?  Phone. Robert Johnson. I'm running out of money, and I would imagine listening to this in a bar with sawdust on the ground and he's on the stage.  What year? That a whiskey. Nineteen. Was it thirty? It said he died in thirty eight feet at twenty seven.  So he wasn't even that old. He died at twenty seven. All died twenty seven. So imagine this. And then this wack ass Al Jolson singing terrible songs and pretending to be a black guy at the exact same time that Robert Johnson was alive.  Must have felt real good. Well, and then you got to think that Robert Johnson, you're talking about a guy who was alive.  Fifty six like sixty years after slavery ended, right? Yeah. Yeah.  He was born and he. What does it say, how he died? Eleven, he was born in 1911. That's crazy. So for that fifty six years, 50 years, that's when he's born after slavery ended, right. So it's basically the divide between people that used to be slaves and regular folks is still so fucked up, man.  Yeah.  One thing I was reading about that I didn't know about was I reading or somebody told me this, that for the longest time after slavery, one of the big things was they would just arrest black men for anything, for loitering, and then they would make them work for like pennies a day. I did make them fucking break rocks and shit. So they give given these crazy sentences. So they basically kept them slaves.  They just arrested them a lot for shit. Yeah. And then imagine being a guy whose entire life you've been a slave. Now you're 25 years old and they just let you free and you got to figure out how to get a job. And nobody wants to hire you and everybody scared you and everybody's prejudice against you. And yeah, there's no opportunities. And then you just start arresting you and making break rocks, you know, like, fuck.  Yeah, I thought you guys are going to fix this. Like, this isn't any better. This is worse. So a whole generation had to go through that. Yeah. Before it still got to the civil rights movement in the 60s. It's really crazy. Yeah. It's not that long.  Not that long man. I am I am 52 years old and I believe Michael Yo had on his page that.  A year like to the very year that I was born, maybe I was alive for one year where it was illegal for a black man and a white woman to get married illegal till like the late 60s.  Yeah. I didn't know that. Did you know that? No, I don't know anything, dude, that's my lifetime.  Yeah, I think I think I was a year old when they made it legal. Well, can you find out if that's accurate? Jamie, what do you eat, it looks delicious. Come on, Jamie, show what you got there. Oh, the neuro gum. What does that do that makes you smarter?  I need one so bad to me. You do, too. I do as well.  I know. I'll smoke a joint and drink. Yeah. And then try to make. Good point.  We're making great points. Here we go. 1967. So when the year I was born. Interracial marriage in United States has been fully legal in all U.S. states since 1967. There you go.  So it's like that's not that long ago, man. That's not that long ago. Interesting history. Yeah. And we're still we're still getting over it.  Yeah, it's American Indians. Don't even start with that.  I'm obsessed. You see you see that giant painting that I had out there that Graig over 10 painting row, that big white Indian face when you walk. Yes. Yes.  I got obsessed with Native American history obsessed.  I don't know much about it. Can you enlighten me a little bit? First, there's a book you got to start with.  This is the one that'll get you. It's called Empire of the Summer Moon by this guy Cygwin. It's fuckin crazy. It's all about the Comanches and all about how the Mexicans tricked people in the saddle and into Texas because they knew the Comanches lived there and the Comanches were going to kill them. They wanted a buffer between people, the Comanches. So they gave them all this land. Like, Senor, this is a place for you since these poor bastards out to be slaughtered.  Wow. Oh, my God, dude, it's the best book, I think, in terms of like like a perception shifting book, the best book I've ever read. I actually listen to it on tape.  I have to say, I never thought I was going to read. I don't read anything.  I read mostly magazines. I really I just mostly listen to books on tape. But this one is so well-written, is so fascinating. And the the people that figured out how to conquer the Comanches. Yeah. Basically with the guys that figured out how to use pistols, they had to change their change the way they did battle and they had a go against them on horseback. Comanches were so good at fighting on horseback. Yeah. And these dumb Americans, the, you know, early Americans, why aren't you in a line?  They would get off the bus. They have to shoot their long rifle off their horse, could have to dismount from their horse, pull out their musket, Boomhauer, and they got to repack. It takes a minute to repack it. And these Indians were just fucking them up so they couldn't get past a certain point in the United States. And that was Texas. That's why Texas is so fucking fierce today, because the Texas Rangers were the first people that figured out how to fuck up the Comanches.  They lived like Comanches. They made cold camps. They didn't light fires. They just bullshit. They survive. They dressed like like you like regular people. They wore whatever the fuck they wanted and they figured out how to fight on horseback. And then they figured out how to use a Colt revolver. And it was the they were the only people using the revolver. Nobody nobody saw use for something they could fire five times before it ran out of bullets.  So this guy invented this revolver when he was like, I think he was like six years old or something crazy. Yeah. And the patent kind of floated around for a while. And he made them, but nobody really wanted them. But then these Rangers kept finding these Comanches. They only had two muskets in their hand and one long once they had three shots and they had to get the fuck out of there. Yeah, we can't beat these guys.  They have like twenty arrows. This is fucked up. And so this one guy got a hold of a Colt revolver and then he goes, hey, I think we just changed the game. They started fucking up these Indians on horseback. Yeah. And they started conquering big chunks of land that they couldn't, you know, the Comanches were dominating before.  It's crazy story, man.  That's the best one to start with because they were so ruthless to each other.  I will listen to it. I read I read Suslow. I get panic attacks and as a with subtitles in the movie, I was in school. My parents kept trying to make me read faster. This was back before they saw I've got a reading problem. You just were dumb.  You were an idiot, right? Period. And so they took me to this nun. There were these nuns that had this reading machine that we heard about.  So yeah. So we drive an hour and a half to go to this reading machine.  What did you think it was before you got there? What was the magic? I didn't know what I was going to say, but it was like, how old are you at the time?  Fourteen. Maybe you to a reading machine. Yeah. And so it's a nun. Very sweet. And it projects on the wall like one sentence at a time and it goes by a certain speed is like one through ten speeds. And so she tells me where I am the first day and I'm level one. I can only read the absolute slowest. And she saw I was upset and she goes, don't worry. By the end of the summer you'll be on the level ten.  And I was like, Really?  So I worked all summer and at the summer test, guess what level I was on.  I worked really hard. Yes, I was on one. And the her faith in God dropped off her face.  I could read and I still get angry when I read and I can't get this day I read like this. I had to go back and then I go this way.  I guess words like I know how long believe is sometimes it's a different.  Anyway, the problem is nobody recognized that you were actually a comedian that was trying to be a regular person.  Yeah, that's what a normal person. That was the problem. Like, what is he going to do?  I wish I was there. Well, my my I actually was very upset when I was like twelve years old. I was voted class clown, but I wanted to be at that age. You want to be cool and liked by girls, you know.  Yeah. The only four showdown clown to me was was bad, I realized that's how they saw me. I was like tiny. They changed it to my best personality because they heard that I was upset about it.  And then my mother proceeded to fill my room with clowns.  Oh, my God, my room was filled. And I was I didn't really have a voice back then. I didn't really want it for whatever reason. I just let my mother fill my room with clowns.  There was one painting of a clown reading The Wall Street Journal, and he was crying like he had clown headstock, like some clown had like stock.  Oh, my God. Very upset about what was happening in the stock market.  I was so high I could remember Leeann Tweeden name, but I was I was thinking was was it Lewine?  But I know her. She's nice. She's a nice person.  The account of Robert Johnson's death is pretty crazy. Let's hear it. I just lost it because I was looking at the devil legend, too, which is pretty interesting, but. He he went down, so he does recording's he did we're almost near the end of his life because there wasn't obviously lots of recording back back then.  He had it says he traveled to a plantation to perform at a dance party and he was poisoned by someone who he was having an affair with the guy's wife.  Oh, my.  The guy didn't know he had an ulcer, so he said he wasn't trying to kill. He was trying to make him sick. The ulcer made him really sick.  He bled. Oh. Then the back of his death certificate. I'll let you read this part because it's pretty like adds to it a little bit since it was written on the back of it.  This part right here where part of this paragraph in the middle, I can't see that.  Well, it says, I talked with the white man who plays this Negro died. And I also talked with the Negro woman on the place. The plantation owner said the Negro man, seemingly about twenty six years old, came from Tunica two or three weeks before he died to play the banjo at a Negro dance given there on the plantation and say Negro. He stayed in the house with some of the Negroes, thinks he wanted to pick cotton. The white man did not have a doctor for this Negro and he did not.  Or he had worked excuse me, as he had not worked for him. He was buried in a homemade coffin furnished by the county. The plantation owner said that was his option or that was his opinion, that he died of syphilis. His sister then came, got him out of that coffin, tried to have his death looked into, and no one really looked into it. And that's about the end of that. And so somebody might have poisoned him.  This wasn't found out until thirty years later.  They thought he just disappeared. What? Yeah, what death wasn't reported publicly.  He disappeared from the historical record and wasn't until, like thirty years later, some people found his music and they found that dug into his life on his death certificate, found out all this information way after the fact.  Wow.  So like this guy who everyone reveres is like one of the best musicians of all time. Wow, no formal autopsy was done. Hmm, the same time that's happening, all that real shit, Al Jolson's got white gloves on me making all the switches. Is it doing movies and people clapping?  Yeah. So talented.  Do you imagine what white guilt was like back then? It must have been suffocating. I don't think there was any none of the ones who are aware were like, oh my God, my race sucks.  Were they. What did we do. That's an interesting thing.  For the record, that was on Wikipedia that could have been organized and maybe the not most truthful way, but. Right.  That's how it was put in place right now.  I didn't know any of that man. That's interesting. I didn't know he was that young, too. Yeah, but it's kind of funny, men like that.  It's just weird that just a few years ago, Jimmy Kimmel, did he do like Karl Malone? Did he do it? Yeah, that is that was OK. Interesting.  How what do you do about going back and canceling? Well, it's hard because, like, the context of the time is different. When Jimmy Fallon was playing Chris Rock, I know you think it's offensive, but it wasn't universally considered offensive to pretend to be someone of a different race. It wasn't like automatically thought of as you're trying to be racist if you pretend you're doing you're pretending you're Chris Rock. If you can do a Chris Rock impression and you put makeup on your face, that makes you were going to African-American.  It wasn't it wasn't necessarily racist because you were pretending to be an actual human being. Right. Used to be different. Like we thought of it differently. Now it's a universally thought across the board. If you're a white person, you can't put black makeup on. Everyone's agreed to that elevated standard and we all agree to it right now. If you did it now, that would be right if you did. Now it's different if you decided now you're like, fuck your rules, man.  I'm fucking crazy. Yeah. You know, that's that's really what's going on. And back then, it wasn't a problem. People thought it was funny, like, oh, my God, that's Jimmy Fallon pretending to be Chris Rock. Oh, yeah, you could do it. You could pretend to be Mr. T.. When I was in high school, like when I was in high school, you could put makeup on your face, have gold chains around your neck, and you could pretend.  Did you ever do face the 80s?  I had to tonight. Either I got lucky. Yeah, but you're right.  Like it wasn't thought of as you didn't think. Oh, I'm doing something bad.  No, you didn't. I don't think they thought that. And that's like where does that where does that end? Hmm. Like what what can booking you not pretend to be like as long as you like isn't intent. What's really important?  I totally I absolutely think it is important.  I mean, I, I think intent is what's important should be when things become taboo and superpowered, they become very dangerous.  It's just weird because then people are so scared of saying it that they want to say it more and then the race is more powerful weapon to.  Yeah, it's and we don't have to let go new ones. You know, we've already lost certain words that we can never say again, even in jest, because they're so offensive to them. Even uttering them is like an incantation for an ass kicking. Yeah. You're going to call people to beat your ass. Yeah. Right. I mean that's really what it's good to have that option.  But the real problem is intent. Intent is like words are supposed to just be noises you make that let other people know what you're thinking. It's all it's supposed to be. And when a word becomes like a super powerful word or a deed becomes a super powerful deed, like a thing like that doesn't really hurt anybody like blackface like that. When you decide if you decided to be Mike Tyson for Halloween and you're an Italian guy and you know, and you have to fucking fake tattoo put on my fucking face, so fucking you know, like, well, champ, people would only think it's funny, you know, if that's your intent, especially if you're an actual Mike Tyson fan.  It's just weird that it's and it's because of their origins is because Al Jolson, Al Jolson and his shitty movies, the guys in movies, I mean, how many blackface people were there back then?  Was it that big of a deal? It was. I know there's an album cover with Judy Garland in blackface. He was in blackface. No, on an album cover.  Oh, my God. See, but like, if there was none of that.  If it was just right, right, if it never existed, if just black people did their music and and they were just recognized as being musicians and there was never like a white guy would try to pretend he's black and do it and steal their thunder, if that never existed at all. You think it wouldn't be a problem? I don't think it would be a problem.  I'm not sure it's for the record, didn't start with Al Jolson. That was just the first time it was captured on film. So that's the only thing we have to look at. Oh, so how long had it been going on? Since 1830.  Oh, my God. So, dude, while slavery was still legal, white people were pretending to be black people on stage and singing shitty songs.  It's just like they're not even trying to look like black people, though, which is where they came up with a caricature cartoon.  Yeah, look at that. Oh, my God. W m h W's big minstrel jubilee. Now, me as a person, just as a human being, I understand the context of what would be offensive about this. And we're where we are today in 2020 and the progress we're making and all that stuff. I just got to tell you, for me as a person that is fascinating, I am fascinated by this as just the evolution of a of an animal, of a human being, of a culture where we're seeing the people from that day.  What years is like?  That picture was from nineteen hundred I think. OK, so nineteen hundred. So one hundred and twenty years ago, the evolution of that version of a human being to our version of a human being. Yeah. Look, we're very different from people that lived 120 years ago and this is a great example of how different we are. When you see stuff from that time, it's like I understand how it's offensive to people. I get it. I understand it should be offensive.  It should be offensive to people were treated that way. It should be. However, just as someone who is like watching like if you're watching a bird and exhibited really weird behavior a long time ago, then it stopped doing it. He'd be freaked out like, wow, what happened? Why they stopped doing this. Like, how do they how do they evolve? How are they different from the way they were back then?  And if you got to if you could fucking have a time machine and go back and watch a minstrel show, a live minstrel show, you and me, we get high as fuck every time to get a time machine. Could you imagine sitting there watching that crazy nonsense like a white guy with, like, black paint? Always be exaggerated lips and he's got white gloves, man. Hey, man. Hey.  Singing these terrible songs.  Yeah, it it's weird that those those things happen, but it's that would actually be a fascinating Oculus Rift game.  Wait a minute. What. Yeah.  If you could put a game like one of those Oculus Rift things. Yeah. If you could put a helmet on and it would just transport you back in time, not just to this place but like to Egypt. How about that. How about you're in ancient Egypt in like 2000 B.C. with Cleopatra. Yeah, actually she lived in like the ads, ten thousand eighty. She lives in the ads. Cleopatra, I think I'm not a good example.  I went to those festivals. What do you call those?  Those are great. And they're having this big like here show and the guys on stage and there's people, you know, all dressed up watching. And I wanted so bad to go up in my now clothes from backstage. I could have got backstage like everybody.  I'm from the future and they'd have to continue to pretend they're from the olden times and be like in the future. People make fun of you and they do these festivals and they're a bunch of nerds who act like you and they have to continue to go away from the future.  So they couldn't break character anyway. I was too scared to death. Do you think they'll ever have a millennial festival like they have a Renaissance festival? Apocalypso, but everybody's on their phone being a dick.  Well, I'm an activist. Look at all the hashtags I use. You know what, I think some version of that will happen, OK? Having 80, 80 parties now?  Well, that's what I think about what's happening with us. And this is this is a good way to look at it. We're talking about these ripples and waves and ups and downs, and we're experiencing a big, crazy shift.  All that, though, I think. On the other end comes out better, I think it comes out better for everybody. I really do. I think all this horrible shit is happening to us right now as a culture needs happen so we can be nicer to each other.  It's totally. But that would be great. It's totally possible. It can 100 percent be the outcome. And I think it is going to be the outcome, because if you look at all these people that are peacefully marching versus the people that are looting and all the crazy shit, yeah. That the numbers are overwhelming. Most people are peacefully marching.  I want people to my brother's a cop, so I have like, you know, I really feel defensive of him because he's just such a good cop and a good guy. And I just feel like the news is just making things.  They're going a little overboard with. Bro, they canceled paw patrol. Do you understand this? That's how he's being police. That's how seriously. Well, one of them is also a fire person. They have different jobs.  They canceled Paul Patrol because of the cop part. That's for the canceled because they canceled the show cops the most reality.  Right. All reality shows.  That's a good way to show you what cops are most cops are doing.  I mean, and most criminals we've got to know about look the like we really the best confirmation that we ever got about Florida man came from cops. Yeah. That account, like all those accounts, the Twitter accounts and Instagram accounts that show all the crazy shit the Florida guys do. Yeah, all that. Most of it came from that.  Yeah. Yeah. I want to it's also hard to even sort of bring interest in the conversation cops and what they're dealing with because.  Yes, because it's like you're you're not on the right side like I, I am for, you know, Black Lives Matter.  But but I also just want to introduce there's so much coming at cops right now. I mean, they go up to these cars terrified, like you go through a haunted house. You know, a lot of it is is bad.  They're not giving up training. They're not you know, they're really scared and they have a gun.  And so when you start wrestling with someone who's got a gun, suddenly who knows who has the gun, it is from that point on, it's a and they don't have a whole lot of physical requirements on how much they learn martial arts or gun retention or any of that stuff. I don't know.  And also now you can't, you know, to control the head, to control the body. Yeah.  And now you can't control blood anymore. And look.  And the guy who died, Eric Garner Garner. That's the one in New York. Yeah.  He actually he didn't die from the chokehold. I think a lot of people think he did. They were sitting they were like leaning on him. He couldn't breathe. Yeah.  But he was also being choked. But no, but not while none of that was. Listen, that thing around the arm.  Around the head. Yeah. No one stays there. They'll stay there. You have to hold them. You have to squeeze them when you squeeze in mitrokhin them. If I hold you like that, I'm not I'm not putting you to sleep, but I'm slowly choking it. Yeah.  If a guy has a guy the way that cop had Eric Garner down, I, if I basically remember correctly he was using like a Gabal grip and as it wasn't a full runic choke was choking him to sleep, but he was holding this across the neck.  And I would say anybody who doesn't think that that's a choke, let me put it on you. Let me put it on you. Lie on the ground and I'll grab your neck like that. I'm telling you, it's a choke.  I could be wrong. But if I remember the video that he did the choke and once he got on the ground, he let the he the guy actually didn't die from. Do we have that video?  I think that one you're correct. I think Eric Garner died from a heart attack, but they were like they were leaning or sitting on it.  But but it was also crazy because it was for loose cigarettes. But my point is, like, if someone is holding your head like that, it's it's a choke. It just is you know, it might not it's not a full choke where you're going to sleep. But if someone has you in a position where they're on top of you, you're on your stomach, OK, so all their weight is on you, which makes it very hard to breathe already.  The other guy's rubbing his arm.  No, I'm saying he's on the ground.  The seat is left arm in. That one is not totally under the neck. So that one is. See how that is? That is that is a choke. Look at look at his hands. See his hands are grouped together. Let me show you what I'm doing here. Look at this. See this. Yeah. This is one hundred percent of choke. One hundred percent.  There's if no ifs, ands or buts about it, that's a fucking choke. And anybody who doesn't think that, let me put it on you. That's a choke that's under the neck. That's worse than I thought it was. That is a 100 percent choke. I could be wrong.  But if you go forward in the video, I don't think the choke that he's doing on him and I understand what you say now.  It's very long. But if but here's the thing.  He shouldn't have done it at all, man. That's the thing. If that is what caused him to die and we don't know if that was or if it was the people on top of him or was the stress the event or it was a combination of all those things. But that had to play a factor that choking that dude. And why over loose cigarettes? That's the most important. That story. Look, I'm not crazy. I'm not in defense of this situation.  I was just making the point that, like, sometimes when if you take away from a cop the ability to I mean, it all know they're not even going to if someone if you had a gun and someone is going after you, you have to assume they might kill you.  You do anything you can in that situation. And that situation is not a good example. I was just making the point that he actually didn't die from that, that he died from them. They were like leaning on him and sitting on him.  But we don't know that, though. Here's the thing, man. The way he's on that guy's neck, that guy's big. Look at the guy who was doing that. Go back to that. The guy who was doing that choke has some big ass fucking arms, dude. He's got some big fucking straw. Look at that guy's arm. That's a strong motherfucker, man. All those muscles around where his elbows stuck, I'll choke the shit out of you.  Look at his shoulders, his triceps. I am telling you, if that guy is trained in something and it seems like is a guarantee, he's strong as fuck. That is a rough thing to go through, my friend.  I'm telling you so I don't deny I can't say if you're seeing that. You're definitely seeing that you're looking right at it. You can't say that's not what killed them, because if that guy is holding on, we don't know how long.  I don't know how long you think he's alive after this. Maybe he had a heart attack because of that. That's possible because this dude is on him like a pit bull. And for what, Lou?  Cigarettes. It's fucking crazy. It's the craziest story.  I want to make it clear I'm not pro this story. My point is that I know you're not. Yeah, this.  But we forget what things really looked like. I do it all the time. I need to look at it again. I didn't know it was like that.  Yeah, I have. I just like I just know if you're in a situation where. What's up Jamie.  The perpetual thing I was going to say, does it bring it back? It's a troll. All those motherfuckers got me. No, what happened? They got me.  PaPeRo was a troll. Well, they weren't really.  Can't patrol. They got me. You got me fucks. But here's the thing, man. The cops was cops, real cop. But in my eyes, there's something about cops that was always mocking these poor fucks that are getting arrested. Even the theme song Bad Boys, Bad Boys, what you're going to do, what you're going to do when they come for you.  They made it funny. They made it funny to watch these cops pull over these bumbling rednecks with those fucking red plastic cops. They're beating each other up. Yeah. Great show. It was a crazy show.  31 years is probably the longest running show next to The Simpsons, right?  Yeah. This is not a troll, though.  This is our breaking news as California governor orders all citizens to wear face masks, why aren't all public places and stuff so well?  How did we go backwards? I don't know. I'll tell you how. Protests, no one saying yes. Don't spread it.  Don't worry. Whatever you do, don't try to get your job back. Piece of shit. Are you guys demonstrating you're killing grandma but protest, it's like. Yeah, so we're making a difference. Yeah, yeah.  There's also like cops where these heroes, you know, the parades, front line workers and a week later, like, you're an asshole.  You know what? All it takes is one or two bad cops and there's two in a row. Now, the guy in Atlanta, Jamie, was telling me the story that the guy knew that the Taser that the the gentleman stole from him and ran away from, like, pointing a Taser at him when they shot him. He knew the Taser didn't work out, really knew it had already been fired. Apparently there's video which had not I didn't see it.  I've only seen photos after they shot them. They didn't do anything for like two minutes. Or some one of them tried to help the other ones, like they stood on them or someone kicked them. I heard they kicked them. I heard someone kicked. Yeah, dude, it's the best example for why we should have something other than the cops for drunk people, like someone who's like a nice guy, who's a counselor comes in and talks to you.  Is it only one guy?  Yeah, I fell asleep in his car at the drive thru. OK, we're going to send Mike and Mike is going to be like, hey, man, you all right? You're actually Mike's probably cops.  Maybe not.  Maybe Mike says, Listen, man, let me give you a ride home. We're going to park your car right here. We're all good. That's. Give me your keys. Come back in the morning when you're sober. Here's my number. Call me. I'll grab you. I'll pick you up.  I'll bring you to the car. Also, homeless, maybe take that away from cops. So homeless dealing with homeless.  Yeah, that's. You're right. You're right. Right. That's a real different sort of crime. That's like a systemic poverty crime thing.  Like there's something weird going on if that many people are are homeless, like what kind of how fucked up is the balance of your your little community when seventy thousand people are homeless.  Yeah. Like L.A. has Boulder, but homeless inside of it really close. Boulder's like one hundred thousand people.  L.A. has got more than 70000 and growing homeless people. So the entire population of Boulder, no house shove them into L.A. and they're that tents under the you know, the freeways and stuff.  They make little tent cities.  I don't want those people to have to live like that, but I don't want them to live there either. You know, it's a two prong thing. It's like, how do you fix that? I don't know how you fix it once it gets started. You know, it's very difficult to give someone back their dignity and, you know, and to do it, you almost need one on one individual attention with someone who is like a counselor, a babysitter.  Someone's going to straighten the person out and clean them up and get them to think better and get them to eat better and get them to drink water and stop shooting heroin into the dick and get a job.  And this should never shown the addict. That's what happened to Harvey Weinstein. That's why we got a mushroom penis.  Well, things must be I unfortunately Googled that disease. And you don't want to you don't want to do it. I only want to say what it's called, but it's a type of gangrene that diabetic men get.  If they get an infection in their care, their care, when they get an infection, they get this horrible gangrene. And there are some fucking images on. There's some things that Google will censor.  OK, but not but not green dicks. Rydex, that's open top of the search. What about see called was the the the type of gangrened call.  You should everyone should know about it, but no one should go look it up.  I looked it up. Don't listen to me. Do whatever you want to do. You just need to know it's a real thing. And that then someone texted me may might have been Metzker. Someone texted me that they heard it was because Harvey was shooting Coke into his dick. Yeah that's what I heard.  So it's probably Metzker and he probably needs to do a circle of life. Fournier's or Fournier's. It's a it's a last name. I think it's, it's capitalized.  So Fournier's gangrene and it's gangrene of the dick and you have been warned and it didn't slow him down, which is your fault.  Absolutely. I kept one of my phone because I just I was so confused.  You need to be pretty close, get something injected by his assistants to to get his heart up. Yeah, I'm just surprised that that didn't slow him down from his sexual assaults.  College boy. No, I don't know. I'm not even a pfennigs. I know what I'm looking at. Meatballs and sausage. That's, you know, what's that tongue thing coming exactly?  Oh, no, that's a fully rotten asshole. Like that guy rotted out from the top of his dick to his asshole.  God, yeah, I, I had a STD scare.  I don't have a nasty day, but this is what happened. I woke up and the area right above my most precious area was a little puffy.  Right. So I called the doctor and lady goes, what do you want to see the doctor for. I don't know what to say, but I was this what came out of me. I go, I have a puffy pubic area and she goes like a receptionist at a doctor's office.  Their job is to make you feel like, oh, that's fine pubic area.  We get this all done. That's so funny. I picked up her probably pubic area. Come on in.  So I'm like, oh, this is something she's never heard of now meeting. Well, so I go in there and it's a little waiting room and I go up to the desk and I will.  Kyle Dunnigan hoping she'll see the chart and go, OK, sit down, I got you. And she goes, what are you here to see the doctor for again?  And I'm like, and I go, I have a puppy, I have a puppy pubic area.  And she goes, Oh, you talk to her? Yeah. We're talking like they were laughing and talking about it.  So I talk to her. We know that story.  Yeah. We were laughing all morning about that story, your puffy pubic area and everybody is hot, which, you know, whereas in this nurse came out and she's like.  And then she's walking me down the hallway and she goes, what are you here to see the doctor for? Does anybody fucking communicate?  This sounds like a great to all the girls are hot.  You got a puffy pubic area and she just tell you this is going to sound crazy, but it's because to get the last, you know, acquirement, I'm trying to not come.  I mean, yes. Challenge for 30 days. I want to respect. My God, that's what it is. You're Cumins backed up. Yeah. So let's get Diane in here. Starts to work its way into your lower gut.  Michelle's got to work your balls. Get out of there.  You have like a leaky cum container, like you're a dispenser. It's like it's just yet too much in there. Well, it's overflowing.  That is a great porno. And I don't want to I don't dismiss that as a great porno.  So the end of this story, the doctor comes in and I mean that PaPeRo really opens up, looks down, looks up at me and he goes, oh, you just got a low fat.  He left the room. I got a little fat. I even notice that's all it is. And I just wasted my day and humiliated myself, that's all. I puffy pubic area.  You were worried you were going to die. Yeah, well, the reaction can stop.  Well, that was the thing about Robert Johnson, too, right? They said that thing. Oh, I think he had syphilis. Yeah. Somebody murdered that guy.  What are the symptoms of. I like to be a hypochondriac.  I wanted to get into this one. We've discussed this one too many times in the past. All right. So, OK, I'm going to do it anyway. Do you know what the term bigwig. You know, I like it. It's good to know what comes from because people who lost their hair had to wear wigs from syphilis and it came from these two French dudes, I think.  What are their cousins or some shit? I forget that's an accent you can still do. But they were. Yeah, you can do that.  You know, there's only one reason no one hated me.  If I had no idea you could do Italian to go away and Mohicans nobody.  I don't think you'll ever not be able to pick on a so what is it, Louis?  The 14th and his cousin.  So they they had syphilis, the fucking hairs falling out. Giant clumps of teeth are falling out of their head. Like when people had syphilis, they just rotted apart. And when their hair was falling out, they just got a crazy wig.  And the more money you had, the bigger the wig you can get. So the real big wigs. So all these other people got syphilis, too. And then wigs became like a thing of fashion. Anyway, I bet back then people just fucked everybody. Everybody just fucked.  Everybody just ran to do well. No, it was rampant. Right. There's all these stories of like hundreds and hundreds of years ago where paedophilia and man, boy love like it was normal. Yeah. Guys had, like, little boyfriends, like famous philosophers had like a little boy. Clotilde.  Yeah. Like just imagine that shift in culture, you know, that was a good thing to get rid of I think for sure.  But the Catholic Church disagrees. Yeah. That's a whole thing.  We could talk about a tax on the powder they used on the hair to like cover up the smell is what stopped. It felt like the fat of the tax on the powder.  So the powder became too expensive. The smelly powder stopped sometime and everybody smelled like perfume. Me stinky pussy like hair was like a foot. And they said perfume all over the floor. Stinky, rotten fucking marathoners foot.  You're you're you're better off being a very poor person.  I don't know.  But I would rather be someone who just got a studio apartment who makes forty whatever then be a king back then you would be a king if you imagine if you could just tell these people, if you like, you were in like ancient Europe and you're like, I'm going to show you how I live.  Oh, God, the shower. He turned it on like, oh my God, now I'm going to watch TV. Oh, look, they're pumping his fucking wig with powder. I was really leaning into it.  So these dudes would all, like, lose not just their hair, but their teeth would fall. They would get holes in their face. And there's all these pictures. Oh, there's Lindsey for terrorists. That's well, that's our clip talking about. Yeah, we can show our own clip. See that image of that dude's head? That guy's head was falling apart like that because of syphilis. He was literally his skin was rotting apart. That's how apparently it's Al Capone died as well.  Oh, really? Yeah.  Wigs became fashionable, right. Because, yes, everyone in a wig, wigs became fashionable. God damn that lady lost her nose. It's so crazy looking. That is so crazy looking.  Oh, just a big hole where your nose used to be.  But people have like holes in their cheeks and shit. Yeah.  Like each year they would die. It's terrible man.  I wish I saw more. You know, those off.  Jamie, shut it off. That's my skull. Yeah. I mean it would rot right through you. It's really spooky stuff. Like got so anybody who doesn't.  Yeah. Anybody just like vaccine. Settle down, settle down.  Yeah, oh, yeah, man, I've had this gentleman, Dr. Peter Hotez, he's a vaccine advocate. He's a doctor, is expert in tropical diseases. He was on the podcast talking about covid and stuff like that. And, you know, he gets very angry and people spout mistruths about vaccines. Like, you have to look at the good and the bad. Like you have to be real honest about what happens with any any kind of medication.  But with vaccines like, my God, we fix so many fucking problems. Your kids don't have to worry about polio anymore. You don't have to worry about smallpox anymore. Smallpox killed everybody. There was so much shit that was just killing people until they figured out vaccines.  It just people who aren't aware of that history or they don't really they're really sick and they're fucking they they're rightfully distrustful of a corrupt government.  That's why. So they hear about vaccines like it's fucking Bill Gates trying to put a microchip in me. What is that idea about Bill Gates?  I mean, to me, I can't figure out he's spent so much of his money. Something happened helping people set me up.  And Bill Gates became a bad guy. He spent so much of his money. Not enough Bill. You fuck. I mean, would you do that? You got 60 billion. You give me 50 billion. I think it's good enough. He gives his kids money. It's good. He's telling he's not telling them that he's giving them at the moment. I heard fifty billion.  I'm going to live like I'm in a Jay-Z video. I'm just going to get a giant yacht and I'm going to have gold underwear. I'm going to have a bottle of Dom Chan with a song Big Pimpin. Dude, you're waiting for fifty billion. Yeah, that's the number.  I think you're good now because you have to have goods, land. You have to have a lot of things planned out. These fucking crooks out there are not playing.  Is that the number. Fifty billion when you can relax.  I don't know what a number is, when you can relax. But at that number I'd say yes, I think. But even then those fucking dudes always feel like they need more.  That's there you are. When all those other dudes there you are got yachts.  Jay-Z got a fucking cruise ship. I forgot that there was someone walking around with the dog, come on, man, this is what I'm talking about, helping me to do it, just dancing all the. But here's the thing, man. The real thing. This is appealing because you can't have it. And the only time that feels good is when you do other shit, that's hard if you're just doing that every day, I swear to God you won't be happy.  Yeah, sounds fucked up, but you got to trust me. Human beings need puzzles. We need to solve things. We need games to win. We need things to do. We need books to write. We need things to accomplish. We need goals that we set. We got to achieve them. If you don't do that, you're not going to be happy. And it's a big problem with people today.  And if every day was like big pimpin, you would get bored big pimpin for the weekends when you bust your ass Monday through Friday and you fucking put the pedal to the metal and then, you know, I mean, you look at rich kids that are disasters is it's really not a terrible event.  I think he'd be really sad just given a huge house. He would be sitting in this big house by yourself. Yeah.  You don't want a huge house, man. Not if you're one dude in particular. If you're Batman, you're living in one giant castle by yourself. This is your Batman. Come on, man. You can't be. You're so much. Yeah. I wonder why you're so moved. Yeah. Yeah. But I think he hangs out with Robin. I think, you know, rabbinical court but he's like, I might have to keep rescuing this fucking guy.  Oh yeah. It does have to sort of care always you're saving. Never pulls his own fucking weight.  This Robin you're the Batman movie with the with Alicia Silverstone. That was maybe the worst ever.  Batman and Robin was cause I auditioned for that movie.  Oh, that's the gentleman who's done that, L.L. Cool J. Cop Show. I don't know that right. Schwarzenegger was in. Yeah, but I would freeze your guy. Right, right, right. But that guy was Robin.  Oh, he was Robin Damaso, Donna Chris O'Donnell.  And he's on that cop show with L.L. Cool J. Oh, I missed that one yesterday.  Going back to Cali is my fucking playlist. Hey, I'm walking out. I like that song.  Bikini Small Fields Tall.  She said she likes the ocean. That gets your song, man.  It's a great workout song. I put rocky music. Oh, you're hardcore. Too much trumpet for me.  It's a lot of trumpets too to needy. I get really pumped up when I hear a trumpet though.  Yeah, well, if you were running and Rocky came on. Yeah I would see it though. But like in the regular world you don't wanna listen to it. We talking about it for God.  Like I like, I think we're talking about something and then we get on to our workout music and I'm fucking around get into something important.  Yeah, it's really possible. I had meeting on the weekend. I'm so glad to do this podcast with you. I've been having all these. Thank you for having me.  I don't I can't. Yesterday was my friend Brett Weinstein.  He's an evolutionary biologist and one of the smartest fucking people I've ever met. So it goes from him to this goofy conversation.  It's awesome. That's what I feel like, people listening here, so many smart people and. Yeah, but they weren't funny people. It's not that I'm an idiot, but I'm definitely warmed.  And and people have been smoking, which is I don't approve of this. People like fun.  Yeah, we have. We're Americans. God, goddammit. God damn. That's right. And I bought a surfboard that came today and I want to surf. Yeah. You're going to surf and I surf now you should get a lesson.  Don't die like you. You can't really want you to survive. You can't die surfing. You definitely can die. You've never surfed. You're right. You're right. But I do know people who have told me they almost died surfing. How did they die, sir? They got hit with the fucking wave and brought under. They didn't think they were going to get back up. Dude, come on, man.  Wow. I think I can get ADNOC from a surfboard.  You know, the scariest thing I ever heard anybody talk about what the ocean was, not just that this guy died in San Diego.  They were all training for like a triathlon and he got bitten by a shark in front of everybody. So they're all full on half a million.  Great White just takes him and fucking rips him in half in front of everybody.  And you're awake and you're in the water and you are hundreds of yards from the shore and the guy next to you just exploded with a sea monster, just jumped out and ripped him in half. And, you know, blood fuels shark frenzies. Yeah. And you go real slow.  You can't really even swim fast at your fastest. You're fucked. You're trying to maintain a certain pace because you want to run out of gas. Yeah, right. You don't to be able to splash around. You look like my.  Well, my friend Peter Attia, he swam those waters shortly afterwards because he's preparing for some crazy Hawaiian swim. Yeah, we swam from like Maui to the big island. What was what was the distance? He swam something really insane. He swam from Maui to the big island. And I think he might have swam to Lanai as well. Like all, he tried to do it all in one day. So he's in these shark infested waters, the tiger sharks all around the Hawaii, and they're real aggressive.  That's where he's going to go swim after he's training for swimming right where the guy got bitten in half by a shark like a week ago. Why would he do that?  You know, man, I don't know. People are different anyway.  People are different. She comes surfing when they did. I'm scared. Are you scared of sharks?  One hundred percent. Yeah. Because you are potential prey when you get in the water.  Yeah, I'm a pussy. I'm not I'm not into getting eaten by a shark. I just don't think you have many options for survival if one tries to get you and I know my speed and the hero I know fast and I'm very quick search underwater.  I think a seal is going to sell you out, push you towards a shark. That's what I'm worried about.  Probably surf with a seal. Just tidiest. Get your water. Get that's the first. Yeah. It'll be like, oh, he loves SEALs. This is Kyle and this is Buddy. The seal really the seals just there's a shark boom and they catch you. TMZ catches you kicking the seal into the water. TMZ, the shark snatches is directed to TMZ.  Get you. They get me, you know, paparazzi and they I've talked to the TMZ.  Most are TMZ guys. A lot of them were comics. So you'd run into them at the airport? Yeah, they were usually pretty cool. Yeah.  Good guys. They're just doing a job, you know, it's just a weird look. It's weird to not be famous and to see famous people and go work in a film.  That's right. They have a great life right there on film, it seems like.  But the people in all, honestly, they've always been pretty respect. If you tell them, you know, I'm too exhausted, I can't answer this complicated question after I just flew all night, you know. Yeah, because that's what a lot of it is, right? If you're fucking coming out of an airport and you're high on edibles, which I usually of course, that's how I'm flying. And I have a Starbucks in my hand and I'm listening to Jimi Hendrix.  And some dude asked me, you know, what do you think about Black Lives Matter? I'm like, whoa, it's a loaded question right here. Yeah. You know, or anything any any important issue where you could be like, you know, what do you think about Biden or Trump? What what kind of answer am I going to give you? High as fuck. Hold on to a Starbucks.  It is the worst time to be grilled, especially if you don't when you're flying. You got to just accept the fact you're flying, right. He just sit there and you just sit there and you listen to music or you look at a movie on your laptop. You're basically just sitting there chillin.  You accept where you are and then you get off, huh? You get your coffee, you start walking.  And there's a question about life, like, I'm not thinking about life. I'm just chillin. I'm trying to not think like this is my not think time. This is not like I'm going to do a podcast. Let me wake up and get ready to do a pot or I'm about to stand up. Let me wrap my brain up now.  This is like getting off of a plane.  I mean, the worst answers ever. I don't know what the fuck I'm saying.  And I think people go to you a little bit because you. Because your podcast to to you for answers like the last, you know, Kendall Jenner, something different than they're going to ask you.  I'm not a guy on it for answers. Trust me, I'm a guy that can point you to people that might have answers, but I'm not the answer.  You got a lot you got a wide range of knowledge, though.  Yeah, but it doesn't glue together, right. It's scattered. It's basically inoperable. It's great for bringing things up on a podcast. It's not great for, like, real world applications. Yeah. You know, I just have weird facts about the comanche's stored in my head.  I know science things, which is completely useless, but it's not.  It's the whole reason why we're here. I don't know why people science, data science as I should be. It is it's amazing that we make actual discoveries that I think are even more magical than religion. Some of the religion stories and people don't they're almost like scientists are elite nerds or something, not cool to people.  And I think without science, you would just be in the woods pooping in a hole and you'd die in a week.  Well, I think we got two things going on simultaneously.  We have the biological needs and biological needs mean that, like men are still in some way rewarded for being like big, strong physical specimens, like a big football player or, you know, some elite athlete.  It's like biologically a woman's body will tell her, like that is a man to breed with. I'm going to make strong offspring. There's no ifs, ands or buts about it. I just it is what it is. I know. You're right. Yeah. Yeah. So because of that, these guys have the resources and the bandwidth to create all the things they create. Dumb guys who get a lot of pussy ain't inventing shit. Yeah. Any time.  I'll tell you, I think in that way there's an app that, that makes me handsome and I'll be zooming, you know, we recorded stuff with like Kurt. Yeah. And I'll tell you, I relaxed, confident in me.  And just because my jaw is slightly bigger, you know, and I just I get a whole new person out.  I realize I developed this like, yeah, personality is the face I just was given.  But on the other hand, one of the reasons why you're so funny is the perspective of life that you have coming from someone who's not totally happy with your appearance.  No, I was just a very tiny and did not go off.  And my sister wanted a sister and I was born. I was constantly dressed up in makeup as a girl and she'd call me Kaleena. And I did live like, oh, like a girl I was my whole life.  I've had women just like like on me. Just tell me what to do. And I ended up like my I took tap and jazz with my mother.  I didn't want to do that. Oh, my God. I went to get the tap shoes and the guy was like, one day we'll see you on Broadway.  And we're thinking like, I don't want to.  I think they kind of raised me to be a like a woman. This sounds like the beginning of a biography of a serial killer. Yes. This is what it sounds like.  I still haven't just tortured by your mom. You really you wanted to play baseball? Yeah. Go fishing.  And she's like the climate as a gay man. If it's the last I mean, I remember my parents found a nude man.  They weren't even near the women in underwear under my bed. My dad was like like a little relieved now that he was everywhere against me being gay.  But he was like, I thought you were gay, but he didn't want me to have a life, probably. Right.  I mean, look, I'm built like not a tough man. I'm not built like I'm proud to be one of your softest friends.  But didn't you tell me I know you're doing a prison workout?  Yeah. Now I'm going to be huge Botanica that I'll be here. What are you doing? Try to keep up with it together and shit. I got bricks wrapped them in duct tape, gorilla duct tape really. And you lift the weights of bricks. Yeah. I'm getting I'll be huge by the end of the. You really could do that.  It's actually it's getting all the muscles. You know, I read a story once. There's a guy I was talking about how to become a power lifter. He was explaining to people what what to do to become a power lifter. And one of the pieces of advice he was giving is get a manual labor job. Yeah. Was literally saying, you want to get really strong, you want to lift it night after work, but you want to work all day, like picking up bricks and shit, just like this guy was like his strategy for being a stronger power lifter was get a job carrying rocks all day.  Yeah, I dug I bought all these fake plants from my front yard, like 13 of them. And they're like, you want us to help you dig a hole? Like, I got it.  I swear the dirt was so hard it took me about three hours per hole.  And I just did it because I was like, this is great exercise, great exercise and holy crap. My doctor, Dr. Mark Gordon, he does it. He's been on this podcast before. He actually does that for exercise. He'll go out in his backyard. Just dig a hole.  Yeah, digging a hole gets pretty much everything. And I go, What are you doing with the Holy Ghost?  Nothing. Fill it in. Just digging a hole, doing it for us and saying, you know, he's going to. He's got a project, though, at least he's a bright man, he realizes that, first of all, when you think about digging a hole, like honestly as someone I mean, I'm not a kinesiologist, but I understand a little bit about exercise when you're it's a smart word for a guy who knows exercise when you hold on to a pole and you fucking shove it into the ground with your leg.  And, yeah, that's what I did. That's a workout, man. Yeah, that's a real workout, what I do. And it's a workout that works. Everything works. Your whole body, as long as you keep switching legs and switch the way you pull the thing, you're going to use both sides your back. You don't wanna do this way. You hit yourself in the face. You do this shit in this shit. And depending upon, obviously, the size of the handle of the shovel.  But you can get a real workout shovel in, man, just fucking shoveling things to the ground, stomping on it, taking a hole is and then chucking it.  I mean, it's all shoulders and neck and back.  I want this guy to feel some satisfaction, like I put in some ficus trees. I got some nice curb appeal. Yeah, he's out there digging holes.  And I understand that you come to someone maybe do charity work where people need holes, you know?  I mean. Yeah, telesco to do it.  Well, it's his yard man. He wants to have a nice green lawn so he gets Demoratic.  Look at you, make you look good, act you, you will bend to the will of my visual pleasure. I'll tell you what I did.  I got some, some quotes on turf, fake grass. So that's stuff how you feel about that. Hate that stuff. Let's look at the house ones that had that the whole side yard was all it was a beautiful house, but it was it the good turf or was it really good turf, though?  Well, you only could tell because they told you I mean, once you got on it, you could tell. But it's still beautiful. But I don't like it because I want I mean, I'd rather have like a bunch of patches of dirt and some grass, and I want the fucking earth there. I don't want a plastic toupee that pretends to be OK. I could see that. Get the fuck out of here. Plastic toupee that pretends to be plants.  I want grass. If you saw my daughter on my lawn. Is all your lawn, bro.  Dude, don't talk about a lot of I got you. Yeah there's I mean would you want to do lawn in the fake grass.  I am. I'm getting a quote. If it's a good price I'm going to do it because I try to do grass and it's been a nightmare. I can't get these weeds to get out of my face.  Don't be a pussy. What one due to my butt in my neighborhood as fake grass. And I swear to God, when I take my dog, it's a nice fellow. I'm sure no harm against him. It's got a house of fake grass in the front. My dog pisses on every time he's like this. What is this is he steps in like you can see, looks down his feet.  Oh fuck. Is this this is it. Even grass he pisses on every time he walks by it. I think actually how do I get that dog crap out of it?  You can't give the dog crap. It stays forever and then it becomes a new thing. I forget. I hate to new new bacteria leap's hosts.  I'll be patient zero for the next Kovil covid twenty.  I mean I'm sure they make it where you can't tell but it's not. Nothing's grown through that man you're covering over that.  We showed a picture of my my lawn and I think you'd feel differently.  It's a disaster. I don't give a fuck. I don't think he's a coward. I think you care about my lawn.  No, I'd be like, put some time into it or don't I don't cover it with some plastic.  I put so much time. I just want to be I may put just I don't know what to do. Who cares anyway.  Listen, isn't it strange, though, that like like a garden is so much more pleasant than just plants that you see on your own, like a garden? It's like I put this into the ground, gave it life. Look at my tomato plants. Yeah.  Yeah, that's cool. Have you ever had a salad from your own yard now? It's weirdly satisfying, man. Weird is weirdly satisfying. Had an orange from a tree. So that's great too. Yeah. An orange from your own tree. That's awesome. That was done by neighbors but it's something about like look, if you can grow the lettuce, grow the tomatoes, grow some bell peppers and some onions, grow all that stuff mixed together with a little balsamic vinaigrette, grow the carrots, chop them up, put them in the salad and you're eating.  That's how you like. Holy shit, I grew this thing. This is crazy.  You know that. I think baby carrots were baby carrots. What are they? Their carrots. They just made small.  They just really little. They know they just got actual carrots and they shaved them small.  Oh there's no baby carrots.  I might be people that I may be trolled. That's a people are assholes who are telling you it's a baby carrot. It's old grandpa carrot.  I'm wondering they shaved down Grandpa Carrot.  Oh, man. I got I got it. It's hard for me to put on weight. I go all gutt this way. My my whole family is these giant barrels and then twig legs like and then they come waltzing up. It looks disgusting. I'm constantly fighting it and I you know, my neck is a quick story. OK, I woke up one day.  Here's a dream I was having what was turning got out of bed. I'm turning the top of a of a coke can the top off.  OK, Rensuke. Kicking it off six foot, can I wake up with a can of Coke, bottle of Coke? It's a dream I'm having. Oh, I wake up. There's still expensive.  Really bad for you. A lot of calories. Sorry. So I wake up with my hands wrapped around my head. I was twisting my own head.  So I go to the doctor feeling like an idiot. Oh my God, that's so crazy.  They x rayed my my neck, you know, and they put on the wall and this doctor was rubbing his chin looking at my neck like you don't want a doctor confused, looking at your skeletal.  Yeah, but you want I'm super confident. Right. And everything looks normal. Right.  And he goes Jonathan calls another guy in and now they're both just like looking at my neck and I'm thinking I'm dying.  All right. If you were a doctor and some guy comes in and he's a patient and you say, well, I'm just going to give you a little x ray and check to see what's going on. And x ray, I'm. And he's got all these weird bones he's not supposed to have. Yes, entire spinal structure is totally different, everything's different, the whole thing's different, and the doctor looks and he goes, what what's going on here?  And he goes, shut the fuck up.  This is another good porn because he's from another planet.  Yeah, it's infiltrating. And then the nurses come in. Bloem Yeah. They're all sarcastic. This piece in a galaxy again. I love it. He so he looks at and the lumberjack women show.  Oh yeah. The Lumber Jills. This is just been a podcast of great porn.  Some of the scribbling, some porn writers doing a lot of spread. I hope so. It was funny I texted Tom SIGIR detective or did I put it online. I think I might have tweeted it. Is anybody made covid porn yet that Tom Sagara immediately immediately texted me a photo of this lady with a fucking covid mask on and some guys grabbing her ass? I'm like, this is crazy. So then he says, Real link. I go to it.  It is a covid porn. Like two days after the locked out party gets up.  I wonder how many views. I'm just curious. Was it billions of views now?  Billions. Everyone's jerked off to it. Yeah. Yeah. To get on that. Imagine that's the that's the that's the, the thrill.  Yeah. I might get a fire a fucking during a pandemic. It is kind of hot. Women like covering up any thing they covered up even though these they cover their ankles or like man I got to see those ankles. Right. It's like it was risky to show your ankles dirty whore. Now they're covering their mouths.  Yeah. They have a lot of power.  But again, it's the change of culture like we were talking about. This is imagine living in a time just a few hundred years ago. Well, women had to cover their ankles, but you had your hand.  You have a blouse that goes all the way down the floor. Crazy.  But people were so animalistic. I bet men were so out of control and disgusting that you kind of had to obscure the shape of your body or they would just try to rape you. Man, I bet hundreds of years ago I was like most guys, raped. That's what I think. Yeah. I bet if you go back like 4000 years ago, I, I think rape is like insanely common.  Insanely common. Yeah.  Like we're going to talk about Genghis Khan and his his DNA is in like something like five Asian people, the the perve men rape, DNA gets spread.  Yeah, exactly.  And then all, all of us. But the balance is the scientists don't get pussy so they don't get distracted. And so they figure things out. Those big gigantic football player dudes that are just fucking storm style, just like we're like a fucking sandstorm, just throwing dick all over the place.  Those guys will invent anything.  No, it's like you almost need to have no distractions. And the best way to have no distractions is no one wants to fuck you. We'll be right back. I mean, nobody wants to say this, right, but when you think of, like, weird sort of antisocial behavior, people, people getting locked into an online world, people getting disconnected from human beings, you know, all all of this is that's not a good trend that's happening more than ever.  And then with covid, it's gets ramped up even more because you have to do it that way. Yeah. I feel like I went full circle on the being stuck alone and now I was lonely for a while and I'm fine. I don't know if maybe I'm turning a psychopath, but you're about there, right? Right about that door, the psychopathic. Yeah, surfing.  That's an interesting thing to do. I'm assuming what surfing looks like. It's so fun.  It's even being terrible at it is so fun. You just wipe out and it's so fun.  Oh, I didn't finish my next story. Oh, you're high.  Yeah, we're super. We're sorry, folks. Sorry, folks. Florida, I went off on an alien autopsy. Sorry, it's not a great story.  It's just I'm someone's listening to I feel like. What happened to your neck, right? The doctor turns me.  He goes because I was like, what is it? My dying? And he goes, You have the neck of a seven foot man.  Well, that's the end of that story. So you have a very long neck. Yeah.  Why I brought this up, I'll never know. I think I was talking about my weird body. Don't now you're looking at my neck. It's normal. I'm hunching.  I got a hodgett. Yeah. You guys look at a your progress. I want to come back because that handsome app also makes my shoulders big and stuff is cool.  Crisper was just used to successfully treat some disease.  What I bought CRISPR, I don't have many stocks but I did CRISPR and Tesla. Yeah. Good moves. What was it?  Jimmy said he bought it.  I was like, OK, well, stock grow Rice Krispies. Yeah, that's a lot of money. How much do you have. I already bought crisper and that you found out about.  Holy fuck bro. But here it is all pretty with inherited diseases successfully treated with CRISPR.  So this is what the real fascinating thing about CRISPR is, is that they're going to be able to cure a bunch of diseases through it. And here it is to people with bait. Boy, say that word beta. So the thalassaemia and one with sickle cell disease no longer require blood transfusions, which are normally used to to treat severe forms of these inherited diseases after their bone marrow stem cells were gene edited with CRISPR.  So they too, they edited their bone marrow stem cells.  That's where we're going. Holy shit. The preliminary results demonstrate, in essence, a functional cure for patients with beta thalassemia and sickle cell anemia, a functional cure.  So they've figured out a fucking cure for sickle cell man.  Yeah, I think this is crazy. I think you're going to go to your doctor with your genes. Yes. I think what we're looking at now is the tip of the tip of the iceberg, the beginning steps of this kind of technology. They're going to be able to edit people. They're going to be able to make you the rock. You're going to look like the rock can shrink my neck. They're going to shrink. You know, they're gonna give you a body to match your neck.  The right, seven feet tall. Yeah, you have to be the rock. I saw the Rocky years ago.  He's at my gym at Gold's. We're going like 2001, like early young rock before he's got got a stack of hamburgers, like twelve hamburgers. You said he's enormous.  You don't realize how enormous it is until you see him in real life, like, oh criminy yeah. But in the future, look, that's an anomaly to be that big, like as big as he is and handsome and so charismatic, but all of those things are just an anomaly for them all to be together. But what if you could just edit someone's genes and turn them into a specimen like the rock? Be real weird, man.  Oh, you think they could edit how you think so come out? I think they're going to be looking at how you are. Look at that.  Jesus, son. Got a fucking flag in the background, built a brick shit house, determined, covered with real sweat that he earned you thought American, you pansy ass fucks.  That's the greatest American that's ever lived. I mean, I think it might be tough to to edit my phone, your jawline or snow and just inject you with some fucking architectural or the whole thing they have mapped out.  You only want to look like map out your frame and then you just shake like, do you remember that movie with God damn it, when I remember what it is?  It was a Vietnam movie, a real trippy movie with this, the guy that was in Shawshank Redemption.  What was his name? Oh. Oh, crap.  The white guy, Tim Rob and Tim Robbins. OK, Tim Robbins was in a Vietnam movie where they gave the ladder.  Jacob's Ladder. That's right. The idea was that the whole movie I don't want spoiler alert was kind of like LSD or some psychedelic induced dream that the government gave a psychedelic and gave him this crazy induced fucked up dream.  But you that's how you go. So they would put you in some fucking cocoon and you would shake this LSD people in Jacob's ladder and then boom, you come out the rock.  Well, that's what's going to happen. There's going to be no exceptional people. There's going to be no people that are any different. Everyone is going to be perfect. But then it's going to be like living in that Jay-Z video every day, doo doo doo. Everyone's going to get bored. I don't believe that's going to happen.  It's going to happen. We're going to fuck it up. We're going to fuck it up. Like we fucked up the environment and the ocean and birth control here. We fucked up everything, like we fucked up everything we've ever done. We're going to fuck it up because we fuck up everything, we fuck up everything. And then we figure out what we fucked up and then we try to fuck it.  Right. Well, I'll tell you, this is what's next. It is Jacob's Ladder, 1990.  And this we will for sure fuck up because with the Tesla car and they're solving vision now, they're going to be able to put this in robots a little walk around your house like make your sandwich.  And when you get a robot girlfriend or boyfriend that can make you laugh is it has all this information, does things for you all. This is nice.  What what is going on? And then when you want to be alone, she goes into the closet and turns up. What does it got to do with relationships?  Well, it depends if you're a bitch or not. It's basically the same thing as the other things we're talking about.  You get you can't live in a Jay-Z movie forever. You can't have the fucking hot made. That just sucks your dick any time you want. Well, you have to have a relationship with an actual human being. Well, now, wait a minute. I'm talking more fun than the robot fuck doll lady. But just keep program robot fuck lady to be kind of a bitch.  Sometimes you can program to the point when the real difference wouldn't be real.  It wouldn't be her decision. You want a human. It's just you're always going to be annoyed with something that's not a human. It's going to be too easy. It's like playing a game of quake with God mode on when you can't be killed and just running over everything you get bored. Part of the fun is you can get shot in the head, but it's like a chess game chess app.  You go to the higher level.  You it's not real, though, you know, it's not real until you don't. And then when you don't, it becomes effective again. But while you know it's not real, you're never going to accept it. Well, you know, this robot lady, you just suck your dick like suck my dick, robot lady, you can't even get hard.  But, you know, I know you assholes suck your own car and you get so spicy we don't want that man.  It seems like you want that because you can't have you know what that is.  You're talking to a beautiful woman who's like wearing lingerie, who just does whatever you want.  And it's like but you're no person should do what you want. You can program her to be exactly like you're paying for her to just be a regular person. This is bullshit change. You just get a regular person. You could be from the south, one little blonde hair. Look, you're in a good relationship, but imagine guys who can't get laid.  That is imagine. I think we need to remove part of their brain so they believe that robots real.  I'm not against that, actually. And the robots programmed to make them a better person. We're robots programmed to be almost like a great woman. Your life is inspires you to be a better thank you. This is what's going to happen. Yes, we could do that.  But they have to be morons. They have to be morons, or the robots have to be way better than they are right now. They have to be like the simulation has to be better than actual reality so that you initially submit to it. I disagree. Yeah. It's like a Republican tax plan.  They talk you into, like, listen, all you have to eventually this is going to work out in your benefit. But right now you get to submit to leaving all of your consciousness in this alternative recreated dimension. Don't worry, your physical body will be safe and fine. We just we're going to offer you a five minute trial. But here's the pros. You never have to worry about your bills again. Everything is paid for and you live like a rock star for the rest of your life and you stay alive the same amount of time.  So what are you doing? Do you really want to just fucking struggle and get beat up by the cops and fucking lose your job because of corporate in this? They're downsizing. They don't give a fuck how much money you put in this fucking company. Would you like would you want to do it the hard way or do you want to stay alive the same amount of time. But we just connect you to a machine and the memories and life that we give you is far more exciting.  It's amazing. You're a super hero. You're the king of the world. You're on top of everything. You live like your Dr. Manhattan. But it's not binary like that.  You can have something a little in between, maybe not. Maybe once they hit the switch, they say, listen, just try it, just try.  And then he can give you a free weekend.  They give you a free weekend, they one hundred percent and they use a free weekend and everybody gets it. Everybody at the first it free. I thought Mike like working at the sawmill. He doesn't anymore. He wants to be Dr. Manhattan. He wants to be one of the watchmen. He wants to he wants to be on Mars, just jerking off. That's what he wants to do when how popular that one would be.  I picked the Mars jerk off package. Do you think we're in a simulation? Are you some.  I'm way too stupid to know, but smart people do. Elon does again, go back to Elon. He thinks we're in a simulation.  Well, OK. So he's smarter than before. He's he's I should say this. Well, I want to put words in my mouth, think he's very open to entertaining the idea that we're in a simulation and that it's very possible that we're in a simulation. Yes. But I think it's a factor of what actual life is. That's what I think. What do you mean? I think what what we're thinking of us being in a simulation, I think maybe we need to look at it even bigger.  Like maybe that's a factor. Of what life is that life always has this weird, fucked up theatrical quality, it always feels fake and it's influenced a certain amount, by the way, we think not just it's not just a physical thing. Just like when people are mad at you, it feels terrible. Like if you said something at work to a guy and you regret it and you got to go there the next day and see him, you got to run and you feel bad.  We feel bad. I feel bad. People feel bad when they have bad interactions with each other. We're not just like we're not just. We're definitely not individuals that are disconnected from everyone around them. If people around you have bad feelings, you feel bad. There's no getting around that. So there's some shit going on with people. It's way deeper than just just like words and looking at each other. There's like energy that's being transferred back and forth between people.  It just hasn't been defined yet.  Well, I'm definitely a little high as I was really hard for me to follow.  But also they found recently we are pixels, you know, that the smallest the Planck length, I think it's called like a triangle. So you literally could make this you actually you don't touch anything, you know that to you know, you never actually touch anything.  Atoms don't touch. Right. I mean, that's another this there's some things that are disturbing.  But if someone touches you, they touch you. Well, by that you can say no one ever gives anybody. It's just like no one ever touches. Well, I guess you didn't define the word touch.  You never actually whatever beats anybody up, you can't touch each other. No assault is real. Well, now, no car accidents are real because no one ever touches anybody. I'm still funny.  You don't care about my lawn. But listen, I do want to any plastic. The point is they're going to make robots, robot girlfriends. And I don't know which sex is a good question for you to answer.  Which sex will be more mad.  The females got these guys who have these sex, these robots that are they're not dating anymore because they love this and or women or will men mad because women are totally satisfied with a guy that's like what happened at work?  What all the what if all the robots that the women chose were seven foot Jamaican dudes with dreadlocks? That's what they wanted. And that was like the most popular robot fuck dolls for ladies.  They're called opposite Kyle's just giant super athlete, Big Dong fellas with dreadlocks probably. Yeah, those would sell well.  I mean, why guys would be so mad. Everybody would be mad. I mean, a lot of Jews would be upset, you think about how many old people are are sad and lonely, their wife died, their husband died, and then you can give them this Viking, Dick Cheney, to shoot him with scars on his face.  His shoulders have dried, blood splattered on them. And he just really fucks your grandmother. He listens. Good to her. It's so hard looking at her to. And he wants to know about her stories.  Oh, he gets so hard when she crochets. It's hard as a rock. Just imagine you got your grandmother, a fucking Viking robot doll.  What a gift. He shows up like wolf skins around his shoulders and shit.  Your grandma here. Yes, yes. She's right this way. Just dragging a fucking axe with him as he walks in the house.  I don't I think we're 20 years away from this and not. Well, I think that's ridiculous.  It's not ridiculous because here's the thing, man. If you think about what what makes someone attracted to someone, right? If you say, OK, well, a guy would be attracted to a woman who has a great personality and she's fun to be around. She's got a pretty face and a nice body. But that's some evolutionary code. The same reason why a woman is attracted to a big, giant, strong man. Like that's good genes, like there's some evolutionary code.  What if they got in there with the CRISPR and just fucking monkey wrench that shit and you only sexually attracted to dying people?  Like, that's it. Like they can send you to a cancer ward and you just go on a fuck fast. Yeah. Because that's your thing. And syphilis wrong. These dudes that live in this cancer ward, they lay dying, you know, but if some hot robot lady that they program or that some person, this program, the person being attracted to that that person thing, they'll you'd ruin that person's life.  But a robot.  Yeah, a robot. Yeah, but what was but what if the robots so good it's really indistinguishable from a person then when does the robot have rights.  We've got to get on this robot. It's got to look man, we can't make that mistake. You know, as human beings, we've already decided that other humans that aren't like us are not equal to us. Yeah. What if we eventually invent a fucking robot that has all the characteristics of us, including it feels pain and has emotions and we decide that it's not. Oh my God, have we not learned from all of the years of horrors that we've inflicted upon our fellow man?  We're going to now do this to these sentient robots? Well, we got to try to make them.  We're not going to stop. I always go to the scene in Ex Machina when that lady just leaves.  When she in the helicopter, she just leaves open the door.  He knows he's going to suffocate in there. Yeah, he's pounded on that big, thick Plexiglas. You know, he's never getting out and she has no emotion, walks towards the helicopter.  What if this is a simulation, an hour? This has happened over and over.  Our job is to create the machines that then like our purpose, we find out, is to create the machines.  That makes a lot of sense.  And this just happens over and over these these little beings that get little smart. And then they make us again and then we make another universe.  I had a joke I did a long time ago about the Big Bang Theory.  That like, what if the Big Bang Theory is just like what people figure out, like they get to a point where someone takes like 14 billion years, they get to the point where something can invent a button, you press that button, it resets time, and then they're all sitting around staring at it. And one dude with like, oh, he's got like autism and he's on Red Bull and no one's ever touched his dick. And he's like, fucking I'll press it.  Right. And he presses that button and bang the whole universe explode and then contracts and then starts all over again. Yeah. And it's a big bang and every 14 plus billion years. We figure out how to make a big bang. Yeah, I mean, maybe if you think about what we're doing and what we used to be able to do, think about when I was talking about the comanche's in that pistol, there was a big deal in 1840.  Someone figured out how to make a revolver, right? Yeah. That ain't shit now. Yeah. You keep going. Way, way, way, way, way, way, way into the future. Why is a big bang button preposterous? I don't think it is. No.  And it we're clearly missing so much information like the Big Bang, right? Well, I did way more information. Did it used to be house small.  Right. The whole universe was smaller than the head of a pin in the gut.  And I got my aunt aunt right a lot. But it just doesn't seem it seems like there's a huge piece.  Well, I put that story right up there with a Licia and the two bears. Oh, yeah. Same story. Yeah. Who the fuck knows what happened? But we know in the Sheba's two boys, we got some we got some data.  At least the Sheba's got zero. You know, we have yeah.  We have the sound. It's coming from 14 billion years ago or whatever it is, thirteen point nine billion years ago.  The weird thing is we're missing. Gravity is weird. Where does that go? Well, not just that. Like what about dark matter? Explain that to me. Dark matter and dark energy. Explain it. They don't really know.  They know what it does. They know the impact it has. Yeah. That's what I call it. Dark matter because they're dark on it. It's not fun interviewing my dad on tonight's episode of Triggered, we covered many topics, but there was only one thing I really wanted to know.  Are aliens real Fairclough pull all the scrolls aliens.  Because this is the only thing I really want to know.  I want to know what's going on. Would you ever open up Roswell to let us know what's really going on? He's terrified of his dad.  So that's a teaser, it's coming out tonight. Oh, my God. Son of a bitch. They got us. They got us, they got us.  Aliens know these fucking these people got us to tune into this event. I do want to see they got us they cut it off right at the very quick. Just if it's so important. Can you tell us what the suspense is supposed to be? The president. This isn't about ratings. Are you an alien?  Do you think aliens are here? Yes.  What are your what you basically just my imagination and hopes and dreams. I say no way. And I'll tell you why. First of all, the people understood how far away things.  Other stars. You're so right. If people understood the idea of sending a video from a phone to another phone in a matter of seconds, do you know how crazy that is? That sounds impossible. It can't be done. But first of all, what's a video? But how is it made and how does it go through the air and land? Perfectly on Kyle's phone airdrop? What the fuck is an airdrop?  All those things. I do not disclaim what I'm saying.  Don't at least the times when you wish you were smarter.  You just tell every guy. I just was a little bit.  Nobut discredit, right? The speed of light.  You physically can't go faster because your mass to be infinite. So we get our closest stars for light years away. It takes a second for light to go to the moon and it took us almost a week to get there, going 18000 miles an hour.  We are going for four years.  I just and also, if you've got to go that far, aren't you going to say hello?  And you're not just going to be in the sky and I don't know, tell you everything you said. It's very good. Very important. I don't think that all we know about propulsion and the ability to travel through space and time is the same, right? That's a civilization that's been around for thousands of years longer than us. So if there is a civilization out there and I'm not saying there is, but if scientists believe that there should be, I mean, there was a recent thing they were talking about there, doing some sort of an equation about our own galaxy that said there might be as many as 36 intelligent life forms in terms of planets occupied by intelligent life forms in our galaxy.  So they don't really know. They're just kind of guessing. But you got to assume that if it happened once in the right set of circumstances, it could happen again if given enough time and the planet doesn't get blown up. Now, if what we know about people in 2020, I mean, we like we're talking about sending videos to the air and fucking space axes, shooting people in the space, again, docking at the space station. And there's a lot of crazy shit we're doing that didn't exist at all 100 years ago.  So if we went a thousand years from now, how fucking bonkers would be the inventions? You've got to assume that each invention exponentially encourages more inventions to branch off of it.  But it doesn't always mean when you look at we started off with planes, you know, the Wright brothers, and then we very quickly get into propellers and jet engines. And then we were rocketing, you know, to the moon and like this.  And then so we were like, oh, in eighty five with flying cars because that was the trajectory and it just went well.  They do have flying cars. They just don't use them and they're not very good, but they do exist. You can do it.  But the ones that we were imagining would be in the 80s totally and probably I mean that flattened off.  But but there's also problems of everybody having a helicopter. You know, helicopters were supposed to be the next form of transportation when the helicopter was invented. It was invented to people thought that was going to replace the car. You're going to be able to just fucking fly around the whole neighborhood. So there'd be so loud.  Fucking twat always lands a fucking helicopter when I'm trying to take a nap.  That's but that's I think it's it's still it doesn't mean we can't do it.  You could everybody could have a helicopter. It's just not practical. People can afford it. You can't land a sky, can't be full of helicopters. The way the goddamn road is filled with cars we'd be dying, could be slamming into each other left and right. Like how would you make clear lanes and paths.  Maybe it could be done, maybe could be done in the future. Maybe it'll be more efficient or more energy efficient or won't you know, it'll be electric. So fuck up the environment or something. Oh yeah. But they can do it.  I mean, on the alien thing, I 100 percent think there's life on other plants. I mean, just they found every star that they've looked at and they've got telescopes have planets around it.  They didn't know that until recently. So then you have to multiply how many more chances are of life.  And it's not only that it would be bizarre. Wasn't the pictures they have of these planets are dogshit. They're nothing to nothing. You look you can see pictures of the moon and they're awesome pictures, but pictures of planets in other galaxies. You get like a speck, you get like a speck. Or they just they recognized, by the way, the sun wobble. Sometimes you find yeah, they find what the star is and they recognize that there's like a certain kind of a wobble.  And it's just coming to. Tyreek Hill, yeah, pretty cool. So they figure out that a planet circling it, but there's no like real good photos, like we have photos of Venus. It's insane, right? Like you see the like Saturn or Jupiter. Jupiter's photos are amazing. Man there. Pull up a photo of Jupiter.  And I want to I, I have a Saturn man. See, that's a photo that we have. Just imagine if you are floating around near that thing and you could look at it and realize, here's this lifeless, massive object that shares of shares a solar system with us.  I have a telescope in my lawn. I can see Saturn's rings. Really? I could see Jupiter's. Oh, dude, you're one of those guys. It's 845 million miles.  Wow. But pull up a Jupiter photo.  I remember there was a an event that happened. I don't remember what year it was, but a giant asteroid slammed into it. Yeah. And they realized, oh, wait a minute, they are way bigger than we thought.  Like, when that happens, an asteroid slammed into Jupiter and the explosion was larger than the size of the Earth.  Yeah, they have pictures of that. I think that's true. Yeah, that might have made that up. No, you're right. Look at that man. Like, that's the impact we need, that big planet cannot change the color of the stripe. I heard that we're so we wouldn't be here without Jupiter because it's scoops up a lot of the asteroids.  Yeah. Apparently it's so massive that it sucks things into it. Said each SL nine nuclease hurled material into space, which left a large scar when it fell onto Jupiter.  God, it's so amazing to think that there's these enormous Matt, you know, like Miami sized rocks just flying through space and they could just slam into us.  And then everything's off. Everything's off the electricity, the power, the lights, the sun. You can't breathe. You know, if you're anywhere near the impact, you're dead instantly, anywhere near hundreds of miles, even in the atmosphere. I hear you burn up just from the heat of it. Dude, you're so fucked.  You're so triple double fucked that that volcano that you're talking about earlier, what's that supposed to blow up?  Because that'll that'll kill everybody, right?  It's a Caldara supervolcano. It's a volcano that they didn't realize was a volcano until like they started using satellites. I believe they just thought that it was like seismically active hot springs. Yeah, beautiful. So pretty darn convenient. And then one day. Is that the actual impact? Oh, my God.  You can see the impact. Look at that watch that hits and it brings back it up, back it up. Watch this. Look at this.  Here's how it hits the gravity breaks it up, I think, before it hits. And so there's like a bunch of old Pokemon.  Boom, boom, boom, boom. Look at that. So that explosion apparently was the size of the earth. That wasn't fun. If that's true, I could maybe use aliens to find out if that's true.  Was that explosion the size of the earth?  I think we shouldn't check any.  But we were saying just in case, let's just not check. I don't know. All right. But I think it's it's somewhere in that range. But if that hit us, man, that's a wrap.  I think the red dots about our size, the red storm.  And the thing is, man, there's fucking holes all over this planet where it. Hell, yeah, things hit here all the time.  There's like no rhyme or reason to it either. It's not like they wouldn't hit us man. We're like really close to five G nationwide. They don't give a fuck.  Those rocks are flying out of nowhere. And by the way, if you really want to see an end to racism, it'll be when a giant rock is coming from the sky to kill us all that then you realize how stupid it was to care that's going to happen.  Yeah. What will we all trying to feel different?  Racism, sexism, any kind of discrimination, homophobia. All of it's going to seem so stupid when you see a rock flying in the sky like, my God, I've been so distracted.  Yeah. I don't know if they can even knock those things out. That was a little exaggeration that says one group of astronomers estimated the object to be 16 and a half to sixty five feet across.  Oh, same size. But the explosion, didn't they say the explosion was some?  I thought a massive amount. But that's not what I'm saying. What is it what are they saying about the size of the explosion, though? Because that was the thing that they were stunned by. They were stunned by the actual size of the impact area, even though it is a gas giant.  So I don't know how the fuck it even you know, what is what is happening, what's happening when there's a hard core or the bottom, probably.  Right. I don't even know how stupid why it's a gas giant. It's just a gas station. It's just, you know, I would say that real concern, if I knew someone was going to question me, I'd be like, well, you know, Jupiter's a gas giant.  Yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm very confident when my work can't be checked.  Venus hottest planet in the solar system and it's not the closest and it's because of greenhouse gases is actually pumping into our atmosphere while we are not metal on the surface of Venus.  Yeah, things are. I do notice more fires. Mm hmm. Well, the climate is certainly shifting. But here is this is my point. Not that there's anything wrong with recognizing that we're doing irreparable harm to the atmosphere. We definitely are. But we also should be aware that even if we weren't, this motherfucker is not stable. No, it's not. Even if people had a zero impact on the environment, absolute zero. We don't take out.  We don't put back. It's perfect. It's a perfect balance and harmony.  We're still far. We're going to die before that. Yeah, we're still fucked. We need to wrap your head around it. I suppose that could be worded that way, that it was an earth size explosion. It does say that. I mean, when you compare, they told her son, look at that.  I told you. I see. I told you, son, but your son isn't the air nice.  And now I know. I mean, I just have to clean soot off my porch all the time. And now it's what they burnt all those buildings down and cleaned everything out.  Which ones? All the ones they burned down.  All the from the riots. Yeah. Yeah. But the the no working is great for the air, terrible for the economy but super good for the air.  If you are buying a thirty thousand dollar car you have to buy a Tesla.  Well you're doing a Tesla at Alamin too, right. I just feel like. Has it been long. How much are they paying us.  A lot to paint us with. He keeps making cool. Sure. It's amazing. They need. Yeah. I just want him to keep making cool stuff and succeed.  That roadster is fucking vaporware though son. What do you think coming out. Oh yeah. You don't hear a goddamn word I want the roadster. Well Dylan, I love the truck but where's the goddamn roadster.  Everything up but coming home three days old.  What is this. That's it. I can borrow. There's a Porsche, a new Tesla Roadster next to Porsche Tyulkin. That's the Roadster. It could be a CGI version which does look like it is look super easy. Is that really the Roadster?  Oh, it has.  It has the roof on it. It's not really. Oh, I see. God damn. It's beautiful, though. It's going to have rockets in the back.  I think that is what it looks like, though, even though that CGI since my eyes suck anyway for me, I could be tricked. You know what?  I can't be tricked by, though, model cars. What do you mean when I see a photo of a model car, even if it's perfect, it's so weird. I don't know what that is. There's this thing going on.  It's a microscopic look the shadows and write something you're not conscious of.  Whatever it is, I'm like bullshit I call fake, but you know what I mean? Like, how do you know that a model car is fake? But you do.  I haven't honestly tried.  Jamie, Jamie, do me several cars. Google. What do you got here, buddy. I'll tell you. Flying Tesla.  Oh that's right. It lifts off the ground one second.  That's not happening. Zero to 60 in one point. One second.  That's nice. That's the base. Oh, that's not the best basement with the thrusters. With the thrusters.  What kind of nonsense is I just talking about? What was I just saying? I mean, it's just been two hours of jamming anything.  It's hard to hear and read. At the same time, we're talking about model cars. You can tell the difference.  So let's play Erica's favorite fun gania, our picture, rather, of a model car pull up a or a real 1969 Corvette model car. Let's see that. That sounds pretty reasonable also because it's a plastic car like the Corvette is actually a plastic vehicle. Like maybe maybe that would be better, Jimmy also. Or pull up a real one and see if you can tell.  I'm trying to see if I can find a photographer that does magic and see if there's a magic.  Just don't wanna look too hard, but just give me a regular one first.  Just give me a reglan first to base it off of because there's something like instantly you'll know and I don't know how you would ever describe this to other people, especially if I know.  No, I'm OK. I think that's that's a real car, bro. I know that car. That's actually a real car. OK, you son of a bitch. That's what that is, is a first of all, make that bigger again, because I'm a dick.  That is a god damn beautiful.  That is generation three, that's a generation three Corvet maybe like I think between 67 and like in the early 70s, that one's got the side pipes and they got an extra wide body kit on it.  And I got a boner. That's America. Fuck. Yeah. Don't go away from that car or go back to the car, son. Go back to that car. No, no, no. Go back. Go back. Here's the thing. It's not because that one's got a bold white stripe right down the fucking nose. That's ebony and ivory. They live together in perfect harmony. Let's not lose sight of that. Yes. With sideswipes and flared fucking you don't get from a electric car is feeling an engine and pulling on a shifting gears.  You don't get that.  You don't get the wildness. You don't get any. Leonard skittered going on the back of your head. You just get it. But it's still it's better.  It's like if I had to choose like one car to drive the rest of my life, would it be a hot rod every day or a Tesla? I'd be like, I'm going to take the Tesla. I remember the hot rod. It's going to be always the fastest Tesla. It's amazing.  Also just never going to the gas station as such a pleasure.  God, it's so pretty. Just pull up a model car, OK? That's a model car. I don't know, Monica, it's hard to tell the steering wheels. It looks a little fake, but it's a shitty photo. It's hard to tell. It's not resolutions, not very good.  Go to model car photos.  That's what I have. That's what that's what I typed in. And that's that's coming up. Oh, these cunts, they're trying to trick you. There's one. It's not a good picture. All right.  Let's try model car 65 Mustang. Let's try one of those.  Because the problem with these is like it's probably not as many models.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about. And I'm sure there's a lot of I assume there's got to be an Instagram account someone's got. Oh, yeah.  Someone must I click on. I know that I will have a click on that green one or the box. That's a fake one.  OK, there you can tell that's a fake. It's really small. That's fake too though. Yeah.  It's hard to tell. That looks fake as fuck. No, but make it larger. That's a perfect example. Actually look. Yeah. Like something about you like na player.  Right. You're looking at. What is it though.  I don't know Jamie. Look at it. What is it. Something about that, I mean, where it it's like in the middle of a white I don't know, man, I know it's little I want if you put some people around, then some tire marks. No, no, no.  Even I think even if you CGI people onto that picture that we're like normal sized people in relative to that car. Just keep it still for a second. Even if you CGI people on that, you would still be like, I don't buy it. There's something about the perspective. Here's here's one of the things. It's because it's a photograph, right? It's not a digital photograph because you look at how it blurs in the background. Am I right?  Yeah, a little. A little bit. That's just added in. Oh, it's had it in.  OK, could be with the camera. But I think that's also you recognize perspective and you like just by the way the light is playing off that thing it seems off.  Yeah. It does have a force for tilt shift perspective which wouldn't normally happen, which gives things a manager look. Yeah. That makes things look fake. Right. That that might be a real card that they made look fake. Right.  It's amazing what happens in your subconscious. You're driving a wobbler on it.  That is not clear. Let's see. That's a shitty picture, though. You really kind of want to look Instagram account.  Yeah, I bet there's a lot of dudes like seriously into those fucking things. Miniature cars. They have like cool dudes, little displays of around their house.  Would you like to see my anything you collect, I think is that women are into it. There's nothing wrong with that. Oh it's cool.  You collect X do you think when no one's around and make the vroom vroom sound. Oh my god. I had a roommate once. You were that Star Wars came out with a two sided light saber.  Darth Maul. Yeah, I had a roommate. New York was starting to just stand up and I come home and he's on his bed going, wow, wow, wow.  A grown man. But I bet it made him feel happy. Yeah, but then I felt him if they came to him in the middle of the night and they said, listen, you don't have to live this life anymore.  You live the same exact amount of years, but you're going to live as Darth Maul.  Is there ever a time where you would have changed your life? I assume now, like a dark time, like, you know, I'm going to switch this up?  No, I enjoy life. I'm having fun. Yeah, but I think I enjoy this.  This like weird challenges to life. That's part of what's fun about it. Like the part of what's fun is overcoming the things that are not fun. And just like figuring your way through problems and getting better at things and learning things and criticizing yourself and all that shit. Yeah. If you go into the Matrix man, all it's over for the people right there.  That thing I don't think is right about it. I think you can program the Matrix to be annoying and hard.  One hundred percent. If you're going to program it to be life, just fuck it up and make it live. Life is now and then, like, that's the natural course progression. That's the only way to keep entropy. It's the only way to keep things moving. Like you have brought up good and bad. You have to have all the things together. It's the only way things get done. You have to have struggles. Otherwise, no improvement gets made.  You have to have trauma. Otherwise, love is not appreciated. You have all those things. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely. That's like like, like a rich, you know, like what's the thing that people loved the most.  It might be a rich son. Absolutely.  A son who's arrogant didn't have to work for is a piece of shit is to people and he's miserable. He didn't do anything to get it. It's a miserable fuck.  I'm the happiest when I'm working really hard. Right.  And when it's done, like when you make one of those videos and then you get a bunch of positive feedback from it, that's got to be amazingly satisfying.  Yeah, I mean, I do it for free.  And also like Kurt Metzger, help with that last one as well. Curtis but Curtis fucking Solaris, he's great.  And we're doing we're working on making a show and it's like we're working so hard and no one is even asking for it. But it's it's really satisfying.  And I feel like about the money, you just keep doing those goddamn Instagram videos if you can just keep doing them. I think it's undeniable. It's so good. Some of those are so good. So mean.  Yes. I look back. Oh yeah. Oh there's so know.  Well Bill Maher asked for I mean he I didn't want to make a video but marketing getting gangbanged when he came on this program and he said my impression sucked, he's asking what am I supposed to do, sit there. Listen, I'm on your side with that one. He was impressed by the way. It's very it's very funny. He should be laughing at that. That's it was hilarious.  I mean, even if you hate someone's impression, you have to pretend you like it. There's no saying you can't lie.  You can't say it's not good. It's really good. Don't lie.  Well, that he when you said, oh, let's play it, he was like, I'm leaving if you like, threatened to leave. You played it. And by the way, I don't want it.  I really don't mind. I like having a nemesis. It's kind of feels good. So like Bill Maher, I like I really love love. He says the rants that he's been doing during covid have been the very best. You know, the rants that he does, the beginning of his show. I have their great man. They're great. He's doing them with no audience, but they've been really funny and really good. Joints. It's like he's actually ramped it up during this pandemic, is some of those beginning of the show rants are excellent.  He's great writers, so they got great writers, man. It's a it is a you know, it's a treasure that shows a national treasure.  But he did get did he get gangbanged in my video, in your video, you can find all those things together. Exactly.  But also he acted like. All right anyway.  Yes. They didn't exist. He went out to Hawaii with them in his private plane. Yes. I don't know him now in his defense, I'm sure I was invisible to him and he forgot me.  But like you, the beach and to dinners and and then he kind of got because he did know about the videos and he told you he didn't. And then he kind of. Anyway, listen, listen, fine.  I get it. But I think in all due with all due respect, I think he's just looking at it the wrong way.  I think it's funny and I think it doesn't make him any less brilliant. It doesn't make his show any less great in the show is great. I think we both admit it. And those rants are brilliant. They're brilliant. I love his rants. I've I've tweeted a few of them out and said, like, Bravo. I tweeted him out.  It paid me to make a video where he was getting gangbanged, really hurt, hurt me. I didn't want to do it.  It should be so funny, man. It's so funny. And this is coming from a guy who's a fan of Bill Maher. I was laughing hard.  I, I love that you showed your wife and she was like, what's wrong with.  There is a comedy is, you know, different tastes, different strokes, but, yeah, it is, but it's also like, come on man, if you lighten up, it's almost all funny.  I mean, there's some fart videos, I think fart videos, and there's a place for them. I don't think there's a place for it. But some people don't like them. And I hear about it.  This is a place for them. Yeah. Yeah. A good fart is one of the funniest that that movie Norbit with Eddie Murphy never saw. I saw it two nights ago. It was amazing. He plays three people in the movie like I didn't see it. I think it came out in 2007. I didn't see it do their song Sorbent Norbit. Yeah, OK. Eddie Murphy plays like a nerd character. He plays the nerds wife and then he plays this guy who is orphanage's.  He plays a Chinese guy. Dude, it is amazing. It's so funny. The funny parts, the moment where he hits the big laughs, he's like, holy shit, that's him and him. Yeah. So that's Eddie playing the wife, this enormous woman who rescues him from a sandbox spoiler alert when he's a little kid and basically kidnaps him, makes it become her husband.  And she has her one of her brothers, Terry Crews and the other brothers. Attitudes are built just like Terry Crews, just big fucking giant dudes, just super jacked. And they're all like trying to run some scam on this lady. And Norbit has to fucking step in and save the day. Dude, I'm telling you, can we get the. It's so silly. It's so fun. Like, I laughed so hard at this movie.  I saw these kind of movies that I want to watch now that are just so silly me away from it. Can we get the rotten tomatoes on that?  It's probably like three percent did. They could suck my dick. That's a great movie. It's a funny movie. What does Rotten Tomatoes say? Nine nine. Wait a minute.  Yeah, they robbed you to trust me.  They're wrong. They're wrong. Sacrifice the sacred plant to the hour, to the fire gods and watch.  Nor does it get a nine. Thou do assholes bunch of assholes in the world.  They hate life. It's fucking great. When I said, listen, I know it's funny. I laughed hard at that movie.  I laughed hard. They just were looking for it to be something else. I mean, the movie was basically like absurdist, like it was really funny.  Man and Eddie Eddie Murphy played this racist Chinese guy who would say racist shit, oh, that's him right there.  But it's him saying it. It's not a Chinese guy for so and it's in twenty seven. So it flies because he probably couldn't even Eddie probably couldn't even get away with doing that today. Like people would get so upset if they didn't realize it was Eddie saying that to Eddie. Do you think we'll ever get back to a point where we already brought this up, like you think we can do some other culture and you can do Italians and you can do this, but you can make fun of Italians, Irish people, English people.  You just can't make fun of anybody that we decide is disenfranchised or recent immigrants, let's say, flips, flips, and then like Asians are like running America.  Right.  Can there be comedy where a white guy does an Asian? There can be that right now.  Nobody cares. I think they do. I think you can't do that.  Listen, man, a black guy can do white face with zero problems. Yeah. It's because there was never an Al Jolson for white people.  Right? Is that what it is? Probably part man fucking dancin with the white gloves on.  It is that it's bad on top of everything else. What?  I would pay a thousand dollars for an Oculus game that puts you and me in the front row. We both put the headphones on just to be uncomfortable apple boxes. And we watch a minstrel show that's in a tent in the middle of Kansas in the early nineteen hundreds when you're like, oh my gosh, I just kill myself. Like, if you know how this thing turns out, that's one of the last places if I go through time or one I close things on would be I could just be really uncomfortable.  Do Dorothy was happy.  She got picked up by a goddamn tornado. She was happy. Yeah. Brought to Land of Oz. I get to see all kinds of she's got ruby slippers. Oh that.  Her paw like here about like the munchkins are molesting her. She's getting like the real Miotto. Yeah. There she is.  That's her. Judy Garland in blackface. Oh my God. That's crazy. Normal things.  She went blackface with buckwheat hair. She double it.  It just. That's crazy. Wow. But that was a normal thing. It's like they decided that I guess they decided that. They wanted to put black people in films without putting actual black people in films and making them famous, so they said we've got to work around here, he said, to make white people, black people. And everyone's going to know, like, did they know what Al Jolson looked like in real life or was it like kiss in the 70s?  I had a I have a problem with kids because I never met in college who loved Kiss, and he would he had a girlfriend in our little tiny dorm room.  And they so it's like a college where it's zero degrees out. You have the windows open, have to get up because they'd be breathing frost and he would bang this girl and he just loved kids and he'd take triple acid, go out and stare at the sun and come back.  And then one day he rearranged our furniture. So I come home in. The doorman opened and he put the refrigerator from the door and he's like, I rearranged the apartment.  I'm like, you can't put the we can't open the door. He was just so high.  Anyway, I associate kids with him and say, I'll never I'll never like this boy. That guy can sell though, Jean. Oh, he sells. He sells.  Possibly kissing his ass off to. And there's some great fuckin songs that some great songs. Come on and love me, you ever hear that song was I wish I could play for you get pulled off. I need to. I know that. What can I do? That's a great song. It's a good song.  I want to rock and roll all night already. Every day. I don't like that song.  Down, down, down, down. That bad. I guess I want I got I have too much kiss drama.  You got to let it go man. It's a great band. I had the total opposite. My uncle was an artist for the very talent company. They are the advertising company that did their album covers. Oh, so those are great. Yeah.  My uncle worked in the place kind of trying to remember the name of this is Paul Stanley right here. Gene Simmons son. Old school branding was so good.  This is like kids live two days. I know what the fuck this is, son. You know what the fuck's going on.  This is great. This is the great fucking music meant for me. It just locks me into that time.  So you can't show it because then they'll charge you a royalty to life. Dude, we had Gary Clark Jr. did a cover of Midnight Rider cover of it and we played the color no longer charge you for.  They took that. They they just take your fuckin money. That's ours.  I can not own the song. Yeah. Even a cover, which, by the way, he needs to release the he needs a release that I need. If I do anything before I die, I need to talk. Honey, honey and Gary Clark Jr. into doing another version of midnight. Got to be here before you die.  Have you ever heard it. Can I play it for you to play it for him. Let him take the money.  These fucks, these fucking thieves, you fuck the one that they did on the Instagram.  Yeah, they it's just it's so distinctive. So good, but they fucking they have like YouTube, copyright claims and all kinds of stuff, like you can't show parts of films, if it was up to me, I would start off every podcast with Clint Eastwood talking to the Comanches. These are my words of life and also my words of death. These are my words. Ever see that in The Outlaw Josey?  Well, so this is them. This is a small club in downtown and there's probably like one.  Sorry, who is this? That's my friend Suzanne Santo and Ben Jaffe. They're a band called Honey, Honey. And that motherfucker behind the guitar is one of the baddest to ever do it. That's Gary Clark Jr..  It's I just thought about being how long it's been since I've been in a club of any kind. I know, right?  I'm doing Houston next weekend. Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. I'm doing the improv. Do they give you any, I don't know, restriction.  Amount of people don't spit in people's mouths. That was your big closer. That's how I was going to end. No, man, just go have some fun.  They don't have like a restriction on the number of people in the room or the 75 percent capacity or the they trimmed it down only 25 percent. Just take care of yourself, folks. Get your vitamins in. That's the thing. Take your vitamin D, wear a fucking mask.  Do what you got to do is that you're the D is the important one is huge. Huge. It's huge for a lot of things. It's huge for muscle development, huge brain function. It's a hormone apparently as well. According to Dr. Rhonda Patrick. She's always been on my podcast before. She was explaining that all these people that were in the intensive care unit with covid, a giant percentage of them, like more than 80 percent of them in one study, had inat insufficient levels of vitamin D and only four percent had sufficient levels.  And so then she told me that 70 percent of the United States is deficient in vitamin D, 70 percent not in the sun as much. Exactly.  And only 29 percent have sufficient vitamin D, which is just like bonkers. Only twenty nine percent. Oh, no, no, no, no. Excuse me, 29 percent.  What was it I want to say had insufficient, not 20? I'm fucking the numbers up, but there was a very small number of people, like if it was 70 percent or deficient, there was a certain number of people that had insufficient levels to the point where they were vulnerable, their immune system was vulnerable and they could get more disease. There was a large number of fucking up the number, though.  I'm always low on day. Every time you don't go outside, man, if you don't go outside and you don't take it, you're not going to get it. Yeah, I do take it. But they're what they're discovering is there's like a whole there's a lot of things that have to interact together in your body to keep you healthy. You know, you have to have electrolytes. You have to have amino acids, you have to have vitamins. You have to have all these things.  And when one of them is missing and one of them is severely missing and a really important one like vitamin D, the whole thing gets thrown into whack and you get vulnerable. And that's part of what we're showing here. There's a there's a metabolic vulnerability that a lot of people have. And it's not just that the virus is scary, but it's also that people have really fucked up immune systems because they're not healthy, because they're not getting enough vitamins.  And then when you find all these athletes that catch this disease and shake it off like it's nothing, you got to go. OK, we were talking yesterday about these NBA players that got it. No symptoms. They just got it. Yeah, and they're fine. All right. I know a bunch of people that have got it like that. Like, man, I don't know. I think this this is showing vulnerability and people's immune systems more than anything.  We should be really concerned about that. On top of being concerned about spreading the disease. God damn. We've got to spread information on how to strengthen your immune system.  Yeah, I mean, that vitamin D, but a good tip. It's a good tip, but it's only the tip of the iceberg.  The water is important.  Drink a lot of water, stay hydrated, have a lot of electrolytes, have vitamins, all the whiskey pot, make sure you get high at least once a day so you can sleep good and be scared all the time.  There's a lot of shit going on, man, but we only hear in one side.  Yeah, I. I'm another doctor in a while, knock on wood, I feel pretty healthy. I used to I was diagnosed with celiac disease.  I'm going to be in the doctor after Bill Maher finds you. Should I be scared of him? I should be. He might share with you what would. Bill Maher. It's funny.  Why don't you might check with cocaine. OK, Rachel, here comes cocaine into your car, ok. You fuck. It's so good.  That's such a good impression. Anyone says it's not a good impression. Come on man. I mean, I do a lot of impressions. They're not all good.  I some are like pretty. I think my ilan's pretty weak, but my bill is pretty good.  Your bill's pretty good. It's very good. He just shit on me. You Caitlyn Jenner is her voice everywhere. That's her voice now and see her speak any other way. She knows those noises when she does that because she's I think she's a loner.  Like she answers herself, you know, she'll be like, hey, you got some huge map. And she's going, yeah, I don't know.  I bottom Jimmy Choo me and I'm. Yeah.  How weird. Where's Cam? Anybody who thinks that that's a superficial aspect of our culture today, you're right on that Bruce Jenner is now Caitlyn Jenner on some big deal like that, that the weirdness of it not saying that she shouldn't be able to do that. She absolutely should. But the weirdness of that sort of defines like how crazy life is today. It's almost like you're seeing these little hints when you're getting close to the end of the game. The narrative is falling apart.  The fucking plot gets weirder and weirder. You're like, oh, my God, when is the big reveal his Olympic?  And then at the end of it, aliens. Yeah, yeah.  Well, you watch that new now there's a new footage or simulation of the car crash, really that thought the lady stopped in front of him.  But her it was him was Bruce at the time.  But it looks like now that she just plowed right through these two people and pushed them right into traffic and died when I'm done.  Yeah.  And I don't know this simulations. Right.  But the one I saw in the new theory is that, like, she was on her phone, not that they know what she was doing with the lady in front of her, didn't slam on the brakes. It was like they were coming to us. They were slowing down for a light.  But we tell you how progressive I feel saying she. Yeah, I keep saying she she she says you are you're a hero. I think she was bruised back then.  Yeah, she was briss. So what do you say about that. Yeah.  Bruce did it. God that Bruce can't drive anyway. Woman of the year.  Maybe that's what happened. Woman of the year after that. Yeah. Yeah, right. Pretty soon. Pretty weird.  Weird family. Feel that. Not good. Their mom died and then they're like, oh, the speech of the Woman of the Year. Oh yeah. My mom pretty upset about that.  Yeah.  I mean, I don't want I don't know what the accent was exactly, but it, it looks like pretty bad but weird how rarely it's discussed. That's what's weird.  Well it came at such a time where you were transphobia if you said anything about her, about so it was like the perfect timing for murder.  It was a murder for someone getting away with it. Yeah. Yeah. Everybody was so enthralled with the idea that she was beautiful and like there was things around to say. Yeah, yeah. Beautiful hero, brave.  And I'm like, hey, hey. And also that was Bruce.  And it was like you couldn't even say really comfortably Bruce anymore. And so Caitlyn didn't do it. Caitlyn didn't do it.  Yeah. Like she dodged the bullet.  Perfect timing. You're going to read someone into a Hummer across traffic.  That's a good sign. I wonder if that was what pushed her to come out. You know what, Kim? Let's assume let's stop before that.  She definitely which is talking long hair and we're making up or just maybe we don't know, you must be homophobic or trans phobic, but that that may have hurried things up. It might have been the catalyst. I would have. Yeah. I'll tell you, if I did that and I was transgender, I'd bump up that appointment.  Imagine if there is like a PR guy and he's like, I got a plan.  Well, I mean, anybody hey, everyone in your family with a vagina is making a lot of money. You're doing terrible damage on who's going to fuck you now. Anyway, right now, let's get this party started.  All right. Let's keep that action hush hush. We're getting my garden. You know, it's funny about, you know, she's seen it.  Seen what? Oh, I know.  Khloe made a video where she was like, we're mad at. Yeah, she she kept doing that. I didn't say my Larry.  I have a video where they just all say, like, that's hilarious.  I think, look, they got they must have a good sense of humor. They've been taking abuse for more than a decade now.  Yeah, I, I think mine's so cartoonish.  Yeah, I know. When you make them make the noises.  Oh. Thinking young they're doing.  Oh my two girls actually quote. I saw somebody on Twitter that actually said stop calling people Karens. It's misogynistic and it's just a convenient way of you saying bitch.  Really, this is a very you can't people just can't stop, they can't stop correcting people. No, they can't stop telling people what to do, they can't stop their life is a fucking mess and they can't stop correcting other people. It's got to feel good. You've got to get some charge out of us.  You're mad. You can't call people. Karen, I know a lot of parents and they're really nice people, so fuck off.  Yeah, Karens are great. The haircut I love, they'll angled haircut, but there's like women.  Their name is Karen. It's nothing wrong with that.  Oh yeah. Actual Karens. But if you complain it's going to, it's just going to stick around.  Someone saying don't call women Karen because it is a Karen.  Oh that's so dumb. You're so silly. Like you should be laughing and all this. This is not if your name is Karen.  Well I could get why you're upset for all these years you skated by then for fucking whatever reason, Karen became the complaining white lady.  Do you know how was it first to Karen was patient zero. Karen No idea. Maybe, maybe.  Great name for it. It's a perfect name. Maybe that's why it just seems perfect. Yeah. Who else would it be?  Oh, Karen's calling Helen and maybe a Helen hell is too old, right?  Helen's mean Kaitlyn's to our Catherine Katelyn's owned by Caitlyn Jenner forever.  No kids calling their daughter Caitlyn. Now, it's like just too risky.  Yeah, Caitlyn. Caitlyn is it's like you can't call your kid Madonna. Right. Right. You can't call you kid Caitlyn.  Either parent should have called her, but I don't think they did. Oh, she made I think she her last name is a cushiony or something like that. I think she had a real name at one point in time.  I know she's falling.  She's, I don't know, trying to be nice now. I'm just like I don't have enough information with anything said I. I'm starving myself.  I hear rumors and I let people.  Yeah, that's a good move. Just spread the word. Let the information. It's not stopping anybody else. No, it's not. It doesn't matter. Even with all this information that's available, why should I look something out. Yeah, why should you. These fucks want you do what? They don't even do their bidding. There is a lot of conversations.  I don't even know that's. Where were they? You think you're having a conversation with somebody, but really they're just checking if you agree with every single thing they're saying.  And then you get this venom if you diverge from it's really weird, but I've had a few pumpkins with so that if you diverge from their ideology at all, they get them.  Yeah, yeah. I mean, the rage that comes up surprised me a couple of times, like a cult feeling of you're saying they're wrong.  I don't know. What were the subjects.  I mean Black Lives Matter. I mean I, you know, my brother's a cop and so it's like I have a little.  Well you are in a position like you agree, I think, with a lot of reasonable people that what that guy did was horrific.  One hundred percent murder, murder, awful and good. Put him in jail forever.  And there's definitely racism.  And it's something definitely that we well, there's also a personal issue with that guy and the cop apparently, you know about that they work fairly, worked together. And then they had words. They. Oh, yeah. Because the cop was apparently very aggressive towards customers. Yeah. And they they got angry at each other over.  So this is a personal thing, you know, a lot of ways. Yeah. But that said, defunding the police is crazy.  That's very dumb idea. I mean, they're underfunded. Yeah. It's also the job. I just know it just so hard. You imagine going to where people are being assholes every day, all day for decades.  And you just it's just a they would never do this.  But I think part of reform should be meditation. I mean, they would never do this. But if you wake up and then you put a bulletproof vest on, you go to work, you save your family.  It's a it's a really mentally anguishing.  And this is not to say there's no reason not to deal with.  I think it's great what's happening, but it's just I don't I personally get when the pendulum is, you know, falling too hard the other way against police when the vast majority and my brother just like a really nice, emotionally intelligent guy who's just, you know, suddenly getting spit on and stuff, it's just like doesn't feel good.  But I think people are being very shortsighted. What is it that you need? The police. You need the police. You just need to better train police, you know? Yeah.  If I mean, if the other side didn't have guns, I'd be like, OK, I'd take away their guns.  But even then, man, you're going to have bigger, stronger people taking your shit because you don't have guns. Yes. And it's not none of it is good. You need a police. You just need the police need to be better funded. They need to be better trained. And they they, like all of us, need to get better. I think the police of today are probably way better than the police are fifty years ago. But that's still we see what some of them have done to peaceful protesters while letting looters get away with it.  It's like this is the system's broken.  It's there's no way it's not broken. It's a huge mess.  And hopefully, like you said, it'll it'll get ironed out and stuff. Well, Minneapolis is going to be an interesting case study because if they do defend their police, I don't I don't know what they're going to. Lace it with or how they're going to redo it. I hope they redo it with more money, but it doesn't seem like they're going to they should pay people more money because it's a fucking horrifically dangerous job and they should train people much better and they should train people more often than that.  I mean, because if you don't get into a situation and often I mean, you know, from jiujitsu, probably you need to keep training to be calm.  All these cops and all the mistakes happen because they're freaked out. Your adrenaline is running bad decision. And they don't they don't have any confidence in handling themselves. And also, when they're in a physical confrontation with some guy who's been thinking about punching them for the last three minutes. Yeah. The guy's thinking, when should I punch this cop once that punches cop night? No, sir. No, sir. I didn't think I was going fast. He's saying I'm going to punch this motherfucker.  I'm just waiting for my time. And then boom. Also, you're in a physical confrontation.  You don't know what to do if you get hit first. Yeah, you're in trouble. And also there's a gun in and the cop has a gun. Yeah.  Once you're wrestling, cops never know when to pull their gun. And then there's also sociopaths. Are you guys who are cops, they're sociopaths. They can't wait to kill people. They can't wait to shoot people. Yeah. They want to thrill they don't feel anything in regular life. They want to be able to kill somebody and blame it on, you know, this person's a criminal or whatever. There's there are real people that want to shoot people.  I mean, that's that's a part of life, too. And we've seen videos, man, seen videos of people shooting people and cops shooting people for no fucking reason. It's horrific. And I think it's just a symptom of the job, man, because it's it's a it's happening all over the place. It's happening whenever it seems like whenever cops get ramped up and they have, you know, a lot of power and they're holding a gun, there's a person in front of them and there's some sort of a dispute and they're yelling, get on the fucking ground.  Like that guy might get shot. Yeah, that guy might get shot.  Whether that guy's Asian or European or black, he's going to get shot by the right guy in the right situation. And that's what the statistics show. Statistics show that although there are these horrific cases like that George Floyd case, when you get to watch it, there's less of those than there were in like 2015. There's less doesn't mean it's good, but there's less. Black men are killed by cops now than there was before.  But one is too many, you know. And when you when you see that part of what you're seeing is not just racism. You're also seeing just the abuse that comes when someone has that kind of power over people.  And there are a simple minded fuckhead and you've given them the kind of power that a cop has.  Yeah, some there's some bad, bad fucking people, man.  There's there's bad people that do every job and bad people that are construction workers. Bad people that are cops.  It's Yeah. Then the problem is when they fuck up, it's so public and it's such a big deal because they have so much more power. Right. Their position is so crazy. The guy who has a gun who's literally telling you, get on the fucking ground, you have to listen to him. Yeah. No other time in life. You have to listen to a man tell you to get on the ground. This guy is actually working for you.  He's working with your tax dollars. You pay for the police. Yeah. Like, this is crazy. This guy's about to shoot me and I pay him. Yeah. You know, it's weird, you know, because if it was a regular guy telling you get on the ground, like why? You know, because I smell we like, fuck you. Like you're just a regular guy. But because he's a cop, even though he's still a regular guy, he has all this power to tell you what to do.  It's it's fucking very strange.  It's just being a cop psychologically. It's very strange.  There's a lot of layers and what strong people to do that job, that's what you need to pay them.  Well, it's just like who now is going to be like, I want to be a cop when I grow up.  I mean, somebody needs to come forth and say that some governor needs to say that an eloquent way like you guys are looking at this wrong. We need better people. We need to put more money into the community, more money into the police force, more more money into training these fucking people. We need to make everybody safer. The way to make people safer is not have less cops and less funding and still have better cops, better paid cops, maybe even more cops and more funding and make sure that they never fucking do that, never in any abuse at all.  You instantly get rid of them. Any abuse at all. Everyone's wearing a body camera, no exceptions. Every altercation gets reviewed, any abuse gets reported. And you can't do that, man. And if you don't know how to handle someone without getting abusive, then you're doing an effective and ineffective version of that job. And you're probably dangerous to other cops because you're going to leave it in that person's head that cops are assholes. Cops treat you like shit.  Cops hate you. Whenever a cop does that for no reason, he doesn't just fuck over that person. He fucks over all the people who watch that video, all the people who get mad at cops. And that's what you're seeing today. You're seeing this probably even though it's less things are happening to folks because of bad cops, more people are seeing it than ever before. Yeah.  So our idea of what a cop is is just way out of whack right now.  Yeah, that town in Seattle, what happened there? There was no police and they just took over.  It's a festival. I don't understand the fun. I don't understand how they were like, I guess, scram.  The cops were like, I can't go. They don't want me in there. I mean, I don't know how that's going to play out, I'm sure good. I'm sure that Chad it's called the Chaz, is that right?  Yeah. Yeah. Autonomous zone, Capitol Hill Autonomous Zone called Chaz.  How did they get sick? Leave cops and the cops left. Like, what was that moment?  Well, if I had to guess, it's because there's not enough cops and not well funded weren't prepared for this bad government. Bunch of people that are anarchists, all organized, got together, did something chaotic. Business owners fled, people panicked. They gave up power to these folks. They were espousing an ideology that on paper at least seems sort of admirable, given power of the people, you know, getting rid of corruption, getting rid of some of the bad aspects of capitalism.  This is like there's all sorts of parts of it that sold people on the idea. But it's not good. They don't only in those buildings, they didn't build them. They can't just take them. You shouldn't because that's piracy. You give someone just comes into your neighborhood and takes your fucking house. That's piracy, pirate. You can't just let these people take over this blog. It's the people's man. We don't allow money. OK, well, you don't have a lot of money, but you can't stop other people from using money.  Fuck. Just like we don't stop you from trading with tomatoes. If you want to fucking try, I'll give you three tomatoes. If you give me that camera, I'm like, OK, good deal. Well you're allowed to do that. Yeah, OK. But you're not allowed to tell people they can't use money so that they have like a whole zone where there's no money like a come on man, that's just step one to fascism.  You got to going to make your own fascism. And then there was a video I saw of this one guy was filming something. So these other guys came over and beat the shit out of them. I'm like, oh, great. So then you treat one of your own the same way cops treat you like this happen. I mean, congratulations and your revenge, you're going to make up police. They won't call it that.  But of course, there's going to be people that patrol just like you remember the Guardian Angels. Yeah. Yeah. Since I was in traffic once and there's this guardian angel and this dude is like Dowi, like a little baby arms, a little gupte.  I'm like, this is crazy. This guy is protecting anybody from anything. I'm looking at him with my friend. Like you look at this motherfucker and he looks to me, goes. Double fingers, double fingers just stared in the windshield, we didn't even say anything, we didn't say like, hey, man, what the fuck are you guarding, bro? He didn't say anything like that. We just looked at him. I was like, look at this motherfucker.  Look at this guy right here. That's the guardian angel. He's out. He's out there protecting people. And he gave you that little bird. You give me the double bird with an angry face.  I was like, oh, you shouldn't have that job. You shouldn't be standing in the middle of cars patrolling. Like, what are you patrolling? Where is this? In New York. New York City. Yeah.  And then the main guy was on a radio show and there was some sort of a scandal. We're lucky. He said he stopped some sort of a crime that didn't really exist. I think I remember that when we were there, I saw him on TV like still on the local news there.  He still is. But wasn't there some. That's right. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. That's him. Yeah. So it's real weird, they have the T-shirt on and the berets, they'd walk down the street and do that like that one dude has like the chainmail he's got. Kiss brings right back to kiss Gene Simmons wrist straps.  Oh. That's cool idea. It's preposterous. No. What about, like, just their presence, making people think twice about crime if you see a.  Oh, yeah, no, I hear you. And I'm saying that all the superheroes in Seattle walking around a couple of years ago. Right.  But that's different. Those guys actually knew how to fight. That was we talked about that.  That was not all of them, I would say.  I don't know how many of we're actually trying to stop crime. These guys are actually trying to stop. Crime was very strange. It was like organized vigilantes, unarmed organized vigilantes. They had no power to do anything the right thing.  Well, they could beat your ass because that sucks. And the guy gave me the double figures was like, hmm, I just think you might be a little bit jumping the gun here.  Imagine if a cop did that. If you saw a cop in traffic with this fucking guy was stupid.  Blue outfit is like he took to he'd be like, oh, my God, that guy shouldn't be a cop.  Right. So why should this guy be a guardian angel? I think we should vet if that existed, we should let them, but they disbanded.  Yes, luckily, yeah, they fell apart, but that's probably what's going to happen.  And a lot of these that police free zones, you're going to have weirdos who want to be fake cops wearing berets, wandering around, giving people the finger, and that's in their code of what to do.  There's a lot of people out there that don't understand the importance of the police. You're fucking up, man. You're fucking it up for everybody else, too. Who are you going to call when someone breaks in your house? If there's no one to call, there's going to be more people breaking into your house.  Oh, yeah. If they take away the guns from cops, I mean, like bank robberies will be successful one hundred percent of the time.  One hundred percent call what's going to stop you from robbing jewelry stores every day. No. AK 47.  It's so dumb. It's so dumb. Like you. This should be something where it gets argued, where there's a meeting, where you show all the interactions that the police have had with with the community, all the interactions, every single one of them gets detailed and documented. And then you say, well, how many of these were negative? And you look at it, if there was like three or four, like really strongly negative ones, what about all the positive ones?  What about all the people that were protected? What about all the robberies that were stopped? Would have been all the all the crimes that were prevented. What about all the people that were arrested that were murderers and rapists and all that? Are you going to do that now or are we just going to pretend that shit doesn't exist? Because there's all these interactions that the cops have and there's some of them that are negative? You're right. It's not no one's saying that's not true.  Maybe there's to throw it all out. Like if you were arguing that, like from data, from a data perspective, if you were in a meeting and they're like, look, we have these these are the bad interactions. And these all these papers are the good interactions, like, OK, well, rationally, we need to stop that from happening. How do we do that? How do we how do we eliminate or at least radically reduce the number of bad interactions you'd work on that you wouldn't say defund the police?  That's like a fucking vertue gesture. Like, look at me, we're going to defend we're going to just plant flowers.  Yeah, I might be ignorant, but I feel like it's called that to cause controversy. So gets attention. I mean, they said reform the police. Maybe I'm ignorant and they really mean to defund it.  It just seems Minneapolis said defund specifically. Maybe they're going to they're going to if they give cops the same before other jobs, then they're going to have dudes with clubs with nails hanging out of them. It's going to be dudes with baseball bats wrapped in chain mail like that.  Degan dude from Degan. Yeah, from Walking Dead. What's his name? Negin. Negin. That's his name. Right. The mean guy kills people with a baseball bat. Yeah.  Fuck that guy. Right. That guy's going to be everywhere. That guy has been in control in Van Nuys. Yeah. People like that. Everywhere you look, you know, I get a gun.  That's another thing. If you take away guns from cops, then everyone has to buy a gun.  Exactly. Dude, it's terrible. You can't do this. This is such a dumb idea. And also, you can't do it in a city where that thing didn't happen either. It's not even the same people. You're one guy was a horrible person and then another guy was a horrible person in Atlanta. But there's a million cops like you can't I don't know how many there are.  It's probably close to a million. And exactly. Yet there are a lot of fucking cops, man. Yet there's hundreds of thousands of interactions that are not good that that are happening all the time, especially with the protests and stuff. There's a lot of interaction.  And look, I think everybody got the message, I think, to this George Floyd thing. Everybody got the message and the people that are going to flare up that are still behaving the same way, like that guy who shot that guy in Atlanta. They get charged with murder man right away. Right away. Right away. Felony murder. You get the death penalty, that guy.  And he probably should. He probably showed the way he shot that guy. If he really knew that that guy had a Taser, that didn't even work. Yeah, it's murder. It's what's crazy is if you watch the video, the guy's compliant. I know him for 20 minutes. Like, can you just pull over? They don't do paperwork. They're like, can you just.  Yeah, he's compliant and he wants he just wants them to get an Uber. Right. Isn't that what he said? Did he say something along those lines or the way they should have done that? There should be a way that you could ticket someone, maybe even take their license away. But like. Get them home, don't fuck and put them in a cage like they did something stupid and they shouldn't be allowed to drive. They should definitely pay a fine.  They should definitely get in trouble for driving intoxicated, for sure. But do you really need to be violent with them and lock them in a cage? I don't know if that's the case and not in that guy's case. The way that guy was interacting with a cop, it seems like he just was fucked up and just wanted to go. And suddenly it just went. Yeah, because that's what we're talking about before. Like when a cop has to worry, when he's talking to a guy, the guy could be like super kind and just thinking about punching him in the face.  Like, if I was in a situation like in a movie, like a Bourne Identity movie and there was a cop that was interrogating me and he was saying something to me and he kept closing in on me, I'm like, oh, my God, I'm I have to knock this cop out, OK? I don't want him to know I'm going to hit him. So I'm just going to be really compliant. That's what I would do. Yeah, I would go.  Well, sir, I definitely didn't know that that was happening. No, sir.  Yeah, well, in the pain I saw know where you got to be able to do it. Whether or not they don't know you're going to do it.  I tell you exactly like that. Last night this guy was just being really cool. And the cops I can just check, you know, search a little bit.  He's again and his dead, they don't show the actual last moments.  But, yeah, that's how it goes down, man. They can easily go down like that where someone could pretend. They'll pretend they're being nice to you and then they'll shoot you and the cops watch these, they make them watch them say like this could happen. But you know what's fucked up, dude? I was reading about the Comanches doing that to settlers, to the people have always done that. Yeah, everything's fine. Everything's fine. And they fuck them up.  It's like an old trick. Yeah.  Like I was reading this horrible story about or listening to this horrible story about these Comanches that came into these people's houses. And they came in. They just wanted their food. They said, let me have food. And then people fed them. And then after they ate, they said, go now, no hurt, go vamoosed, don't hurt like they forced the people out of their own house. Yeah. And the people just didn't know what to do.  They just like what's wrong? They just started running Crossfield. They got about a half a mile. The Comanches found them. And the one lady who was pregnant, they cut the top of her head off, like in the sculptor from the ears up.  So they literally cut all while she was alive, cut all the skin from her ears all the way to the remove the top skin of her skull. They cut it off and took it with them. And they shot her full of arrows. And she survived for a couple of days and gave birth to a stillborn baby. No. Oh, this is this is what people were capable of in 1840. Right. So just that's where the same thing is.  Those people were the same thing. And when shit goes fucking completely sideways, I was watching this thing in New Mexico where this one kid hit this guy with a skateboard and then pulled a knife out on the guy. And the guy reaches out of his fucking pants and pulls a gun and shoots the dude down. And I'm like, oh, my God. Like this is that one of those like take down a statue, rallies? Yeah. It's like, fuck, people are losing their mind.  I mean, it's not that kind of horrific. Violence is not that far removed from that shit that was going on with the the settlers in the Plains Indians. It's not that far removed, man. It's like you're only a couple incidents away. Nobody thought we'd be seeing that on a regular basis. People having gunfights on the street, a dude getting attacked by anti funny fucking lights come up with a nine millimeter and drop some, like everyone screaming, who the fuck?  When when did you ever see that? That's pretty rare. Now there's like a new video every couple of days of something crazy happening.  Well, now that we've cheered everyone up, I think I've been hilarious the past hour. You were really very good. The entire three course we've didn't. We've been here three hours. Three told my guys three twenty. Relax. Yeah.  Anyway, sorry, Jamie. Come on. They go home. It's awesome. This is really fun and it's always awesome. Thank you. And I want to take this home. You take that home, you can have another one. You want another one. Yeah, I do.  Freshie we actually have we give away bags because here in California this one good thing, marijuana is legal. It's one of the only good things.  Yeah. It's worked out. Yes. Oh yeah. They looked at the crime rates since that shows you how fucked up our government is. They can't balance the economy even with all that weed money.  Is it helping at all. Yeah, it's helping them get rich. All that weed money. Think about how much more money is pumped into the economy and these fucking twats can't manage it. Yeah. Let's go to that town, which one, Seattle? Oh, Chaz, Chaz Bono, Chaz, hang out. Yeah, sure.
