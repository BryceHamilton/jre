 Fantastic. Now, the Joe Rogan experience, joined by Joe Rogan podcast by Night All Day. So, OK, it's working. We had some technical difficulties, ladies and gentlemen, songa Don Cheadle, Vera Yadong, we were talking about as an alpha male guy and it seemed like there was the might have been a visa issue and then they cleared it up just in time. But Uriah Faber apparently weighed in yesterday.  That would have been fun. But I already I've read I might be wrong.  Jamie, see if we could find this out.  OK, I think up the clock, I think they were saying that it was going to be a lightweight fight like Urijah is like if you were I was going to agree is like, okay, look, I weigh like 165. I'll get down to 55. That's fair.  Yeah. And she throws down either way. I don't know.  See, I saw it when I was running out of the house that it was an issue. But then that song You Dong's Visa Problems came through. I call this last fight.  I believe he's wicked. First on his hands are very good. It's hard to. Yeah, it's real hard. He's female for me.  I'm trying to think he's still there because he got of the left. Yeah. Garbanzos gone gun.  Marvin Marlen's very dangerous and he's creative.  He'll do wild shit like Cheetah will set you up with stuff and he takes big chances like you throw a fly in neon you.  He's a very, very game dude and really smart.  Yes. Yeah. And I mean, look how smart he is defensively here. He's he's just staying on the outside. He knows this guy's super dangerous using his kicks.  He's a lot of head kicks and he's putting pressure on them and putting on hard kicks. A lot of pressure on him, but he was doing it from a kicking range to write Yadong like real good hands, he's real dangerous and tight like this.  OK, what are you looking up for, Urijah? The question was, was Urijah Faber willing to step in for Songa dying because of a visa issue, and was it going to be a lightweight at one fifty five?  And I thought, I'm pretty sure I read that, but I was half assing my reading.  You're skimming through this. That's what I do. Sometimes I'm just busy. I look at the picture right there. Sorry.  I know that's why everyone is so uninformed, me included. We're barely paying attention.  There's too much to be done to throw it out like it's facts. Yes. OK, Brian Faber made a surprise appearance at the Wains today, he weighed in at one fifty three point five. The reason he did so is because Sonia Dawngate won forty five point five was a potential visa issue that may preclude him from filing tomorrow. This is from Ariel Quantize Twitter page and it says all trying to sort it out. Two main questions are right now. Can the issue be sorted out in time for the event?  If not, would the commission allow Faber to fight Vera, who waited at one forty five point five oh, and he weighed eight pounds heavier?  I don't think, well, fucking Florida, so it doesn't matter now. The fight on it is only eight pounds, isn't it?  Like, that's a big difference right there.  Yes, but what do they usually say in terms of like what I thought was after six they I thought it was. That makes sense. It's such a big difference. Right? God, it's such a spooky part of the sport. The way. Yeah. To be arrested next to Kumara Uzma. I'm like, how the fuck do you weigh one hundred and seventy pounds ever.  Well do you think of wounds that you see two 49 that you commentated Caillat and Steven Stevens, you know, missed weight by five pounds. I think he was like, we're not going to make it any balloons the fuck up. The kid was like, all right, I guess we'll do it, man. Yeah.  You know, that was a real weird one, right? Because that's not normal for Jeremy Stevens. He's miswired a couple of times. But, you know, that's a lot of weight to miss by, you know, that's real unusual.  When it's that big, I assume they're in there like, dude, you're not going to make it. And he's like, fuck it, miss it by, you know, a point. Five pounds misses by five. I'm a quick killing myself.  So there's something to fight for, you know, God, it's so crazy that the twenty four hours before a cage fight, they almost kill themselves in the sauna.  Not I like it when you guys were talking about that one heavyweight and he kicked out the two or five and he goes, but it's so, so right.  Everyone says that, oh dude, you got eighty five. You should be a seventy and C's like motherfuckers.  Let me tell you something right now, for every dude who did it, like the rich franklyn's, he was like one of the first guys to be around Rich Franklin. You go rich. How the fuck are you. One hundred and eighty five pounds ever.  He's a big guy or force Griffin. I remember Facebook. I mean him. We're doing PR together in Brazil. And I was like, what do you weigh right now? He's like, I'm like forty seven like you way more than we do. I'm we as crazy. Right.  Fuck the the, the, the guys who are really young and really strong, they can get away with that if they do it right.  But it pays a little bit more of a price I think every time you do it towards the end.  This is the thought about Tony in the fight that, like I was saying, is pretty gangster. He decided to make weight anyway.  But then people that, you know, like Dana said, there's a couple other people said it's like, why would you do that?  Doesn't when you know you're going to have to make money.  I talked to Tony yesterday and he said has had nothing to do with the way I'm sure Lance had nothing to do with the way I'm sure he you know, look, he fought well, but he had to have felt something from draining his body just a couple of weeks ago.  You know, we know where you are. I don't mean to interrupt you, but I know it didn't help. Right. Right. We know that exactly. We help him.  Justin, just fight an awesome fight.  Yeah, that's true. That's true, too, because this and the things like Tony took an inhuman amount of punishment, but his his cardio is so much better than everyone else's.  Even when you get to a ridiculous extent, you everyone knows, like, you know better than anybody how hard it is to breathe when you're getting hurt. If you're getting hurt and you're stunned, that's when your cardio goes out the window through the shitter.  People when you get when you get clipped that drain your energy more than anything, your car goes through the window, this car to you and everyone away. He's fine.  He's already training. He's training today. He was dancing in the fucking dancing in the emergency room. He's ready to go back.  He's taking this loss like it gave me the chills listening to him talk last night.  Yeah, we're talking to his champ. Shit. Only that's in his losses, too, because he's I listen, because everybody everybody in the world is suffering financially. And I got to go in there and make a whole bunch of money and my family secure. So I lost technically. But I want in life and I'm winning, so I'm just ready to go back and do it again. He seriously feels great. And can I ask you this without you getting upset at me when I was watching it?  And I don't know, Tony, like you do. And after you won the just the coaches all the time. But when I was watching it in the fourth or definitely in the fifth, I would have thrown in the towel that crossed my mind, but I would have never done it.  But I thought, man, it was, it was as I know, you know, I have never I have never been a head made coach ever in my life. Never wanted to be. Never wanted to be. And I never even to this day, I've never been. That's on me. I'm not Trevor Whittman. That guy is amazing. I'm not a Greg Jackson, Duke, Rufus, that's a that's that's a whole nother level head coach.  That's the guy that should be talking to the fighter that sitting down. I know I'm I'm the wide receiver coach. I'm the guy that just throws in shit on the side, like, you know, especially in a stand up in a stand up fight. I shouldn't have been miked because I knew this was going to be satisfied if the fight was going to go down. There was a big fight. Yeah, maybe there's going to be a lot of groundwork.  Yeah, maybe it makes sense for television to Mike me, but whenever Mike hit me up, Mike, I'm just there for emotional support because it's going to be a stand up for Tony. Never. He hasn't had to take down in five years. He never takes anybody down. The last take down he got with Gleason DBO. Think about that. He doesn't take he goes out there and you know what he does when it when the fight ends up on the ground?  It's like from a scramble. Someone took him down. Kevin Lee takes him down. That's where his jujitsu comes in. We knew it was going to we were preparing for Kobe this whole time, which he was going to try to stay on his feet, obviously, and and do his thing.  And all of a sudden, two weeks before the fight, when it was April 18th, we get the opposite of not only the opposite in strategy, but the opposite and probably the heaviest handed lightweight, maybe ever, the most dangerous match for Tony, the most dangerous utilites people up with one shot.  Yeah.  So not even for one second did the camp think, oh, we got this one in the back from day one. From day one. So could you please let me finish this real quick? Let me get this off my chest.  So the whole time we're training for a certain strategy now, we got two weeks and now it's just engaging with the smart thing be to do totally change Tony style or say, fuck it, let's let's try to outboxes do Tony.  Tony wanted to fucking strike. Tony was like, I'm going to go out there and I'll box. And that was the plan. Nobody said one hundred percent it was going to work, you know what I mean. So and it was weird. It was everything about that, that that whole fight was weird. When you get there and there's nobody in the in the arena and it's super quiet. I've been to about one hundred and fifty. You have I've cornered a bunch of fighters in the UFC.  It was the weirdest thing.  And and one of the weirdest things was in between the first round and second round, they only allowed one Cotchin right.  Yes. And they said, who's it going to be? And I was the first one to say, not me. Like I don't want to be the I'm not the enemy head coach. It's got to be the striking coach that goes in there. Everybody agreed for sure. I'm like, I'm not going to be. It's always got to be the striking coach, the head coach, the guy that talks to him. I'm just the guy that offers suggestions.  I've never been never wanted to be.  Never tried to be. So Billy or Rashard, those are Rashad. Yeah. Rashad Holloway is is boxing coach. And Billy is we Tycho's. So one of them went in. I'm on the outside. I had nothing to say. All I could say was, Tony, you're looking good. That's it.  Did you know mean did either of them consider throw in the towel? No, we didn't talk about it.  I just had it in my head. I didn't talk about it. But this is what happened. So then the second and then the first round in my eyes at the at the event, I thought, OK, that could win either way. OK, second round at the very end with two seconds left he clips adjusting. So after two rounds I'm thinking, OK, now it's going to start to turn around. So at that point after the second round he knocked them down.  If he would have thirty seconds, who knows what would happen, who knows. But then at that point, now it's the third round. Right, OK, man, maybe Tony's going to turn it around like he always does. So at that point it was we weren't like thinking, OK, we got to take him down or anything like that. But after that fourth round, it was looking like, oh, shit. And right when the bell rung after the fourth round Rucha turns round goes Eddie get in there and like I wasn't ready for it man I wasn't ready to walk in there so I walked in there going What the fuck am.  I'm not a my head coach. This is the fourth round he's hurt and plus dude my car got broken into last week. They stole my glasses. I always I need my glasses. I'm pretty blind.  So I didn't really I didn't realize how how cut up he was until I walked up to him, like, OK, I'm supposed to give him advice. This wide receiver coach.  Like, I'm like it was a mistake for me to go in there. Not a bad idea for you to go.  I was like, at this point I thought maybe that's pulling guard or doing some imaginary roles works in the beginning when it's fresh, like the way Ryan Hall got B.J. Penn, remember Reichenhall him. It was early. Yeah. He went for ImmunoGen role. He was fresh. He locked him. If if we're going to do something like that, we have to strategize for that. The whole camp, not just like, hey, so I'm in there going.  At this point, he's hurt. He's cut up. A lot of things are swirling through my head and I'm thinking, oh, my God, what the hell? What is the best advice here? It's like, what is this? Cool. I need help here. I froze. And it's so quiet. It's so quiet. You know, you can usually like, dude, you got to take this motherfucker down, you know, but it's so quiet.  It's so goddamn quiet that everyone's like, you know, you're talking lower. It was just so weird, you know, self-conscious.  Brian Cowen just walked to the room. Brian Cowan, just please let him finish because he's. In the middle of describing himself into Tony Ferguson, I'm almost done, I'm almost done, so I walk in, the first thing I notice is he's cut up more than I can see from the corner. From my vantage point, I couldn't tell he had a big cut under his right eye. And at that point, that's my brother, man. That's my brother.  I'm thinking like, fuck. Like, maybe the best thing to do is stay on the outside for the fifth round and just get through this with no more damage. I was thinking maybe because if he tries to shoot now and he's really tired and he's he's hurt, it could be he could catch it. Me coming in, I'm thinking what what kind of advice?  And I just said you might want to try and you know, I don't know. I don't know. I froze. I didn't I don't think you froze because that's not bad advice as everything else wasn't working.  I've never been in that situation ever before in my life. And I don't want to be I'm not the guy for that.  I don't think about because I'm not the guy for that. I shouldn't have been in there. I'm always on the side. When I'm in the corner, I'm always on the side, you know what I mean? Just to throw a little little emotional support, I'm not going to the most important thing for a fighter. I've been in this business getting paid in the M&A business since 2000. I've seen fighters come and go. I work for the UFC for eight years, been to about one hundred and fifty UFC.  I've seen everybody come and go. I know my role and credit. I'm not doing Rufous. You're not giving yourself enough.  Those guys there on another level I am just hey, if he takes you down, you get that over hook and fucking hit that triangle. But this is me.  You're a fantastic jujitsu coach, but I think you're also smart enough to know where your strengths lie. And it's in the jujitsu. That's a good thing, man. It's a healthy thing. But you for sure have an understanding of how to coach someone in May. The thing is, there's like levels, right?  There's like for us, a hobby. Matt Hume level the wizards of tech gear.  And that's I mean, yeah, those are different guys. But those guys aren't ready when it comes to jets. No, they're not.  They're not. No, but but that's the point. It's like to be in both of them are very talented on the ground. By the way, Matt Hume was a wizard. Amazing, amazing man.  He was also a legit striker, very much worse than than you know, it.  When Matt Hume was on top of his game, he was amazed, was an incredible fighter. He was way ahead of his time. Amazing.  But but if I wonder if it went to the Granite State technical helmrich trying to finish the guy, Eddie would be my God, of course.  Yes, of course. Give yourself no credit. That is the thing about both those guys. We just know the whole game. They know the whole game for us is very good. It's true.  I don't know if you guys remember last year at PFL, the first round fighters fight twice in the same night.  Remember that, right? Yes.  And Vinny McGillis pulled guard in both of his fights early in the fight and tapped the guy real quick.  US right. Real quick. Real quick. But but you set it up and you work on it.  You know, we Tony's a striker man.  He wants to take your head off, you know what I mean? So. So. And then what happened in Vinnie's fight in the final of the tournament? He got really tired. You know, he was really tired at the end. He was trying to pull guard at the end, but he didn't have the energy to pull guard. You know what I'm saying? It's a lot the that set it up. It's like a takedown. You had he set it up.  Had he fought earlier that night in the finals? No, no, no. He went to the finals, were like months later. There is only one fight.  So he's tired in that fight and that fight. And he was trying to pull guard. He couldn't strike the guy. He was tired. And there was he was trying to pull guard, but he wasn't even close. He'd like land on his butt with no clench. And I forget who he fights, but he would just walk away. Look at this. He's got his back. This is. This is it. This is it. Oh, man.  Twenty seconds, Tony.  Story's not over. There's so many good fucking man. Oh, no. Dead one win. One win. He's right there.  You have to take into consideration the fact that it didn't really get a full chance to game plan for a guy who's dangerous as Justin and prepare for him.  There's going to be around eventually. There'll be a rematch it and the training camps going to be different. But but here's the one thing we could look back at. This is a blessing in disguise in one way, because originally Tony and Connor was the fight. But then Connor loses to Kobe. And then and now it's Tony in court. And Kobe was the fight. Now, since they're both coming off losses right now, Tony, and Kobe makes the most sense right now.  Can you imagine that, Tony and Connor? Oh, yeah. Come on. I know Tony and Connor. I'm sorry.  No, Connor's coming off a win, cowboy. Oh, that's right. That's right. That's OK. OK, but still it's still makes sense because he did lose.  It makes sense because it's hard to pick a corner. Could be fight right now.  It's it's like it's hard to pick gages right there. Gages right there would depend on what he wants to do in his dad and bad health. If he's out for a little longer, then he can do Geikie. Connor, that's true.  How about how about Gadg Kabab and Tony Connor Sankar. Oh, my God. Super Bowl. Oh, my God. People, people. That's perfect. That's I mean, come on. How crazy. Like New Year's Eve or something. But you also forget to be ridiculous. Oh, my dad would be used to it right now.  And then the winner is the winner of each fight. Just amazing car. Tony, Tony. Versus Tournament and Jaji versus could on everybody's heads.  What a world wide world simultaneously to some some other dark horses for Tony like Dustin Pedroia is right there.  Charles Oh yeah. Charles a little. Bolivia impresses me as much as anybody to do it when he strikes heavenly. I was like, this is crazy. This strike has gotten so much better down, staying on the same spot every day. And his ground work is more submissions in any sport. But now it strikes. See his tracking's right there. He's so dangerous right now and he follows, man, he follows.  You know, his technique is like real smooth and the confidence is there. Now, he's a different he's different. Other, Tony. That's all I'm saying. Connaughton, that's in the mix, too. That's not the I'm not telling you, Charles.  Oliviera might be the dark horse. That division. That's what I'm saying for sure. Could be he's for like 30 years old. Man, we've known that kids. But he was like he was fighting all the way through for a while. Yeah. But now he's not here. You don't know if he's on the left fight. I was like, holy shit, he's shutting down Kimberly's fucking good. And then he tapped him on that gear team and Kevin tried to take him down.  That was time.  That was people sleeping on him. It was like next level tight. It was like next level world championship game. Two towns. My daughter's that division is the doctors. That's an amazing Tony's out for how long?  Because it's the broken orbital, right? No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  He's good. He's already he's training today. Did not want a savage dude. I'm telling you, man, I swear he's inspiring. He fought after a catastrophic knee surgery like six months later and it was treated well.  That's crazy. When he when he explained it the way I'm like when he said, hey, listen, the whole world is struggling financially. And I made the biggest paycheck of my life, biggest payday. How can I be sad?  He's a weinerman. So where are you kidding me?  But hey, this is another thing is we're seeing levels, man. We're seeing new levels, just engages next level, like just engage. First of all, one of the things that Trevor Whitman said that I was really impressed with, he said she's the most coachable athlete he's ever worked with.  He's he's form great. You gotta remember he was saying that to. Yeah. Lucario. They're both all my boys. But you remember gages they molded gayety from. He came from the gym in northern Colorado down a grudge. And Trevor's like, let's do it, dude. In nine years molding that kid nine years.  Dude, he's he's so coachable, too, because one of the things that happened, you were talking about the shift in the second round when he got hit with that big uppercut at the end of the round, he went back to his corner and Trevor Wittman said, you're going to hard at him, take a time. Ten percent off of the punches, don't take his head off, hit him with good, clean shots. And he nodded his head and he went out, did exactly that.  How about when Justin would rock'em and then sit back and like, oh, he's ready for that? Oh, he's ready for him to be because most of the guys rocking that Russian. Yeah.  You'd sit back. You go with this coming technical.  He was smooth and he looked like a world charm. I kind of like a hair trigger. That left hook counter was a hair trigger, just like it's coming out of nowhere.  I think he's in give Kobe some nightmare, a nightmare because the best wrestler could Beeb's ever face who doesn't want to wrestle, like in terms of wrestlers in the octagon.  I mean, who could be who's better than him? I mean, you're talking about an all American Division one champion face in a fight.  Has anybody had the level of wrestling that he has?  No. Think about this. He's going to be able to heal. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Treehoppers was the all-American.  You might have been Juc all-American, which is strong motherfucker. And he took him down like seventeen right now.  But you can't strike fear with one thing, Gadge compare against Gadge. And I think I think gages one of the one of the best for sure. But if it could be, it can take him down.  Man how is that going to look back? It's a real, real important point. He might not be able to take them down. Oh no. Maybe not. Maybe not. Don't get them down. Maybe not just because I've heard stories. I think you've heard what he can do to add Ruth and Luke Rockholt in DC.  I've heard in case you don't you think so? It doesn't mean just the fight.  I need to see him training with those guys because it's almost like one of those mythical tales you hear about some things that people see in the woods.  Do you like Bigfoot? Yeah, but what? Dude, when I was a wrestler, when I was in San Jose, Josh Thompson goes, you've got to kind of practice to Beeb's training. It's wrestling day. I want to go. But I had you know, I was like, not too far and I didn't do it. I'm shoot myself in the I eye.  I talked to John Fitch about it. John. Yeah, there you go. John Fish is like, yeah, I know. What's it like to wrestle me? Because they started with Preethi? Because I, I mean, I got to like if I'm very well rested because sometimes I can stand up like John Fitch.  John Fish is a monster legend. Let's say he went on and he's going in wrestling. How did John Fish do in restitch. Never lost.  I mean, I think he's a. What's this Mercurochrome cop thing, he was killer OSes, the Hall of Fame. Is this the fight? What happened to the man that crashed? No, not I think.  Oh, my God, that Apple TV crashed. And I thought, oh, reset it.  Well, I'm doing open Kevin around them in the Hall of Fame or we didn't even watch that Cheeto verify. We barely won or lost any story we had with Tony. I've been waiting. We you know, I've been. Can't wait to hear.  Oh, no, no. Listen, man, I couldn't wait to hear it either. It was one of the first of all, one of the most epic fights and one of the weirdest ones to see a fight like that with no one in the.  Is it weird for you or you guys felt pretty sure just felt pretty comfortable for. No, there was.  I love John Anick and I love DC. I love you guys are the best team with those guys. Yes, they're the nicest guys.  It's a pleasure to see them. I need you guys together though.  I knew that we were all tested, man. We were all just like so we had to have bracelets that showed that we've all tested negative. So we're all walking around with these bracelets on. So let us sit next to each other and we stood next to each other.  Well, in the pre we're basically right there.  You appreciate the stranger. This is the strangest I heard. I heard they didn't wanna let you in the octagon for the interviews. They wanted me to do the interviews from like fifty feet away. It was like I was going to stare into a camera and the fighter was going to stand on cameras. They were going to have a monitor monitor. I go, I go. They just fought. I go, this is crazy. I want to be right next to it.  You know, it's crazy.  You know, when you shook his head, just engaged his hand, you were like fucking I don't give a shit because there was blood on, you know, someone like.  Edited that out or something like, I don't know, something about that, a friend of mine said, dude, check check this out like you said something and they cut that out, like to YouTube.  It tested. He got tested like literally they had the test. They isolated all the fighters. They isolated all the cornerman. They tested everybody. We can't live in fear forever. Do you know what I'm talking about? Yeah, I do. Take what any do they get upset because I don't know about the editing, but I know that some people got upset that I shook his hand.  Like, how. Did you go did you go to restaurants in Jacksonville? They banned that.  We went to a Morton's Steakhouse. We went to I went to red appetizers. We went to I went to a restaurant every day I was there.  Oh, we're going with other people who do that in Houston.  I can't wait here. We went to the bearded pig. Do you just get one reported? Just little red, just one rib. And I was like this much meat on it. One is a beef rib. It's yeah.  It's some kind of brontosaurs weird go in the restaurant. Did you feel when I was totally. But the waiter had a mask.  Oh yeah. That was down. He was talking to us so he's like, hey man, I love your podcast.  Where are you to see your eyes. We're not that get used to being nice because I don't think that's going to happen in our life, or at least I don't think.  Go to San Diego. Go to venture. Diego Garcia is a very strange dude.  Something's going on.  Did you see that article that who is that guy?  There was a conservative. This is going to take a politician in. I'm talking about San Diego.  I'm thinking about Texas. I've been saying that if one goes, we all go. I would love that would be the would love to leave. Texas is mad.  You come over here, you just bring your liberal bullshit and that's not OK. Easy.  You're going to Austin. Oh, I love Austin. Yeah. It's like I'm saying liberal. I mean, Austin's liberals forget.  Did I send that to you guys. That article about the San Diego guy.  Oh yeah. Here it is. I'm going to send it to Jamie because I don't San Diego with the six deaths.  Six, that's what I'm sending you that say, oh, no, you sent it to me. I said, if you talk about that, you will be OK. You can be taken off YouTube by doctors. You said that you have a point zero three percent chance dying in L.A. or something like that. And they were that that video was taken down. Facebook and YouTube will take down your video if they consider.  I guess I'm free, Brian. You'll enjoy this. You'll love this. I just found out from our boys I meant pixels to go. Hey, can you and Brian the first five minutes not talking about penises or know who gives a fuck you to YouTube's demonetization channel. And when you cuss in the first five minutes.  Oh, you fuck. You ruined everything I can. Fizer Jim Desmonte says San Diego has has only had six pure coronavirus deaths. Whoa. So what he's saying is all the deaths that they had, everyone had an underlying cause except for six that were pure coronavirus.  Six out of three point three million Harriot boys I love takes much of the next guy, La Hoya. We go to the Comedy Store there. I love it when I can say as much in taxes, but we can serve fish tacos.  They're locked down. They're open up more than us. I know, but we should listen.  I mean, there's no simple, easy way to do this.  We just got to we got to look at how the states act over the next couple of weeks. And this judge the states and talk about what states are are also, I don't tell you, Atlanta, but also Atlanta, Florida.  All the states need to if you want to help people talk about health, No. One, no, no one's doing it. All these people are talking about it's fear. They're talking about the disease, how quickly it spreads, how people carry it in. They don't even know they're talking about all these things about the disease, which is great. But put you want to help people put out a message to change your fucking diet.  Yeah. How about the Belgium health minister? Hilarious. Get you get your life in Switzerland. People diet. Yeah, it destroys people, really destroys them. It was one of the number one factors in people that it really is more of a weirdo.  There's a lot of money. The city flu does that like obese and people with all these diseases, diseases, underlying conditions like this one, we were led to believe it was going to be something that it wasn't.  They thought it was different than it was.  We're lucky now. They came back. We're lucky. But you have we have to admit we're lucky. And we have to admit, obviously, people did a lot of great work and the first responders, the bravest fucking human beings alive to stuff that we were scared about it in our homes. And these fucking people are dealing with sick patients in day out every day.  But we have to recognize the difference between what happens to them and what's what's what and what happens to the rest of us and what can be fixed with nutrition, what can be fixed with medicine, what can we fix first?  But also the actual odds of dying from the disease is at a certain point in time, you got to let people be free. And I don't know when that is. Give us a guy.  Should be like people who don't have everything. I don't know what the. Yeah, but people don't believe that the people in power right now, the larger issue, the larger issue, I think, is that you have people in power, especially in and I'm sorry, but I feel this way about Eric Garcetti and Gavin Newsom and I and I a lot of the people around him who who have this arbitrary executive control to make decisions that affect all our lives and destroy businesses may be irreparably by and with what some health bureaucrats by saying, well, you know what everybody has to wear.  We're going to mandate masks and we're going to extend this now that we flatten the curb. And by the way, the hospitals in Los Angeles are empty. Our health system is not overrun and we have flat in the curve. You know what? Take a seat for another three months.  Take a seat for and then snitch on your neighbor. The mayor's tweeted that it's not just snitch on your neighbor, but snitch on businesses. So this this is unprecedented.  And I think this is executive overreach. And it was challenged in Wisconsin and overturned, in my opinion, rightly so in Illinois. We'll see now as these states open. We'll see if the death toll climbs. But we know that that this is a disease that threatens people with underlying and severe morbidities and just like all of us who are much older.  So is it doesn't it make sense to target quarantine? Can't we quarantine people who are, let's say, 70 and over?  Speak your logic, right? Yeah, no, no. None of this. There's no logic with dealing with ideology.  I'm sorry. And and I'm amazed. And I think that you want to hear what I think. I think even people like CNN and Garcetti and these people, I think they're really interested in restructuring society. Yes. I think they get drop out at all costs.  I think it's about power to Russia. They're going, you motherfuckers. This is what we've been trying to do this whole time, because now you guys are doing it. Oh, dude. In Russia, they're loving it. When. How do you how do you think they want to restructure?  Like, if you were just guessing. Well, and there's Choco's. What I think is this so so when you keep an economy shut down long enough, you have to look at this three trillion dollar stimulus package. That's that's three thousand billion dollars. Three thousand dollars do that.  Yeah, but but it's important and it's crazy because a lot of money, it's three trillion dollars.  And in it what happens with government when what you're doing is really essentially spending your way trying to spend your way out of a problem.  What that really means, though, is government has to take over these aspects of the economy and your lives that they didn't before. And I think this is about power. I think this is about the expansion. Yes. And I really do think to this quote we talked about on the way up here, but they should see it.  Garcetti had a quote that we have to wear masks and if we do the right thing and wear masks, we'll get back some of our freedoms.  That's one man, but just one man just saying it that way. Get back some of our freedoms.  Like you can't take away freedoms we can to you know, something like this is simple.  Mayor Garcetti orders Angelenos to wear masks whenever leaving home.  We can recall him. You just need you.  I think you need three signatures, petitions. Let's do it. Let's get together. And we call him. Let's call them. I'm down. Let's do it. And I don't think I don't think call that motherfucker. I don't think they know how to let go of power. And I think nobody does. I think this is not the same argument that we had two months ago when we entered into this. That argument was we have to stop this thing because it kills a giant percentage of the population, runs through thirty three million.  Remember that?  And it turns out, look, it's horrible if you get it, but if if you get it for the most part, you're probably going to be asymptomatic or are not going to have bad symptoms, just like you guys, just like it doesn't take it.  But the problem is it sounds callous to say that. Right, because that what about someone who lost someone who had what?  People die all the time from the flu to make motorcycles illegal. Check this out. Your to pick game up or you ask the question.  Callon, let me ask you a question. What would you rather have? Someone give your whole family covid or that same person, get drunk and rammed their car into your whole family on the freeway.  I'd rather have them give the covid. What about you? The death rate between zero and 18 zero covid or a drunk driver crashed into your entire life.  I will look everybody's face in this room, right? The obvious question, right?  Yes, it's it's an obvious question. It's almost a question that everybody's like, come on. Exactly. But that many think about how many car accidents there are every year. Yes. Think about how easy it is, how easy it would be for someone to make a mistake and kill people.  Doing a number of things that we do all the time.  Happens all the time. Imagine we chalk it up as the price for driving just diseases. Think about this.  You know, they could you know how they could destroy the legalization of marijuana right now. You know, they could do it easy.  This how they do it, they know they could destroy it. They could make weed illegal.  Right now, all they got to do is say it, start doing what they're doing with the like, forging the the death certificates of anybody that dies. Anybody that crashes with anybody that dies from a drunk driving accident just put marijuana accident. Call D.W. Barbecue drunk or driving while barbecued no matter right down there to do that.  Hold on. Hold on. And then. And then every night. Every night. When you turn on the news, you put on the death count of all the people that are dying of marijuana, driving deaths and then start looking, you know, putting footage of all these car wrecks that are going on all the time. We never seem OK. We never see it here. And somebody said yes. And so that's what's going on. But I also think that I also think there's a disconnect.  But with a lot of journalists and a lot of politicians, there's a major disconnect between them and everyday Americans who have to make a business work. So if you had Paul Krugman, who is a Nobel Prize winning economist, who is a regular op ed contributor to The New York Times, he wrote the most condescending article. He's never had a real job, in my opinion, but that's a different story.  But what is right for The New York Times? He's got a real job. He's always been incredibly left wing. There's a difference, though, because he's good at talking and writing. Come on. It's our first time back. It's my fault. I can't drive a car. I'm not so sure. The hours you took one of them, Elon bus hits, why did you take it? Even several hours of cage fighting got caught on video. Why don't we go on one of my watch?  Elon Musk.  I got so high from this.  This is a blunt speaking. If you want me to finish my thought, let me finish. So because the thought was this.  I do know, he said that right wingers lump a whole group of people called right wingers into one thing. Right.  He said right wingers are coming up with these conspiracies and are against the lockdown because they care about the Dow Jones. And that's what he and that's how he categorized everybody who was against the Dow Jones. The shutdown saying our family instead about feeding families, people who who have spent their lifetime building a business and it's going under and may not come back or somebody who has spent all their time building a brand and relies on that. And so there's never any consideration for that because those people have never done that.  And when you've never done that, you don't know what it's like.  I think they're doing they want to destroy the economy. I think they're doing it on purpose. I think that's the whole purpose of this to get Trump out. Exactly.  I'm never this cynical. I'm never this conspiratorial trying to destroy them. It's the first time in my life where I'm thinking to myself, that's the purpose.  These people might be thinking, can we just chalk up as he's been right about the whole Trump stuff, all that bullshit, real careful about drawing conclusions about why that's point.  Which is what? Conspiracy theory? Second, it's a good point, but this is really important. It's just a natural part of human nature to not want to relinquish power. The founding fathers knew that. The Founding Fathers knew that George Bush, which is why you don't have executive overreach, which is why it can be challenged in the courts, which is why it has to be it is a natural human behavior that's I don't have it, but I do, too.  That's that cop who lost his job.  Was it Greg Anderson and Greg Henderson, the dude in Washington who was like, this ain't right when exactly. And then lost his job because, like, we technically can't do this. It's against the Constitution. Whoever that guy's find out who that guy is, I'm pretty sure it's Greg Anderson trying to check.  I got to check my he's a BJ. He's a black belt and he's a Special Forces guy.  Yeah, he was a ranger. You know what he said? You know, I'll never be happy because I'm not built like this guy here to show the fight about Anderson. So I'm sorry about with about Anders. Yeah.  Well, he also played linebacker at Alabama. You fuck he's starting linebacker.  So he's a little stronger, a little more powerful than I. Oh, he's a fucking monster.  He's a great fighter. Too big power but goes a fucking beast too is such a good fight. This is like been all over it.  Yeah. Choco's are very good striker. Yeah. He's fun to watch and Anders is so tough dude.  When he fought Kallu Roundtree raunchy was lighten his legs up and he never even flinched. Anders starting linebacker.  You say Alabama. I'm going to try football and he's, I'ma try fighting and he's been fighting that.  Starting linebacker to the Nats championship Alabama team, and here's the thing, you know how like when you see, like, 18 year old kids in jujitsu, like they get good really quick, it's kind of scary, you know, like I don't know what it is about people when they get older where it doesn't work like that.  And I think it's not a difficult thing.  I think it's also like a resources thing. You don't have the resources to think about it all the time.  You don't have the resources to be obsessed with bills like, yeah, 18 year old kid who still lives at home can try to be the world's best boxer. Yes.  You know, and you're running up, go to bed at night, sleep and live in it, and they get good quick. And his body doesn't get hurt. He recovers faster. Look at great people, you know, people and shit on.  Greg Hardy hasn't been fighting that long and he's in the UFC and has like eight fight. These won most of them.  And how about he fought? VOLKOV All right. Volkova One ballot. Yeah. Fucked his arm up. He built Volkoff was the Bellator heavyweight champ. And before he fought Derek Lewis, a lot of people thought he might be the dark horse of the division. Hundred percent tall, didn't stop Fabrício.  Yes, Makhdoom But remember, he's very close to until the very end in the first Neisseria.  Lewis What? He's absolutely one of the most entertaining guys ever, because you never know, you never know if he's going to be able to pull it off. That final striker. That was the perfect fight. Example that with Derek Lewis, you never know.  You can never catch and you can never count because there is the helmet Berro.  That was chaos. Do you have my knife? So I want to come.  Oh, I need me that knife. I do. I need that knife.  I'm only cutting with my knife. Who is the company? Seville, where I need it for the silverware.  You guys are awesome. Thank you. Not not right here but there in the studio. In the room somewhere. Where are they. I don't like people who keep my knives. Yeah, it's Greg Officer Greg Anderson. I don't know whether I said Greg Anderson. They're definitely here though. But they get bad with names.  Yes, I got a. I think that's it is that it is if there's two Grammy one, B, there's the rattlesnake. There's one. I don't think there's another one there, there's a small there's a pocket knife, a folding knife this. Oh, that's a big ass Japanese knife that things that shit that was a sponsor. What do you have so many nights I know I'm a problem or not. Or not.  Yeah, I never quite grew up in secret. First of all, civil war. Forget this knife. I want to thank civil war. Thank them.  There's a there's a small folding knife in their two brothers. That's really all I need is a folding knife. What you need is a gun. I love that. I have a 15 and a run with that. No bike with it. How about this?  Like some shooting Michigan storming the Capitol building.  I'm shooting it at Taren Tactical and Technical stop. And Logan Paul shows off. So he shows up. So he's behind me. Love him. And great guy. What a sweetheart. I told such a love to stud and stud. Handsome kid, athletic kid talking a little bit about man.  Joe saw him in Hawaii. Right. So looking back to normal day, a very normal, great guy. I saw him after his fight. Now, there you go.  Yeah, he stood and we went to the a sweetheart anyway. So he so he's mommy and I and turn stop I what he was. Do you hit a bird. And I'm like, oh shit.  So I go over there and I, I winged the dove like a straight up white dove to know how I wasn't a white dove.  It was, it was a dirty brown one. Yeah. But no it was a gray but it was beautiful piece but also kill him, you know. And then and. No, no.  And I did I said, I said give me the gun. I mean, I was going to shoot it to put it out of misery. And he goes, I'll do it. And I go, no, let me do it. You know, it's my job because no, I'll do it.  And Logan goes, Wait, I think the guy's going to be all right. I look at Logan.  I looked at thing in his I could see feathers flying and the thing just goes looks at Logan and just things but flies away.  And I was like, did you shoot in the way of Holy Ghost energy? I shot it.  I winged it. Because you know what, I don't like birds being on my targets to me.  Neither do I mean that little knife. And then I'm going to I'm high and I'm drunk.  It's dangerous, bro. I need one of those. Hey, bro, this is from Civil War. That's my cheese cutter. This is if that's what I wear, you've got to give him one.  I need one for tomorrow.  That's not going to help you if you get that close through the rattlesnake.  You already bit. But I went so close to stab it.  That's the most ridiculous line mine. OK, I could shake my cheese cutter too.  I wear this in my boot in case Brennan decides to surf. Into what? How are we going to feel when the first hiker gets jacked by a mountain lion? What's good chance? Me, I'm out there thriving every day I'm out there. I imagine that could happen real soon, almost any day. And then how do you think people would feel if that became like a normal thing?  Nothing like I will ever know about it. It's whatever they give me, it's whatever they decide to focus on. People are dying all over the place. Well, do just die by a great white shark. Not far.  Oh, where was he swimming now? Santacruz jackaroos. It was it. No, it was a Santa Cruz.  That's close enough. I no it's not Santa Barbara.  Imagine if fucking Godzilla attacked Santa Cruz were like oh that's five hours so far away. I'm not. How fast does he walk? I'm tired. You know, we leave in the morning.  You know, one of the coolest things about the companion to me personally, for me guys, one conversation here.  We're just fighting over knives.  Eddie, I said one of the coolest things about like for me personally is that we're all pro-gun. That's huge. Man, that's a cue. Imagine if we were all anti-gun sitting here.  Just imagine that on a sitting duck. It's just a dangerous thing to do to give anyone all the power. And that includes the power to shoot you.  That's actually right. Only like what we're seeing, what's happening with laws. This is the same thing that happens with guns right now.  It really is. It's really unfortunate. But what government tends to be always is just people. It's just people. They're people, right. They're just people that got elected to office. And they might be great people, but they're still people and people.  You can't give them power over other people and they're easily corruptible and male, malleable.  And they find suicide to with they find ways to make it legal for them to influence things that if you just straight up gave them the money to do those things, you would say, no way.  That's the nature of the great experiment called the United States of America mental gymnastics.  How many how many you guys know dudes that were anti-gun who are like asking you about guns?  Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I know.  I know I was anti-gun for the wrong team, even though, you know, Joe's one of the best friends. Brian superwomen gun carrying a gun. I was anti-gun. I just I was like, I don't need one. Why would I need to go and use them as human? And then when my house got broken into, I'm like, I need guns.  Of course I need your guns and dogs. Every time I see a video of someone getting robbed or jumped or or killed, I'm like, oh, man, I want to get another gun.  I want to get another one and then another one. I want fucking a bazooka.  Oh I, I loaded up on, you know, I loaded up on ammo. Fifteen if the alarm goes off. You got a plan. I got a plan with me and my wife. Go over. Plan all the time when the alarm goes off, we each have our 50 rope ladders and shoot. What's up, bro? Oh yeah, she shoots.  But this is not a thought that most of us want to confront, like right now.  Now, eight, I was too high. I was at a drive thru. I'm perfect. The right about of high.  I was at a drive through a few days ago in a bad part of downtown.  I want to drive through and ride up to my window and like MS 13 guy next, I'm Mexican. So this guy was very he could have been San Salvadorian or something rural.  You know, he looked like those pictures when you Google MS 13 came right to my door, like on the passenger side. I was driving this way. I'm on the other side of was.  Like, give me, like, roll down your window, give me some money, and I just looked at them like I you know what, fuck this. I put it in reverse. I look behind me. That was the car behind me, car in front of them, like.  And then the guy goes like, why you do not like my car? So I.  I had a fucking screwdriver. I had a screwdriver in my car. I'm like, oh shit. Boom. And I grab it and I just held it like that and I was just like this.  I choked him out. Huh. Who knows. He could of had a gun, he could've had a gun, got a train. He could've easily had a gun. If I would add a gun shit I would have felt a lot dude. I felt vulnerable. Like if this guy pulls out a gun and does that, that could be my last day on earth.  Fuck am I to drive in a fucking Lucie's. You're fucking with Joe right now, Joe.  Don't sweat. So yeah. No, no, no. I swear to God we all swear to God about this. Damn, I might die right here. I thought about this. That's why you might die right here in Texas.  You get shot in the fucking face dude.  We all have to. We all have to think about this.  Yeah. Shit's getting crazy. Did.  And the other thing that we have to think of is how quick can we bring it back to a manageable place?  How quick does in L.A. take to bounce back? But I think in L.A., what's going to happen there? See all these other states open up and we're going to put so much pressure on Newsom and Garcetti where they have no choice. If you look at the numbers in Ohio, Atlanta, they have no Denver. They have San Diego. You have no fucking choice.  No one no one understands. People don't think they're easily fooled with cases and numbers. They're so easily fooled. Most people have no idea that. Eighty thousand people died last year of the flu, the exact same symptoms, the exact same death of people that are dying of Corona.  It's thing it's that many, but it's a lot. It's like sixty thousand sixty. Yeah, some something. But some say the way. Can you imagine. Can you imagine.  It's like. It's like who. If they put the spotlight on a another there's about 200 strains of the flu. I'm not sure how many strains. There's a bunch. Right. I thought I read it. It's always there's. Yeah. I mean how many people die from rattlesnakes. Yeah. No, no.  What I'm saying is it's not that many. What I'm saying is there's all these technical names, there's all these technical names for all that's like how many grizzly bear deaths, like brothers, whatever. No awesome points that if you just started putting the spotlight on it like car wrecks, if you if on the news it was just filled with car wrecks, that's all people would be telling you you should be fucking driving. Well, you shouldn't be fucking driving.  We would be in a world of cigarettes.  Yes, we would be against cigarettes would be, you know, about alcohol.  You know, easy would be the ban driving, you know, do they just said all sports and concerts done and it happened.  You think they could just say driving make driving illegal? You think they're going to happen? We're in the middle of the new world order right now. We're in the middle. They shut everything down.  So there should be nobody ever saying, oh, look, those guys, all those guns, look, all those got anybody that says, oh, those guys are with their Corona conspiracy theories, with their Korona dude, we're in the greatest conspiracy theory of all time right now. Right now is the greatest of all time. Everything got shut down. If I would have told you last year I could do next year. Everything's going to shake out of the world.  They go worldwide. You would say worldwide. I go worldwide. Every fucking country. Let me let me offer you stop. Let me just finish this real quick.  Let me just finish this thought. Thirty seconds. I apologize. We'll get that. No, no. Go back to the to out to what you're saying.  No, what I'm saying is if I would have told you that a year ago, I said there's going to be if I would have said there's going to be a great if this impeachment if this impeachment fails, they're going to come hard with that last hope.  This is stop.  Stop. That's not a conspiracy. Let me let me stop you, because it's not you have to realize how many people died versus how many people were out there. There's a big difference between the way they approached it. If everybody was open in society the way it was, it would have spread quicker. It would have been more people that says hold my margarita.  Sweden says hold my margarita.  Well, it's Japan closed down for political, slowed down the transmission to make people aware if they wash their hands more, if they put masks on, if they did all that shit the beginning, maybe it slowed it down. You got to think that number is higher. It's like eighty something thousand now, right. That number is higher than the flu. And they did that. So it's worse than the flu. It's it is fucking dangerous. If you're not healthy, it's fucking dangerous.  Can I explain something to the table?  Here's what here's the alternative perspective. What you're thinking is some grand conspiracy to overthrow Trump. What I think it is, is they got some power when we were forced to all collectively decide to let them. Take the reins and lock everyone down to protect ourselves from a very real virus. This is a bunch of numbers of the virus are very real. The scientists behind the virus are very real. That's right.  But the problem is human beings in power.  That's the problem. I think I agree with that. We thought we'd see these experts, these experts, these scientists and, you know, Foushee, those people are wrong a lot of times, but it's almost guaranteed by the government, the defendant.  They're getting paid by the women and men. Do you understand? Well, Joe, he didn't see it coming.  He went, that's not a really big deal. We shouldn't be wearing masks.  Well, because we had never had something like this happen when we got bad information from another country that experienced the deception going on.  Something you got to go, OK, maybe like there's so much bullshit going on and all these lies forging death certificates all over the fucking case.  But the numbers really don't. Realistically, though, there was when they when they had this moment when they identified the World Health Organization was saying that, that also they were saying, no, they're not.  But I'm saying that China was saying that you could get it from a person, that it was it was only transmittable from like that animal to fuck.  Could we listen? They're not they're not trustworthy.  Nobody that you mentioned is trustworthy and they're all working together all the way to the ship and like, wait a minute, one way to mask the bullshit starts flying around.  It's hard to figure out. There's a lot of theories.  You got to go. You just because you make a conclusion and it's wrong doesn't mean you don't make fun of the person that makes it detectives. They put together facts and you make conclusions. Some detectives go, I think it might be this guy. The other detective goes, no, it's probably his brother and someone's going to be wrong. They're not going to make fun of the other person for being wrong. Honestly looking for the truth. We're putting the facts together.  You when all I'm saying is there's so much bullshit with the padding of the numbers, forging of the death certificate.  I'm not a statistician. I don't know if those numbers are accurate.  I don't know. Nobody knows.  But the fact that it's a concern and I bet it's listen, I think the reality is it's probably a concern both ways. I bet a bunch of people died and they didn't listed as covid in the house. Oh, no, they get paid off.  But I bet a lot of people get paid because I didn't. But I don't think they get paid if they find a body.  No, I think they paid more in the hospital.  Why would they find out? Why would they get it? Why would a hospital get paid to have a COVA death? Like, why would they why would that happen?  Federal money. I think it is the hospital. Why does the hospital get paid covid? I think that doesn't make any sense.  No, no, no, no. It does exactly how it works. How does it work is what I'm asking. Is their allocated money to stay open because there's a massive crisis that strains the resources in a way that's unprecedented. So they send them a bunch of money.  Yes, it is in strange sources in the Senate to keep it.  OK, OK, look look at it like this, Brian. Look, as soon as you establish that the players like maybe you didn't know them in the beginning, you believed them, whatever. And then now there's so much obvious deceit and deception and lies at that point.  You got to go, oh, OK. We got to go. We got to backtrack. Maybe all this shit is deception and maybe there's other reasons why. Wait a minute. You got some point. Maybe this was an opportunity at the start. I think graphs were wrong. Everything was wrong. But I think this was a black swan and it presented itself.  And now, as Joe said, the people in power have been taking this as an opportunity to consolidate.  No, I totally respect that. I was there. I was a very weird position.  Now all I'm saying, people just like us are controlling people. All I'm saying deciding all I'm saying is, Brian, that theory and your theory, hey, I'm not going to make fun of it.  These are all just theories. No one. No shit. There's so much deception. We should all be going manic. And maybe it's that. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's that. Maybe it's not like a fuck, you fucking crazy, dude. This is all the crazy shit.  Here's I know the crazy, but we have to talk systemically because I think all of us, all of us would behave very differently if we were in power.  And one of the things you said is human behavior and power. When people are in power, when people are in power, we don't know all of this.  We don't want power of us. I want to protect our our vision of the world.  I don't have power. But Joel has power. I don't want to say. What I'm saying is that if you were in first of all, if you're going to politics, you probably like being in that position. Yeah, but the other thing is, I think it's very it's almost impossible for a human being not to want to project their vision of the world on the world that's in it.  But things do, though. We all have points of view.  But that's all you have a constitution that's like, well, they can't take away the rights to the founding fathers were very aware of that human tendency, human error. That's why we have checks and balances. And, man, we're losing that. The Constitution. I mean, we're where we are primates. We we we seek to control. It's a natural part of how. We got here in the first place. We just have to avoid it now, we have to recognize what it is.  We have to be very steadfast and not giving in to it, because when when when ego starts controlling people and when people in power consolidate that power and don't want to relinquish it when the facts come in, yeah, he becomes dangerous for every problem.  For whatever reason, we all agree it's a problem. But Facebook and YouTube and these other outlets that control so much of the way we communicate are very slanted and don't in many senses that they're censoring their raising.  But that's a huge problem. The problem with it, they'll censor things up to a point, right? Right. You can have, you know, a flat earth video.  They'll let that stay up there, the barrier. But but it doesn't matter. It still exists.  I believe they'll live out Florida and Georgia and the great and Texas and the I don't know.  But I'm saying like people like they get to decide at a certain point in time what should what should be argued for and what should not be. And when it gets to a certain level of ridiculousness, you know, like I bred with Bigfoot, you could put that up. That's cool. You can get to a certain like. And my point was, what about evangelist's? You know, they're stealing money from people. Why are there videos on YouTube?  They're stealing money from the dumbest people.  And the interesting question is exactly the slippery slope.  So so the how are you to say if people put on YouTube that tumeric, for example, if I didn't see Cure's covid, take that down. And that's right. And I did the same thing with the Atsumi. They did the same thing with the anti vaccine. But but that is that is a fact that it doesn't cure it.  I think the solution is you put a note that says, like when you put the video up or if you go to click on it on YouTube, you should have like like whatever organization you want that could refute that health systems that they are not happy with.  The outcome keep you from dying of vitamin C is essential for a healthy immune system. Super essential vitamin D not you're not a chubby.  I'm not a doctor. But that's beside the point. It's not even about this this old school shit, I don't know. But that's beside the point. The video shouldn't be taken down right now. But but but it is being taken. That's what that's a problem.  Of course, whenever someone censors whenever someone censors the basically saying, I'm smart enough to know this is bullshit, but I don't think you are or there's another reason or there's other reasons that could be political reasons, which is probably what's going on.  Listen, there's always the potential for not just such a moral to say these are moral decisions. Yeah, these are these are these are political. And you're like, oh, shit, it's OK.  And that Anders Larson decision, he had a cup of Rick James. There's there's all this team locked down and there's team freedom. There's only two teams, Facebook.  Facebook took down a protest that was in opposition to social distancing and all these measures.  And Facebook decided that that's harmful and that's in spreading false information.  So they took down the actual right man. So think about this. What we're dealing with guys in lockdown is true censorship. Yeah. And we don't believe in freedom of speech anymore. And you'll hear people who say things like this. We're a nation obsessed with freedom. Americans need to learn that freedom is not the end.  I don't want is exposed to dangerous, dangerous content on our job. But that's why when they asked us to wear masks, we have a group text. I said everybody, I said I said, take over.  I said they might have they might have looked at the studies from these three countries. They wore masks and everything declined. So maybe they do it because this and then Brian goes, you got to realize it's they're not doing it. If I wear a mask, then what's the next thing? If you start wearing these mask, they start taking away that and you wear mask everywhere you go.  The what's in I'm going to do anything to win away from people that take away our cars like that. No fucking driving. You know this what I'm scared of this what I'm scared of. Hey, when I hear Elon Musk talking about he's on our side.  You think he's team OK, there's team lock down and then there's team freedom. You would think he hangs out. I mean, he's part of that team lock down. Let me. Not at all. No, no, no, no, no. He's going to move to Texas. Finish. Let me just finish. I'm sorry.  I'm just team locked down. It appears to me. I mean, he claimed he got a car into space anyways.  OK, so what? Think whatever. Well, that's another hour. But anyways, what I'm saying is when he starts talking shit, I will go nuts.  He's a man. But when he was on your podcast and he said the things he said about the lockdown and tyranny and all that, at first I was like, fuck, yeah, Ilan's fucking let me let me help you out.  Let me finish though. Let me just finish. Thirty seconds. We get back. It's just give me thirty something brother.  I'm just trying to finish this point.  There's a point to this. OK, so Elon Musk now he's, he's like, he's like it seems like he's on team freedom. Holy shit. That's, that's if that's real. That's beautiful. But my. Respiratory mine. Oh, we think like what if I don't know, these are just conclusions, don't make fun of me, but this would be a great idea for Team Lockton if team locked us. How do we keep lockdown going? Say, hey, check this out, Elon.  You're going to pretend you're a rebel, you're going to hold on. This is just a conspiracy. This is not true. Right? I hope this is not true. I hope he's I hope he's legit. OK, I'm praying that he's OK. I pray so. But what about this team? Lockdown tells Ellen, hey, listen, be a rebel controlled opposition, be a rebel. Say you're just going to open up your plan and then we say, fuck it up, thousand Korona deaths and then we restock the lockdown because.  And then then now everyone's afraid to step up like Elon, that that thought is that someone would ever get together, conspire to do that, to control people in the world.  The new world order right now. That's what I was just talking about 15 minutes ago.  We're in the new world order drilling, derailing the coverage. Your your I try to help you out. I know you don't think that's interesting. That's interesting. Isn't that interesting into it? What if he opens this plant and then there's all this Carondelet? I think I think I hope I'm wrong. I think he's the captain of Team Freedom and I hope I'm wrong.  You've got to listen to his words and see what his actions are. He a lot of deceit going on, Eddie, against the government of California.  Open up his plant since day one. He said, if you're going to arrest someone, arrest me. If you think that this some three way game, it's ridiculous. The guy invests all his own money in his businesses.  He's going to talk about a guy like you, get some subsidies for a million millions. But that's also the most.  Think about who's who on the planet is more innovative than that guy. The guy is doing crazy shit, man.  I mean, he's freedom in order to do three or four different realms. He's digging tunnels to Vegas. He's shooting rockets into space. He's making the most insane electric cars.  Look, I've talked to the guy a few times. I said, super, I hope he's ready. Bravo. He's a fucking super genius. They exist, I hope.  And that's what he is. I'm not a genius. I'm not saying true. I hope he's really on team freedom. Don't beat out that. He's Rick from Rick. And I feel guilty to tell me all of his worldly possessions.  He's selling all of his houses. And you know why. So people can't talk to you, go, oh, you live like that, but you live there. You own this. He's a he's a real legit. I hope he's on team freedom. A billion on top of this. I hope I'm wrong.  That is he is he is he moving to Texas? He's going to move one of his plants.  No, he's not anymore. Because they're not because they they they bent the need to take this thing. They bet the Nito man and he's opening up now because you what you want to do that I'm the fuck out there. Oh, OK. You can have some people, not all people. All right, we'll stay.  I understand if people have bad immune systems, we should let them stay home. Of course, I understand.  If people are old, we should take care. Then we should come in contact with that. We should watch. But you can't hide forever.  And I don't know when is a good idea for us to come out, but I do think, and with my limited understanding of really limited, limited understanding of your scientists, basically scientists and economics, I would imagine that if no one's making any fucking money that the economy is sliding further and further away from homeostasis every goddamn today and every fucking.  And I think Gavin Newsom of San Francisco on the ground, there's human poo every day.  There's no way it's Gavin Newsom going to win California. He's taking a real chance. They're taking a real gamble. Man. That's Mike Garcia. He's a Republican, won the Twenty Fifth District, and he's coming one times. Get hard people. When she won by when times get Harlette, people flipping flip, they go, hey, they're going to turn the state. Do you look do you what percentage has the people who you can count on when the chips are down, what percentage has the people with the character, what percentage of the people who can rise to the occasion physically and you just try to figure out which team you're on it for some people, for the longest time it was the liberals because they felt like, look, it's really important to have freedom of speech.  It's really important that freedom of expression, it's really important to let people be who they are and be open minded and to be more compassionate and try to give to others. But that doesn't take into account human nature. And that's where a right wing person is. That's the appeal of being a right wing person like you're giving up. And I'm not quite ready to give up. No, I can't.  We have can we have can I be or can we have a party that is pro-choice, pro gay rights, pro-gun, pro pro-gun weight. Forget it. Pro gun. How about just pro-gay rights, pro-choice, pro legalizing drugs? Republicans.  Yes, it's just a Republican is the problem is that we only have two choices. I know what our kids know. There's a libertarian.  I know, but I voted for Gary Johnson. But when you say it, everybody's like, oh, you. And you know what, let me ask your question, Brian, you know, isn't there like a morning after pill, like if you if you Ratdog a chick and and she she can take a morning.  Yes. Plan B, plan B, son of a bitch, which is a legit you know, it's the CIA supply.  So here's the question. Why does abortion still exist?  Well, because some people don't know they're pregnant. Three. What? But but the whole pro-choice thing, the big giant part of it is rape.  Like someone gets raped.  Like if you get raped and you didn't want to be part of the argument, you put that there should abortion should not be exist. Just if you get if you get fucked raw dog and you don't want to have a kid, don't say, well, let me think about it for fucking six months. Well, I decide the next day, take the pill.  I'm pro-choice, so I don't want to get into this because this is a weed. I see.  But do you see my point that abortion should not even exist? Points have all been made many times like. And how does it still exist all the way up to the Supreme Court? Because here's the thing.  When someone it's their body and something happens inside their body, it's making a person. At what point in time are you OK with it?  And this is the this is the most messy part of that consciousness.  Take the plan B should be required. Don't want abortion. Just Plan B if you don't get plan B, plan B, there's no question. That's it. That's it. Right. OK, Eddie, stop it.  Because what if you don't want to do that and you don't know and then you've got to have it. You have when do you have to make up your mind when you're a twenty year old right away you try to make up your mind.  It's a fucking it's a hard question to ask a person.  So I'm done with that. I'm done with that. Let's change the subject of this. Right. But in this case, it's at a certain point to talk about Jesus or anything at a certain point in time. It's different, right? Like that's where abortion is. The craziest is like when it's one. So are you OK with it? OK, get rid of it. What? It's five cells. OK, quick, quick.  Get rid of it now. When it's fifty one, it's a million cells. It's a million cells. How big is it. You can barely see it. Why that's a million cells.  When the big question they ask abortion rights activists is how do you feel about a fetus about eight months ago? And then it becomes a question Hannity asked. Hannity asked de Blasio that and de Blasio is like, I'm not getting into that.  I just you have to get into it. Well, see, it's it's so politically viable. Third trimester. Oh, my. So the third trimester, you couldn't, you know, I believe. Right. Jamie looked it up.  I think the third trimester, we probably should watch this fight because this is about to be Dan EGA versus Edson Barbosa. Barbosa, to my knowledge, at least in the UFC, has never fought at forty five before. I think this is his first fight at forty five after Gadge, right?  Yes. Yes. Gages last Jayjay stopped. Was that his last fight. I don't know.  It was either that or the Dan Hangmen fight. He had a killer fight with Dan Hangmen Paul Felder.  It was Paul Felder before that. Oh that's right. Felda beat him. Right. And he was Dan Hangmen before that.  As Felder Felter, you, then Dan Hooker is a beast man, and they had a war, Dan Hooker still one of the most dangerous guys he's built.  So strange. So is Paul Felder, by the way. Oh, super dangerous. I mean, that fight was down to the wire between hooker and felt it was an amazing fight.  Unbelievable. And a great you know. Yeah.  It seemed like he was thinking about quitting afterwards. I haven't talked to him about it.  And I hope we get out of a lot of punishment.  Ken, how quick Barbosa is. Forty five minutes have been cut for him. I thought he was edging that fight, Paul Felder. Me, too, but the take down the final rounds like.  It's takedowns are interesting, right? Yeah, they're so valuable and sometimes, well, if you decide if you can do something. Yeah, but in terms of like how the judges. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. He gave him trouble.  Barbosa Crouse worried about to forty five to men maybe at forty.  He has tremendous power. He looks crisp too. He, he had he was all right. Yeah. Oh he looks like in Brazilian skeleton covered in skin.  This is the thing that we were talking about earlier. It's like this is the weird part of this, this sport is that someone like Barbosa can be one forty five for a really brief amount of time fight completely shredded.  Yeah. He probably. What do you think he weighs now.  160. Yeah, probably 160 ish.  Sixty two. Something like that. Completely shredded. Oh my God.  He's so fast. Yeah I like that. Oh dude. He's so dangerous that at forty five because he's been used to fighting those big fellows.  It's true. I mean some of those fifty five that he fought so big man.  Hey who's with me to start to go fund me for Francis first John Jones. Because John wants too much money. But the thing was shot to go fund me because there's no fans. I don't know if John wants too much money. That's a rumor, sir.  No, I'm just saying, if you're going to put that fight together, it's going to cost a lot of money. We are starting to go fund me. Nobody said, look, John and John back and forth.  If I was smart and if I was them, I would wait until you go somewhere where they can have a crowd in the audience, Floridas, and be able to have I mean, Florida, they're talking about having NFL games.  They're NBA games with audiences, with NFL said we're not going to go no fans. We're going to do limited fans, but we're going to have fans. And ifl don't fuck around the lifeline to America, everything shut down.  The NFL is not immune. Like when is it there? I mean, I don't know my dad coming.  So it's called our Dana White fucking with his attitude. I'm against New York Times. I fuck all my favorite people. Right, man, I'm a big fan right now.  Yeah, they they wanted him to not do it. And I'm like, well, they're protecting everybody. They're testing everybody. They even found one guy and it's his corner man had it too, right. Yeah.  Two cornerman, two cornerman because a family member has had it.  And then it came to he looked at much bigger Barbossa than two and he gay is an explosive dude. He's he's really coming up in the ranks.  This is a big fight from big test, real dangerous. Got real good ground game too. He is a beast.  It's not an easy fight for to know, especially if this is if I. Yeah, I mean, this is a wake up wears him out. I mean, it is tough out due to how bad ass the UFC to go.  Oh, cool. There's this pandemic going on. Hey, listen, we put some fights on Fox. Yes.  Listen, do you know the only reason it got stopped in California is because fucking some of the media called in and complained and got the news on the news.  Oh, new song was the one that finally shut it down. Finally hit them enough already that did it, man.  Well, I think they said that the president of Disney called up Welker's Nuzum knows him, called him, and that was the final straw. And then Disney was like, yeah, that's crazy.  We're never going get into cable, show you where is he? Because we're in for a while. Isn't Gavin Newsom, Pelosi's son in law?  Correct. Oh, my gosh.  Crazy. I love Pelosi. Right. She's the best person.  I don't believe the guy. Gavin Newsom believes anything he says. I think he's just ambitious, just like our said, I'm sure ambitious.  They want to be president. He's a bad person. I want to be a bad dude.  It's so weird that it's so weird that we are popularity contests still. That's what we do on twenty popularity contests to control everything.  And some people look so fake and you get mad that other people aren't seeing it. Like you don't hear this robot bullshit. It's coming out of guys.  How about Biden about to die? You're crazy.  If you don't think if you think they're going to switch someone out with Biden, he's like, no, no, he is not going to there's going to be going to be on the cards. He's not going to be setting it up. There's no way Hillary story is going to come in.  Yeah, like a fucking Criss Angel show in Vegas coming over the wires. Look at the convention with angel wings on. And she's like, highlighter here, bitches. And everybody's going to go, yeah, please give me a running mate, Michelle Obama.  She would win. She would win. Michelle, no Trump. No way. Hillary and Michelle Obama beat Trump. They would knock it out of the park. Who would you vote for? Who would you vote for?  Oh, my God. If you had to vote hypothetically, gun to your head. I don't have a gun to my head. Don't put that. You can't even you can't even say Trump with the hypothetical.  It just makes such waves when Joe says it's going to be the first time I thought it was going to be voted ever in my life. Go to prom first time. Right, Brian. But who would you vote for between Hillary and Trump at this moment? I will cut you if you like. Moment. I can't believe I'm saying it. Donald Trump. Yeah, I could believe your intelligence, you give me a chance, because between Trump and Biden, again, I can't believe I'm saying it can't believe I'm saying it because I don't I don't trust that Trump is doing everything to end this lockdown.  I'm with that motherfucker.  Look, I just I just 100 percent I just think the left has lost their way. That's what I think their minds do. Dated before mass. Right. I agree with you. I'm a moderate person. I'm not. I am too. I well, I'm not a bad motherfucker, dude.  Trump is a bad man. He's going to go down as the greatest president of all time with some people.  But that's why it's a greatest contest. You know, it's like everybody has to pick. Some people don't even think MJ is the greatest basketball player of all time.  In your opinion, the way the way he calls out the fake the fake news media.  Oh, my God. Oh, my God.  That's my favorite. I just love watching outtakes of him. Just rolling news.  Barbosa has a big swelling.  He's like our boss has taken a lot of party.  To your point, I only watch the news now. I don't believe any all of it's a piece of just propaganda.  It's almost like I mean, come on, man. You watch every conflict. Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo. Come on, man.  Come on, man. Just listen to them talk, right? It's all deception. Well, it's I see it ends up fucking. How do you get there? It's almost like that's what the game grooms you into being. Are you guys watching?  They were always like this, what you're saying, but they weren't always like this.  It's a hell of a fight. Yeah, they were. They were always it was always nice to know.  OK, you just didn't notice. Ryan, you act like the show's called fake campaign. Let's get back to the second round.  That's yeah. It's the second round, but EGA just took it over. Holy shit too. That's what I'm saying. Like he is it tough out.  But also for those that come that way the later rounds would affect. Right.  And Barbosa with that big power that's all that fast twitch. Has he thrown a wheel. Kick it.  Nobody's finding it.  Finding spot. Oh Iggy's coming on strong. He usually can't take the same shot and gets used to making this way he goes it's his world.  But on the flip side, he's got more power. Barbosa He's got power now, but nobody if he's back to years. Yes. Remember how Corner had all that power. Forty five and then a fifty five. It kind of it wasn't as powerful. Right. Right.  I think you have to like it back to don't think Barbosa when he gets down to forty five is as strong as Barbro is at fifty five he's losing something.  It's impossible. It'd be impossible. He's losing something that's cutting down.  Yeah. Wow. Can he make it. He says he can to one twenty five.  Yeah. That's like that scene in Vision Quest with Matthew Modine. He's going to go down and wait the rest of the shoot.  Can you make it. Can you make the wait. It's so fucking talented. Remember that scene vision.  Some young dude I love that movie you never saw. It was the greatest wrestling inspiration movie of all time. Really in question time. What year is that? Five. Jamie, have you seen it? We're no no native grow so many, so many old school wrestlers. That was their movie. They would watch that movie and then go work out.  That was a movie. It was the greatest. It was like, there's something like this. Here's the thing.  I was never a good wrestler, only wrestler for one year. But what they showed in that movie was the closest wrestling.  Well, that's cool.  It's ever existed in a big time movie with a movie star that Foxcatcher. No, it's all about this really fucking smart kid who becomes obsessed with wrestling.  I want to beat this guy. He wants to be shoot.  And then his friend, his friend who pretends he's Native American. It was like the first cultural appropriation seen as a great ever.  You guys, a great actor. Matthew Modine is a beast. When the guy until recently, the guy who plays his friend who pretends to be Native American, the black breaks don't know. The other guy is Forest Whitaker. Right. There is a Forest Whitaker forced to do. That is a great movie.  He's one of the greats. I mean, that white Modiin is spectacular in that movie. He's great. But in that movie, he's so believable. Look at shoot.  Going to be really the guy has to be. Yeah, this is absolute deficit. What the fuck the guy's like. He's tall, I believe, much more than this. Yeah. No, no, no. I'm telling you man, Matthew Modine moves like a wrestler really to. He did. But this guy was his ass though, right. Otherwise I'm not watching it.  No, I'm not telling you what your purpose is getting worked. Hey, man, you don't have to be like super fucking strong person like me.  You'd have to look like one of those guys to be really good looking at me.  You're right. You've tangled with me. There's things about guys, brother guys are really technical or surprising. Like there's guys that are really technical that have like a significant strength, does it not?  I mean, look at that. That's good. Yeah, I thing bull. Thank you. Perfect Surfest. Perfect example. If it's. Yeah.  I mean take aspirin would ragdoll people and if you looked at them you would never believe it. You know.  Shit. He's got to go to Vegas. No, no doubt. He would mock his own body. Yeah, he did. I'm not saying that he didn't say on flip flops everywhere. I feel like we got him in the UFC, but we love it. I do love Ben.  I want to talk to him again. Should think we talked about him coming in and talking about this is a marijuana cough, in case you're wondering.  Ladies and gentlemen, I'm Brian you.  And this is a cold cough, in case you're wondering.  But, yeah, his his experience was very unique. The most there's so much pressure later.  Really bad hip, like a really bad script.  So how about hip surgery? But then also, you know, been asked to talk about politics. I don't know if you follow him on Twitter. Yeah, he's great. Yeah, he's he's one of us when it comes that he believes the same things. He believes in liberty. He's every constitution. He's America.  He's a Ron Paul guy. Yeah. Yeah. It's you know, it's interesting, man. There's different philosophies on how we should run this country and how we should exist as a culture. And, you know, everybody thinks they're doing the right thing. And that's where I think that people get the most things.  The Democrats, the liberals that want to keep the city shut down, they think they're doing the right thing.  I disagree. But then there's an agenda. The government I'm talking about, the people that support it, totally brainwashed.  I think they're doing the right thing. I really do believe that because they're scared of the propaganda. They're scared that they got them with the fear propagating my problem and saying it's OK.  That's not the reason. But it's a couple things. It's a couple things.  It's one, the the worst case scenario that we prepared for, it didn't turn out to be true. So it's less than that. That's right. But I think that's lucky.  But no, but now. Yeah, I guess that's open up. But either way, what do they say whether the Democrats say wait till the summer to that surge? Yeah.  You know, there's a problem. There's a big problem. Let me tell you what's right. Where is it that here's the problem. Here's the problem.  I know people that are getting way fucking more on unemployment rate for their job.  That's a great point. Huge.  General, I work I got some friends are like, dude, I want this to go on and on. Those are the guys that are commenting like, dude, what about old people?  You don't have all heard? And he's right. I got to deal with that. And he's right.  US you're getting a lot of people getting unemployment. I know that. Yeah, I do know that. And I'm like, motherfucker, no wonder.  No wonder you're on the fucking chat supporting this shit.  I have other family members like, would you shut the fuck up? I don't have to go to work, dude. I'm getting bank. Oh, my God. So I know a couple of people like that. Yeah, it's so ridiculous. A lot of people like that.  That's the problem with socialism right there. Right? That's it. That's right.  It's in a nutshell, I always say to people like socialism, I say, so how much of your day do you want to spend working for someone else? So do you believe in eighty percent taxes? Seventy five percent. So seventy five percent of your day is dedicated to working for someone else. You're giving that money away and then you keep twenty five. You know what's going on. You when you, when you do it that way, which is what we're talking about really.  Eighty percent in a true socialist.  You know what's incredible about socialist people love socialism because they think they're getting free education, they think they're getting free health, they think they're getting everything free.  It's a fucking it. Nobody's getting nothing for fucking free.  You know, we can't even stop. We can't we can't even we can't even get free water Americans. We can't even get free water. We have to pay. We got the ocean right next to us. We got droughts in California, but we can't figure out how to take sea water. Oh, it's too expensive. Oh, it's too hard. We can't make the water drinkable. It's not how I talk to you.  I have a list. Come on, think about that. We can't figure it. Check this out. Bill Caterpiller, my special about that. OK, I'm sorry. Revved up Bill Gates has a factory that can take oh shit sewage and turn it into drinking water. Thank God there's a video.  There's a video. You can take a listen. How about leaving the shit out? You just take regular seawater. We drink that. They can't figure out seawater, dude. They can't figure that out. No, that's not true. They have desalination. I'm not sure exactly why it was the drought did not efficient to expand. But you know what they're doing. They can't figure it out. No, they can.  But they they're not sending the biggest ocean right back to you. It's just too expensive. Wouldn't it be crazy, though?  All bullshit aside, wouldn't it be crazy if we did turn to the ocean for our water and just started draining that motherfucker?  I just realized I realized how great we realize how the ocean we really are.  Did we, like, realize like killing dolphins, whales flopping around, like to stop people thinking they're going to get free health card in people thinking they're going to get free health care, free education.  Dude, you're going to pay in some way. You're going to pay. You guys win this fight so far, this is a government and the government said, OK, we're going to pay more in the sky. What if the government if they all got to go to Congress and go, OK, we're going to take a percentage of our paychecks and pay for your shit like like the government is paying for it.  That's free. That's free. But is Newsom taking a cut and all this right now know he's not getting paid?  He wouldn't do that. No, no, no, no. He's got to. No, no, he's not getting paid. I don't know who's getting paid on unemployment. I would I would imagine everyone else take him out of his unemployment check is like fucking one hundred and fifty thousand dollars a week.  How much money you make being governor? You make that much. He's worth ten, but you make way more in unemployment. That's the income. But that's why everyone's cool with it. So we're a diaper on my e-mail.  He's worked hard. Now he's on the bank, that handsome fellow tea as good looking guy.  He's the reason I'm jealous of good looking guy. Oh, got a nice head of hair. I know he does really good almost to the side. I mean, I don't I wouldn't want to be him. I wouldn't want to be the person that decides when and how to open it back up, because there's a lot of people that are hysterical that don't want it to be open. Back up to you on this. We have to take this in a category called Communists God.  But I just don't understand. There's a lot of fear involved. This is technical.  There's people like us. And then there's there's a bunch of people that are scared and that don't agree with us. So let them stay here. But the reality is you kind of have to listen to them, too.  If we have a civilized society for the of jungle, OK, that's one of the problems we're having right now, is that no one wants to be open to the other side having a point.  OK, OK. The other day on your podcast, you guys talked about you brought it up just recently within three or four days, you'd looked over at Jamie and you said, what's the average age at this point? What is the average age?  One is higher, higher than the average age that people normally die.  Shouldn't the correct Rachamim right? It's you should should average age seventy nine. Should the lockdown be based on logic or or not? It should absolutely be based on logic.  OK, but if the averages would be nice to people like I had a great relationship with my grandfather, I lived with him when I was in New Jersey, when I, when I moved up there, when I was I guess it was 23 or 24 when I left Boston.  I guess I was twenty four somewhere around that. And I lived with my grandfather. My grandfather took me fishing. I kind of I didn't really grow up with my dad after I was like seven years old. So my relationship with, like an older man other than my stepfather was my grandfather. I did a lot of stuff with him.  Yeah. And I love my grandpa. Too many priests. But but the reality is, if I knew that there was something that could kill my grandfather and I could keep it from him and protect him in his house and get him food, of course. But the ones that I've been made sure that I've been checked and then make sure that no one comes around him that's sick and coughing. One hundred percent sure. But those people, I feel, are the people that we need to protect instead of the opposite gross approach of locking down all the healthy people and saying don't move.  OK, so vast majority of the members don't the numbers don't support that kind of drug.  But and also you can't decide whether or not other people take chances and you can say, well, you're going to spread that to other people. Yet this is a part of being people. That's right. And we can't just deny that because we deny that for this, it's a goddamn slippery slope. OK, we take the measures that we can take. We do the best that we can to protect people that are vulnerable.  But that should be the focus of our attention, not stopping society until there's a cure. No vaccination. We don't have a vaccination for the flu, motherfuckers.  We're not going to we have to. Oh, you guys got to take this fucking Bill Gates vaccine if he comes up with you guys. I'm not Bill Gates. This country more.  You know, the business is the other business.  I thought he didn't answer my questions.  Brian, my question to you is, Joe, Joe had a story about his grandfather and protecting the elderly. I understand that. I want to my mom is seventy four.  I get it. But my question I'd rather have is open. Why is the empathy so selective? It's because every year for the last hundred years, a bunch of old people die of the flu every year, but they are completely ignored. But now that we put the spotlight on covid now it's like, but dude, they're old and we got to take care of them. Yes, the exact same numbers for the flu.  Every year, every day you've been alive. Old people have been dying of the flu. They've been at the exact same thing. Isn't it a coincidence that covid the exact same symptoms, the exact same age of death, the exact same age of death? Everything's the exact same. But why why are we selective about on our empathy? Why, why?  Why this time? I think it's forcing us to be aware of something that we didn't take into consideration. The people the people are dying from diseases all the time.  When something is one scale above what we're used to, people panic. And this is several scales up above a flu. Right. If you look at a normal flu season where everybody's mingling now we're talking about numbers, the numbers are bad before those numbers are bad. But let's let's let's assume for a second a bad flu season is like 60. And this we haven't gotten through this. Right. So this is still going on. People are dying every day.  It seems to have dropped off in a lot of places. But but hold on. We're over it.  Eighty thousand numbers are OK. But how many of those do you think are off the up? Dude, dude, how are they? Get it off office.  Fuck like office do therefore instead of or off instead.  How about look at like this. What about it as a contributing factor. Now hold on. So we know that people die of covid.  Right. So if you are sick with something else and you get covid, I mean it's a contributing factor to your death. It's not the only factor. But to not list it would be just as disingenuous as listing it as the only cause. Yes. Yeah, but we're we're looking at it as a covid death or should be like a little asterisks. Exactly. Why.  Also, why doesn't the media report that it's so it's just it's because it's an ideology now. So there's a fight. It's the fight of control of what is happening. Do we need to keep people locked down? Is this never going to go away? Is a lock down until twenty twenty two or is it recognizing what would it actually the people that are OK with this lockdown don't have anything to lose.  It's crazy.  The problem with this is the lockdown is based in Tirelli on numbers, projections and graphs. Right.  What really once, once, once it's proven, they're padding the numbers, they're inflating the numbers, they're forging death certificates, which I think there are right now.  We know for this way if this was in court, if this was in court, once they got to that point, they're like, oh, this motherfucker out there would throw the fuck out of the court in an instant if once they start proving the true numbers, but the numbers are are forged, which just means brusquely doing a two finger push up sun.  He's doing a 30 for 30 on and I was crazy for 30 unbruised to him and Lance Armstrong. I want to see that blindfolded. I can't wait for the Lance Armstrong one blindfold, so I'm excited for the Brucey one. Oh, yes. It's weird. I know. That's strange. I know.  I wonder Lance Armstrong, when we was about for him. I get it. I know. But no one I like is the innovator in terms of, like, contributing different this. I know he's fantastic moves from different styles. He's fantastic.  But when I was a kid, Bruce Lee was the Blue Falcon. What, you guys are missing the spread. Brian brought the cheese in this case a little out of control. You know, it's crazy how much better technique is now than during the Bruce Lee days.  Brandon, how long does Bruce Lee last with you in the Arctic? How dare you? So and so's a tiny fellow. But the point is, it's interesting.  Even when you watch him throw kicks and stuff, like even throwing stuff, he does things.  Look at Jackie Robinson in a way that Barbosa would kick his face. Oh, my God, it wouldn't even be close now.  Barbosa kick his fucking leg.  But it's so different when you look at people from his era where he was, like, truly exceptional.  Yeah. Like you have. But he never thought he was special on his mind, especially once. Yeah, those don't count. He was never in a room. He was really.  No, no, not really. No, you're right. But he he's a contributor nonetheless in a way that's like really significant. He's a pioneer. He tried it and tested it on people. Brilliant. He's really gotten a lot of street fights. Yeah. He had real fights in a real fight. He finally catered his big John about to save you, you know what I mean? He was out on the Hill, QLogic. Adelia This should be wild fun.  Street kludges. Cute.  She looks that's. Do you not follow her on Instagram? No. Sure.  Instagram schwing. Really? Because she looked first team. All Brazilians. Sorry, guys. She's she just had some surgery. Did she had surgery on like some kind of.  I don't know. She looks great. Yeah she doesn't. She looks like she's had some mammograms and you've had Angela Hill on here, right. Yes, she's great. She's hilarious man. She's hilarious. Online to Angela Hill's a good follow. Oh. UFC face mask.  Yeah. That was the funniest thing you ever fucking said that. Well, that's. No, no, no, no, no, no, no. Not the funny top. Twenty five. No, not twenty five, Larry. He said some funny shit. That's that's.  How about being Kalani going back on the road. We're the canaries in the tunnel like dude vitamines. Did you guys. Another question.  OK, let's say Donald Trump just said said I'm going to fucking make an announcement, we're going to have one comedy tour and just one.  And they wanted to put you guys in the comedy tour. And Trump said, we talking about, would you do it?  Would you jump out of that? I know I don't do anything for anybody like that. No, no. I'm not doing any shows. Why?  No, no. Like, as the first shows, this is going to break down the barriers for comedy shows. Donald Trump. No, no, no.  I can't give you. You guys are doing it, what you don't need to be given the freedom that we can't just do a concert right now. No. To allow you. Donald Trump said, I'm going to allow you this one tour, full stadiums, one tour.  Joe's not in. Are you able to breathe underwater? Are you in are you in Yemen well-being, Brian?  I can do it. I can't. Can I bring myself to doing it? Because when I look at Brian Tucker's knife. I'm sorry.  That would be the best tour ever did. Donald Trump approved. You guys can fill stadiums. How crazy would that be?  Hey, bro, what's up? Is there a problem? That's like you. You're just so tired, like your pizzeria worker tank Top Chef. That's my secret. I don't like pizza.  Real architects like your Old Navy Masters Division TOF. I was in my own private gym wearing a tank top and I was embarrassed.  You were on private gym working out by myself like I own one tank top. Is that all that? Oh, you guys follow Donald Trump Jr..  No, you guys don't follow Donald Trump, Junior. And what you're changing the subject, which is for sure fun.  No, I thought for sure you guys followed him. No, you should.  On Instagram, followed by 20 or so gangster, the shit he posted today.  Oh, my God. He's a beast. He's a fucking beast on the Internet. Holy shit. Follow. Follow Donald Trump.  So something crazy about Joe Biden, like some meme of Joe Biden after a while, pedophile ceiling or something like that.  He does hard.  Yeah, that's hard, you know, but that's a crazy thing to even you about. That's why I brought it up like that.  Savage. That's a crazy savage.  But it's crazy that we're at this point where we were I was with Bridget Fennessy yesterday and she was talking about this.  Congresswoman, was it what does she do, Representative? The lady said, fuck Trump or fuck Elon Musk, brother.  Fuck Elon Musk, who said I fuck her over if she said what she should say. So she just went with, like, the crazy statement.  But what we found fascinating yesterday, we were talking we were like, imagine at any other time people saying something like that, no one was ever safe. Fuck Ronald Reagan. No, I can't do that.  Dude would say no congressperson or senator or representative with no representative would ever get on a public forum like Twitter never and write fuck, you know, but but listen, listen.  But when you have the thick stream media for the last three years trying, I thought it was a little stream. It's fake story. Didn't have too many fake stream to be suspicious of people trying to reinvent themselves with new nicknames.  If the fake stream media decided to attack you and smear you and fucking connect you with all this crazy shit, will, it's not planning on doing what they did.  You would come out with a vengeance.  That's what's going on. We all just be friends. Dude, I'm just stating facts.  You're kind of aggressive right now. Hey. Hey, boys. How long before the provin factor?  The fake stream media has been crushing Donald Trump, trying to ruin his life and the lives of his family, his good since day one. Of course he's like that. OK, I know people. They're like, oh, I hate him. Why does he have to be such an asshole? He's such an asshole. I'm like, dude, they're trying to ruin him on a daily basis. You put on every day I take a shit I put on my phone and there's a headline.  Trump is a fucking asshole. Every fucking day I take a shit if it's the same one. Trump is a fucking asshole. Every day you're shouting too loud. We can't do it like this. You're talking to us. OK, I get it.  I know people who know people. Hey, we can't fucking do anything.  We're just sitting here. You yelling about Trump. I want to watch some stating it's your opinion. That's a fact. What I just said. OK, I said facts.  I bet your your but if you're coming in hard in the paint and I'm feeling a little sensitive today, OK, you're still a little blue, you're still a little blue, you know, and your little by little, inch by inch. Someone answer my door right now. Everybody shout a little fucking passionate about I'm in the middle of the New World Order right now.  Store.  We should be back. When are we back doing stand up at this spot? I had a guess. I don't think there's going to be a show that's open until around August ish.  If I had to guess, I text Emily and I don't want any any news. No one knows she was just being a heartbreaker.  How about this? This is a very dangerous time because you could ramp up testing. It's possible to ramp up testing and some innovative person could figure out a fucking app, OK?  And you could delete it when you want it, when you don't want it anymore. But this app lets you know the fact that you've taken something, you know, taking a test, that you've done it in X amount of days. Like we do it every two days, every three days, whatever it is, just let us go back to work. If you have you get a new barcode every time you test positive. And then we recognize the number of positives.  So or some shit that we. Eighty year old died over some shit. When you talk about testing, testing, testing, you have to do something to test this. Got to be players. There's got to be ways to protect people other than just shutting everything down. There's got to be innovative solutions to let people go back there and be careful.  And they know about what's not. What I worry about. They know I worry about. Contact tracing through your phones. Yes. Dangerous drones that are watching people when they congregate.  That's what I was saying, like tracing fucked at the bet.  The best thing to do to maintain both freedom and safety is to have an app. You fucking checked in every X amount of days while the shit is bullshit and we figure it out.  80 year olds with pre-existing conditions, just like the flu. We're going to do what we know that we know. Kills. Test, test.  Test. Test, test. Test. Test. Test for what? Test. Testosterone test. Jesus Christ control.  The bottom line is this. I worry about things. A flat like immunity papers you have to carry around contact tracing where they can trace you on your phone with who? You been with the private.  Private. It's a precedent that's dangerous because then what if we've got a particularly stiff flu or what if they exaggerate the flu?  Of course, they pretend they can use it for. You know what if they say they're worried that this flu could be twice as bad as cold? That's right. And then they wish now that they know it works, they can shut it down. Hey, Gary, tell me, those UFOs that they were actually drones, Russian and China drones, they think. Did you hear that, judge ones?  Well, I think you watch David Frazier ones they found in fucking San Diego that went from like 60 feet above the water, drones on drones in a second.  Drones, Joe, now Venezuela, Russia, they don't even know what the propulsion system of these things, what the government told us did to listen that just like your mother fuckers, you're coming after us for this bullshit.  You guys are doing the same shit. If that is a drone, if that is a drone that Commander Fraser saw that's off the coast of San Diego where they scrambled to go meet this thing, it was hovering over the water. It moves so fast they could barely track Chinese drone violated all sorts of laws, compulsion and speed, not necessarily aliens.  It could be they don't know what the fuck it is. But here's the thing. The people that are at the front of the line of propulsion don't understand it. What is this? Why this? This is why it's confusing. The only way they'd be able to make this in secret scientists, the way they work is one scientist. Paper influence is the work of another scientist. They figure things out together. They're all in coordination because they have to exchange information because one guy can't be the fucking guy who lives in the middle of the mountain.  That's a super genius like in ex machina, who makes his own people and no one else is aware in the real world, like the scientists all work with a bunch of other scientists do. Yeah. So there's there's not going to be a thing that just sneaks up on someone that's that monumental work just gets built and all of them are like, what the fuck.  Yeah, but am I going batshit crazy or didn't they tell us was I said, okay, listen man, those things were moving in a way that they don't understand the last people.  Good point. But the people that understand propulsion know that there's got to be something that makes them go. There's no heat signature.  Yeah, there's no there's for when you have that container and they were tracing it, they're tracing it on radar. Yeah. They don't see anything.  All these different maybe holograms have come up on different weapons systems that they used to lock in on physical targets.  She doesn't even come and it moves on radar faster than the gravity of this thing. Elon Musk's infrared video star didn't talk to him about it.  How do you do it? I wish I did.  Now that you brought up, I feel like I fucked up to tell you. Why didn't I ask him? You know? No, you're right. He probably has his own weirdo theater or I got you. I have one of those drones, Joe.  It's probably here and there, but here next, that's what he does. Instead of sleeping.  Yes, he has to pretend to be sleeping with, you know, they sold more of those those small tussles than M3, BMW in America.  Well, it's an amazing car. You know, the three series, especially the what does that performance model. The sport model.  Yeah. Love it. It's an insane car. I love it. You don't have a warrant. That's the right size to the right side. But mine is really this is a very good fire fight. Yeah.  Let's you know, I got I got allocated I got on the VIP list for the new Bronco drops in October and the top comes off. Well, my bike's back there. My shirt off. Yeah. Let me see a picture like I want that to show Jimmy. That's a legit picture of the new seller.  It got leaked from the Ford factory. Your boys on the VIP list. Oh, my God. I'm getting white it juice. It's not a big deal. Could move.  I want one broncos'. I'm making a comeback. How much are they about why I get so patriotic when it comes to cars?  They need to make an O.J. signature Bronco O.J. signature. It's money. Everybody wins.  I know that. That's it. Oh my God. Is that real? I saw that from the factory.  Oh my God. That's from or I want that. This is it.  This isn't the roof comes prototype. Yes. To Dorson.  That's the four door you're pulling out the two door. Go back up again. Your is why he had his. Jamie, please and please. No. I'm looking at it that I train for. That's the four doors, there are two doors. They have a picture of the ceiling. Angela Hill thrown down two or four door. That's just beautiful.  How do you know? Angela Hill fought in the UFC after four years of training.  OK, she had no exercise. She wasn't doing jack shit and she was getting a little bit chubby, she said. So she decided to go to a Mutai gym. Four years later, she's in the UFC undefeated as a kickboxer.  And I'm going to say I'm going to say, hold my cheddar cheese. I was in the UFC after two years of training. True fighting right now.  Listen, I know you were. I know you were. I'm not I'm not trying to trump it right here. I don't want credit. But here's the thing.  Like you're seeing her fight at a world class level, literally, like I mean, here we are now. I want to know how many years it's been since she first got into the UFC. I think that was the first time I saw her fight was at altitude in Mexico City. I believe.  I want to say, look, that tutorage comes on. That's point is on the list. That's a stunning looking car.  Fucking car man who.  They nailed it. They just nailed it. They they. Oh, you guys like you. The restoration. OK, we got it.  Yeah. I want that fucking car. Yeah. That's like an icon but like a modern version. It's basically like an icon.  Brought a great car, real sober boy. You're going to be on the first ones.  Am I like I get oddly patriotic when it comes to car.  Yes, I get very excited. Now you're not going to like why I'm doing this to us. I don't like it already.  You don't like until you get the clinch on Angela Hill. Let's see what happens here. Ajibade, Takasu technique such.  But you know me man.  I don't I don't know shit until he hits the ground double under Hooke's though. What's your strategy on getting it to the ground. What would you trade trying them in. All right. Oh it's a kludge.  See how she could. What's kludges. Jujitsu game like she's blackbelt. Yeah, but have you seen her submit anybody? I'm trying to remember. I can't remember.  But she's had some great Schnatter wars with Yohana. Man, isn't it a little weird, though, that he's get in this fight and Claudia's No.6?  Well, I think Angela just fought and won really recently. Yeah, she's been super active.  She was on the last card, the one that once in New Zealand Hill is that I don't know if that was the last one. I say that right.  Because look at the way she's fucking, like, stopping could do it.  She's got to look at how good she is for the small amount of time she's been doing this. She just keeps getting better.  She's going to be on three years. Oh, yeah. She's exactly the same with you know, she's funny, too, man.  She was funny on the podcast. She's really smart. I'm a fan of the big take down by Cordelia.  That's a black belt in jujitsu right there inside control. It's pressure and she could be in it while I see Werneck one minute and back.  She could get if you just monitor, throw some punches, just get gift wrapped her and take her back trying to hold her back. And that would be the thing.  The belly mount ponche gift wrap people. The back Chope. You got a minute? You got to go now. You can't stay inside of control right now.  You've got to mount or, you know, a camera. Right. There might be. All right. I think she's got to make a move. She just can't stay. They don't just control or inside control.  Yeah, this is their opportunity this round and they stand up. The next round she gets knocked out would be like, oh, my God. You look back at this table, that book. I said, amount of this after tonight.  What's the next big fight? What's the next big pay per view? I think what is next weekend? But there's nothing really. I think there's one every week.  What's next weekend? But we're going to become a barbaric society, no sports other than the UFC. I know everybody's broke. Well, you might know, but it might be tough to get on a plane. Eddie, Jesus Christ.  This might be the greatest moment ever for, like, a fucking the birth of your arms.  Oh, I said are close to 50. I'm standing on standing up.  Oh, Amanda Nunez and Felicia Spencer. That's the next one. June 6th.  They are not charging me money for this. That's June 6th. There's no way they're asking me for money.  How dare you? Joe says, I'm going to look at that card I didn't see. I love Amanda. She's like the dough.  Let's put it up. Go ahead. So we got a man known as Charles Bird and Marcie Bartolo. Do you know my Capitolio?  Oh, that's a free card. That's free not to give me some money. Nope. Give me some. No, no, that's free. Just to fund a second. Charging nobody for this. And this is finalized card, I guarantee you, is on the final card.  It's free to be 100 percent. I don't think they have the finalized card.  Three weeks. It's been three weeks.  Thanks for Wikipedia's Wikipedia. You'll see Dotcom's always so far, but they always have, like, you know, that Shadowfax like, really popular.  Listen, man, I'm just trying to get this thing going again. I'm happy that has got the kind of bond.  So there's not a whole lot of human beings that would make the choices. And thank God for Dana has a lot of a lot of Trump in him.  Doesn't he know? He does.  Oh, he has Dana White. Jesus Christ. He does everything. Doesn't have to be Trump. No, they're similar. They don't give a fuck. He's friends. They don't give a fuck. Yeah, it's Frank with Trump. I know, but it's good to go back to Penn. They're very similar. I know. We're going down this road back to politics.  Let's talk about 9/11. I don't care.  So let's talk about Sandy. Hurby, we can do anything about it.  I'm reading a great book called Ghost Wars about the secret wars of the CIA in Afghanistan. Oh, dude. In Afghanistan, Jesus Christ. Let him talk. And directed by the same author, Steven Cole, hell of a book about that Pakistani ISI, their CIA and the CIA and the war in Afghanistan that's been going on in Afghanistan and Afghanistan with the Uzbeks, that Tajik and the Pashtun. We you sound Brazilian's.  Sorry, did not know. You don't go because you'd love words.  And Director, that's outstanding. You'll be much smarter about the situation that we spent two trillion dollars on over 70 years. How much people talk about the efficiency of federal government? Two trillion dollars and we're giving the country of Afghanistan back to. I can't get into it. But the point is, bro.  Oh, I just trying to get a girl that are up. Lederach Let litter up. Get up.  Angela says get up. Oh, she let her go. Wow. That's big. Her dropping kludges.  That's a big is at the roughed up fucked up Democrats fight with a neck tattoo. It's not like alcohol. Cigarettes.  Yeah, I don't know Tom. And I just I agree with as you say and mean there. Yes.  I mean, not the actually smell like cigarettes and maybe it was alcohol swab. Oh. Maybe it was alcohol and rubbing off.  She's Dundar. She's done with that right hand. She she's in trouble. Hill's on the prowl. Oh.  Oh, my goodness. Oh, my goodness. See this I'm talking about with Hill. She's coming into her own man like she saw.  She's to Brian's point, she's so athletic. First of all, she's so athletic the way she enjoys it, man. She has fun in there. And the more she does it, the better she fights.  Nominal. She's a fighter.  Yeah, well, she's getting even more comfortable, too. Oh, she's got the combination and it slips away from the counters.  She's she's beautiful. Catch and her face. Our friend has also been in some fucking wars, man.  She knows how to like wars to win support, but she knows how to get through shit.  She's been through shit before.  I say hands down the you know, you keep saying that she looked a little tired so that when you get sun your hands go down.  You know, when you really when you just hit a heavy bag for three minutes, you realize how ridiculous it is. Tough to fight for five. Oh, my God.  What's so say, about twenty five minutes ago? That's the most ridiculous thing they ever ask any athlete to do. For twenty five minutes. Wrestling was three minutes, three minutes to twenty five minutes. Please try to wrestle for nine minutes to fight to the death. Dude, fifteen minutes is an eternity. I remember I was fighting Gonzaga in the third round like Trevor Whittman yells out three minutes.  I thought, you fucking asshole. Oh my God. Give me give me the minute mark. Three minutes. Hellish. This is the worst. People don't realize how long that is.  The thing is like that switch in your brain when you start thinking too much about the time. Yes. It's such a dangerous switch because it causes anxiety unless it's one minute left.  And do you remember when I did time for Hegan in Abu Dhabi in in Sao Paulo?  When you fart, you remember this dude that completely, like, just got deleted from my brain. When you when you don't remember the same time when you fought when you fought Mr. Graisse, he was fighting at the same time for time for him.  Yeah. He was years later when Eddie was having his match with oilor like that same event.  There was a moment where he was free.  So he goes, I want you to do the time for me.  You could quickly. But he, it was the total opposite with and it wasn't about like, like panicking about how much it was like let me know when I should move to this. Let me know where we're at. He wound up winning the match. It was like smooth. I go take a minute.  He's like, correct. Correct me about I'm the top five are going to be submission grapplers of all time to this.  A battle of Hoy's I mean, excuse me, of Hickson versus Hegan. Yeah. He gets a big fellow I know back in the day when he was young, I believe this is and he knows that videos like from eighty eight or some shit kind of gets the Boston crazy and wins the fight. But by 1770 he got swept up to try to score points on and he did on top, which is insane. At that point it was like oh my God, somebody scored points.  I think it was something like that. Well he had the combination and still does have the combination of being very big and also very technical know.  But he also trained he also was one of the first two guys who went to train with recognize some guys he can train. He can has a deep knowledge of Grecco Freestyle. His he's he's about wrestling.  Isn't it weird when Hixon enters the room, they're seen. It's like a sense of royalty, like everyone can know. But he entered the room.  I was like, oh, I thought everyone's like, did we all seen Cho? I haven't seen that in forever. We all saw you and I watched that together.  He's the real deal. What Hicks is such a legend is the guy that was on another level, such another level that all the athletes all go down.  They buy the book because they all rolled with them and they all got smashed.  That doesn't happen in any other sport. And when he came in, the room is a room full of killers and the room went silent, silent, like, who have you dealt with?  That was astonishing in their technique. John Jocke every time I roll with that. Yeah, John. John, I know the guy got much laughed about from John Jack Machado.  I have never, ever, ever. And some people think I'm just lying. I'm being nice. I've never, ever come close to submitting him. Never, not even close.  The most I've done with John Jack as I swept him twice within twenty years, twice when it was because his knee injury had some surgery.  And I put a little a little a little twist back on him. And he didn't want to he was hurt. But other than that, that got smashed to me. And then the next guy after that is when I went to New York City and rolled with Marcello Garcia.  Oh, like I put a fucking stop meeting on Yemen. There's levels to everything. Everything there is everything from fucking fencing to driving cars. There's. Levels, clutter, clutter is so durable. Oh, my God. That they show that right hand that Angela dropped on. So that's why this round's going to determine who wins.  It could be up early and high and drunk. No, but you look at the numbers. Look at the number one one.  It's one one imaginative, like it was like five companioned, scoring in like the corner. I feel like every UFC that we were in that we'd still do better than these judges. But you know how ridiculous that would be like if everybody said, listen, we need to have a fight. Score scoring. They're not paying attention half the time. They're also high in half the time they're high. They're drinking wine and whisky. They're talking shit about everything.  There's conspiracies happening.  We would still do better than the current judges. I believe they're talking bad about YouTube on YouTube. You're seeing the three of us want to be better than the judges.  They have you shitting me. No, we wouldn't.  We're not paying attention. Come on. I barely said we paid attention. And I love that dude.  I've no idea I to fight.  I mean, I'm happy for Iggy. I think he's a beast. Come on. I think it's interesting to see Barbosa at one forty five to the right.  I mean it's the quarantine. I mean it's a first time back for something like that. We got a lot of course back.  If one kills the coronavirus so does pure pure whisky.  Yeah, whisky. Usually Lysol does too apparently according to the back of a Lysol bottle.  Do but the you know what man. The experience of call fights live, especially a fight like Tony and Justin was so bonkers.  Did you have fun doing it. Fuck yeah. How about when people say is it better with fans or no fans like deafly fans. I don't give a fuck how much you guys like it. It's a different batard it all. But here's the thing. It's a different thing.  It's a different thing for me, you know, because like because I've called so many fights with fans. What was different about it is I had a real clear understanding of exactly what was going on with no no cheering about distracting what was part of the impact of fighting this fight. How about the Cochimi decide they would listen to you guys? Court is getting pissed up here, man, but it's a fight for this round. I know I'm drunk. And my point is that fight would have been fucking amazing with a crowd.  No, but it was also fucking amazing with no crowd. It was amazing do for me being there. It was the Twilight Zone.  I felt very, very fortunate. Oh, you guys feel to be there but to see it. How about Anthony Smith first global picture my was punch him. I'm sorry. It's part of the job. Anthony is what he does. I'm sorry. It's part of the job, Anthony. It is what it is, man. Yeah.  Huh. Yeah.  I love that you really never got that sound bite. You're right. We would have never heard it so clearly so bad.  Look at how bad ass is Anthony Smith. How bad ass is Clover. He's forty forty. Look better than ever.  Like physically when he got into the shit is Claudie he looks younger than me to the hilt Long Giannis losing this fight over Angela Hill.  Like we said she's is beautiful She's really coming into her own as a fighter she Oh she's doing it that long man. It's crazy how good she is and this is no szekely in the world. Claudia you think is a legit contender and she's so good coming into her own.  This is what's happened to answer Hill is all she needs to do is to head to off the line of defense for perfect timing is out of control distance like no one can hit her. Yeah. Yeah.  She was a go to something that she's famous for, like a big Rijad or something, maybe even growl or whatever. Her foot got a head kick. You keep doing good fundamentals.  Just keep fighting. Let her talk.  That's what she needs to do to get famous. Just let her talk. She's loose. Yeah, because she's funny, articulate. She's good at fucking Instagram and her Twitter. Her social media. Yeah, she's great. Where's she from.  She's in San Diego. She's down there with Alliance. Wow.  That's fucking team of Savages San Diego and stumbles to San Diego State. Phil Davis fucking great place. That's I'm they move there to throw down to the La Hoya Steuer, who's the San Diego mayor.  So, you know, the crazy thing about this thing is all of a sudden everybody knows who their mayors and the governors like all of a sudden now we know I know idealistic simulcasts. I didn't even know who the fuck our main idea. I never thought I had no I. Garcetti, he's my man. Yeah, he's my brother.  Brian, what's your slogan? Get involved in politics.  If you don't get involved, involved in politics, it'll get involved with you. It's not exactly. Exactly. We cannot afford that. A great line. I can't afford to not be that. I am philosophically committed. You make that up. No, it's a..  No, but also just take credit for it. So that's great people. They want people not in form. They would rather have you paying attention to football. It's because if you pay attention, it's really easy to see who the bad guys are. The good guys, really easy.  Do you need a. All you need is a third grade education and paying attention, and you're like, how long? What kind of education do you need to see to figure out that Pelosi's village hears about the way you have to be here?  You have to be like this shit, dude. There are a lot of obvious, so obvious. Pelosi's like are just democracy. The democracy should sound like that. I think he has a hidden talent. I think your ability to imitate people here in this room is basically her words, the way that was influenced by alcohol or weed. Prop. 12 did horrible impressions. I apologize, by the way, but you get the point what a bad motherfucking Mike Tyson is.  He was talking like someone was saying something about Connor fighting for it. He goes, you understand what he did?  He went ten rounds, one of the greatest person in the past hundred years. And they make fun of he goes, what a warrior he is. Never had a boxing fight. And he went ten rounds.  And that uppercut, he led people like, oh, it's because Floyd let that happen. You think Floyd won't eat that up again? Are you out of your fucking mind, chance? No chance to fight another day in his life because that fight he fought.  So there's no way Claudia won this. No way. Well, we'll find our chance. I mean, he fought the craziest proposition fight ever. Amazing. A guy with zero amazing fights, the guy who's arguably the greatest boxer ever.  There's a real argument for that was fighting one another because, well, it's also boxing is a sport of hitting and not getting hit.  I would argue that no one's ever done it better than.  Oh, sure. Why? I'm high and drunk. But I thought Enzo won that fucking fight. So she so did she was you guys weren't paying attention. She's paid. What are you talking about, guys? We're not paying attention, guys.  We're talking about just how Trump trump that she can just enjoy the fight. You're Pelosi to win that fight, fight and pussy at the same time you got here to win Trump. You're winning a fight at all. That's crazy.  Don't think she won it. That's crazy. I'm was this last round. She didn't win with this.  I am going to be 100 percent honest. I watched 40 percent of this fight. And I love Angela Hill and I love Kludges Good Dahlia.  But we're too drunk and high, so I would never see how this is and those highlights. I was an obvious first first round, but. Well, you know, Brian, listen, she not really, though. I would like to walk you down the slope in the third round. She knocks it down with a pun challenge. You weren't paying attention. You won the second round usually. Right. Though he does pay attention when we're talking a little bit.  A little bit. He's got a point. I'm sure this is obsessed with politics right now.  And it's frankly, I'm getting sick. Oh, she was. She's with me now. So that's Mark. Yeah.  Listen, I don't think you can you know, you have to watch that in silence. Decisional, who knows.  Well, what decision means it can win either way. Yeah, she should have won, first of all, mean I'm going to shut the fuck up and watch the fight. I didn't see this. No, I don't remember this. If I had to talk about this fight, I hate talking about fights that I barely watch, like when we do these fight campaigns because then people get mad at you.  Well, because I'm not really I'm not. So you need a disclaimer and that's what you're doing right now. I always do them. I always do.  Just make it really clear how the family paying someone to really do that.  Claudia, what do you think? I'm, like, crazy.  I have no idea. I will watch tomorrow. I'll definitely watch it again. I see that video.  I see that video. There's a black lady. She locked herself in her car and she's smoking a cigarette and she's making a video to Trump and she calls them squirm.  Just lets them out scrub. Oh, you went up them schools. You better school scrub because my kids are driving me insane. These motherfuckers won't shut the fuck up with their cartoons.  Oh, look at the numbers and the max. Why do you want every number? Look at the numbers, claudie one. Every number except for body. I didn't see that at all.  But those tones, you can't you can't go based off numbers. We're barely paying attention.  But you guys are also Democrats are also drunk. Democrats don't want to call, fight, scream.  Oh, here we go.  Drunk Democrats don't know we need another political designation. That's what we need. OK, let's talk about come up with this. You know what I mean? Like legitimately this idea of being only or left wing.  I agree. Not right wing. I agree. I grew. I know. But I'm the same way, Eddie.  I'm saying the problem is having wings. Have any wings.  No, no, no, no. This is not about left or right Democrat. This is about there's a lot of bad Republicans. It's not about that. It's not about that. It's about truth and real shit. That's why there's a lot of Republicans that are full of shit. But when that's what I'm saying is, yeah, man, it's not that Republicans.  Democrats because it's team. All right, listen, Joe and I were talking the other day about. Just as we've come up together, we're talking about what's important is like we want to solve a problem, right? We all want to solve a problem. And rather than being emotionally attached to your ideas, which is hard not to do, but as you get older, you have to say, here's let's let's try to beat a bad idea with a better idea.  Right. And let's try to see what's going on here and try to solve this problem. Let's put all the ideas on the table. Let's be honest about it. Let the ideas scrap it out. It's called ideas and then either come up with a new idea, a hybrid of all our ideas, or for some of these ideas wins the day.  You're talking logic and there's no ideas that are ridiculed. Right. So there's some stupid ideas out there.  Don't come back. So don't go back. Don't read the person evidence. Don't ridicule the person. They just have an idea. I'm smart. In fact, I have to get out.  Isn't it so weird that flu kills hundreds of kids, thousands of kids every year and we don't shut schools down and Crono doesn't kill shut schools down to biological? Brendan, they're not crazy about just.  Yeah, it's not about logic because the fear is that the kids are asymptomatic transmitters and they give to teachers and the teachers give it to their, you know, either them or their parents like this.  The worst teachers stay away from their countries. So we close the down because.  Eddie, Eddie, that's not what I'm saying. What I'm saying is the reason why they thought it was a good idea is because it's like a hub of transmission, because you have all these people get together, all these kids get together and they have it, but they don't experience the symptoms.  For the most part, the parents they give to the teachers, they give it to their moms. People die like crazy. Yeah, this is what the fear was, which is why, look, it doesn't come down initially. I don't think you and I are basically saying don't arbitrarily tack on another three months without any due process.  Also with you guys, you can also say this is the way you get back your freedom. Yes. You can't say things like that because that makes people real suspicious. Yes, he is.  It makes me angry. But now that what he is. But now that we know the worst case scenario, but now that we know, especially with schools like kids back in fucking school, man, but let the teachers take the precautions, not go see their grandparents, let the kids back in school is really scary since this is when Hitler took over German crest.  Right. I'm reading the fucking Germans were desperate and it was a bad time during the Depression. This guy came along with this pro Germany mentality and this really magnetic speaking and screaming, and he got people to do some horrific shit.  Both the she should have all been as know the fight against terrorism. Would you say shut down? There was a fire in the Reichstag and said these terrorists have to be controlled with one of and they suspended all the civil liberties just now, Nero did in Rome.  Right. It's just like this that those who made an enemy, it was like, this is why everyone's doing you, because the Jews. Do you know Prescott Bush's. Does that name ring a bell? OK, who is it?  I think it was George Senior's father. Yes. And he was saying this was grabbing, lying, cheating you.  You know that he will. Only an international banker probably.  Oh, did you know that he was he got indicted for funding the Nazis. Do you know any of this?  Brown And you fucking read. I did. Do you even read? You didn't know that. I didn't. I did grow to look into that. There's a there's there are some gang stories.  Oh, there's way more to the story than you fucking can ever imagine. You looking at it. I'd love to hear.  Get some rogue. You think it's some rogue evil motherfucker trying to take over the world. He was finance. There's a whole story behind him. But what we know. We already know. We already know. Rick and Morty. I wanted to make I wanted to just make one little point.  You son of a forget about forget about Hitler.  I'm just saying there is you've got to say I don't want to argue about this or have a debate, but you got to say there's so much deception going on that there's got to be at least 10 percent of you that when they believe that maybe 10 percent, maybe there is some deep political shit that I just haven't looked into, maybe there's got to be at least 10 percent of that. And Jimmy is so cool with all this deception, with all this deception, 10 percent going, damn, maybe there's a lot of maybe it's so deep and complex, maybe.  But maybe he's coming. OK, OK.  May twenty third Gilbert turns to May 30th with hopes of landing in Las Vegas. Oh my goodness. Please say yes. Vegas has started to open up some stuff. I know that.  I know they started all this talk about opening up casinos and giving people a bag that has like a mask and some hand sanitizer.  And what if what if it comes back with a party and comes back like a fucking tidal wave where they just burst through? The face masks and everyone just starts raging and no one can control it and everybody's raging and everyone's going, Thuc. We really appreciate that. Crazy, right? No one has to say it's going to come out. No way.  I think it's going to come back so big people can't wait to go to comedy. I think comedy is going to come back. It's going to be fucking dude, Brian and I showing that Jesus is going to come back bigger than Brian.  I put a show on Houston. We have I think it seemed to me to be. So it's a half capacity.  Yeah, 450, 450. But do you guys just sell out arenas? No.  For 50. But they only let you do two hundred and fifty an actual show.  So it actually goes to the regular amount. Is it two hundred and fifty two hundred. I'm thinking about doing it as well. We're doing it.  It's sold out in 40 minutes. Good bye. Spoke in show said take it. Listen man, you got to be bigger than was on sale.  Are sifting through the 18th and we're doing I think boy by club the day of what's up son.  It's like it's like being in prison for ten years and you get the pussy that first, that first down the teeth of comedy where you go out and it's packed and they're screaming, imagine how that dude, it's going to be insane that we're going to do it.  You can have your best performances ever.  The Corona jokes you guys got everybody going to have an out on karate karate material, have Caronna mature, everyone is going to be connected. Couple are sick of it.  I have a ton of material, but I've decided to buy Corona. Everything is Corona decided by the whole world to.  OK, I decided by the time we start doing standup again, it'll be happy people are so sick of it. Everyone's going to have to tell me something you can't even talk like a fucking talk about and everyone's going to have their own come on wearing gloves. Everyone's going to have do Joey theas in six months. Oh, yes. It's a packed arena. Joey Diaz going off on Korona. Dude, how about was your daughter right? Murdered where?  No. Man first fight back. Yeah.  This is Wal Harris's first pipe back. Fight back to horrible story, I thought.  But the worst story, especially if you're a father, which we all are. How?  Well, she was murdered, Brian. His daughter was murdered. She was shoot. This guy tried robbing her. She tried fighting for the gun. He shot her and then they tossed her body. They and they found his car.  And they they knew by the amount of blood in the car that it was a life threatening injury moves. The way it played out in the news was horrible.  And then they showed this horrible story. They showed him a picture of the girl. We found this body in the woods. It's hard to make out. And he was I bought her those boots two weeks ago.  Oh, no, that's our that's our all our nightmare as people.  As parents, it's that's the worst. The unbearable can stop. What's the unbearable I can ever go to see unbearable people that go through that I like I can't really not root for him. I start crying. I mean, any time I see anything on TV about shit like that, I won't watch it. I instantly just start pouring. I want why I'm a big fucking deal. Won't want it. I start crying.  If I watch anything with kids, I turn to my girl. Whatever she is, don't come on, let's go. Do. I cried.  I cried myself out of fuck fucking getting. I was seventeen year old seven year old kid driving a car getting pulled over and the cops pulled me over, had alcohol in my car.  I would just start crying and they would fucking let me go dude. I would just start. Yeah.  Croggon did you see that five year old you got pulled over driving his parents trying to buy a Lamborghini? What the fuck? Yeah, four dollars in his pocket.  He's going to California, get a Lamborghini gastrocnemius. Super gangster.  That was the. Yeah. If someone doesn't sign that card to a long term rap contract right now, just grab we go, bro, you got balls.  But here's the other thing. That's the fattest five year old I've ever seen. The Crown. It's that kid. That's how he reached the Pels.  He was only man. He was so big. I was so fast. He was five, was on the highway and then they showed his family. They all looked like big brother in the squad. Oh man. That was so big you had to fight. You can't say that I refuse to do it. You're going to get here. It's it's coming off the death of his daughter.  I refuse to bet against him. It's a very tough fight for him.  Listen, Al, this is first fight back after having his lip literally split in half by Rosen strike. I mean, that was one of the nastiest lip injuries I've ever seen in my life.  And then he healed like Wolverine. Did you see how quickly healed he's been fighting since nineteen ninety nine.  That is so crazy. Is that true this year. Nineteen ninety nine. First fundraising.  Imagine that's number one. He won years after you started fighting. You're in the UFC in the top ten.  The heavyweight has only been he's never fallen in the top ten his entire career.  He's always dangerous. Like when he knocked out Juju dos Santos nineteen. And I'm Paul G.  What is his what is ranking in the UFC right now? He's nine. This is kickboxing, Victor and Cody, these are kickboxing, which is like trying to train it at high altitude martial Tyronne Spong.  This is all this kickboxing record the AMA may record. The whole thing is crazy. How many do you know?  A few guys have ever been a K one Grand Prix champion and then also being a dream heavyweight champion and also been a strike force heavyweight champion. How about Grocott?  Beat them to nuts, dude. He's got some real badass fights.  He's such. So, you know, he moved to Colorado and he's with high altitude. So how to test Curtis Blades Monster Alster over him. Justin Gayety. Right. They got to.  Here's my words. For Sandmen, him do juice over him. Yes, let him do juice.  I mean, you're setting a bad example.  I miss what I saw when he fought Brock Lesnar. I miss it. Oh, did you see.  Do you see Vitor Belfort fighting that juicy dude? Well, first of all, juicy. Yes.  Oh, yes. Oh, we always see the guy is fighting. He's so juicy. He's so just let me see. You've got to see it.  But it's pretty much impossible that he's a super athlete, a natural super. No answers. No Brian. Brian, I must show you show you the picture. And I want Brian to decide.  You guys asked me after juicy or not. OK, I feel bad because I really like this guy.  Me to beat your belt for an open championship.  I don't know how to pronounce hlah and G a l a you got it.  He's he's you tell me if he's on that. He's an incredible athlete by the way. He can like standing up, he can go backwards. Brian put his hands on the mat and then flip his legs over the top and he's, you know, two hundred forty pounds, whatever he was, he's brow. He brings human beings look like that.  What's his name too? He's a freak. I don't I don't want to pronounce his name correctly.  Picture he's thinking, man, I don't know that they can say it. Nothing the lane the Ghailani in Ghailani anyway I said what's this. Got a ton of times on the Internet. And he's a CNN special. I will say this. Well, he's the boogeyman. I'll say this. Frank went to Senegal and watched those guys who did LAMDA. And Frank said, dude, I'm telling you, seeing somebody six to 70 who can move like a lightweight was not unusual because I've never seen athletes like that in my life.  He went to Brazil. He went to Mexico. He went to Taiwan. You know where that he went all over there and just like, look at this video that just came out of Syria.  You just see the video just playing basketball. I don't know, back there all they're all four guys. Watch this. Watch this. Watch how this guy can move. He's a fucking heavyweight. Watch this will kick ready was set up.  Heavyweight heavyweight. I'll do that. He's you the guy he's fighting for the Olympic trials. That's natural. I think he's not somebody. Right, Fabrizio Salvado. Oh, yes.  We're doing the seal with the Wilko. He's the Jew. He's stepping on Fabrice over trying to wield against Travis Brown. And he wobbled them in the face. Knew it.  I know. Don't care how he landed. We'll get tossed around in this one guy like Angela Hill who stuck with it.  And you saw developing. They're striking because in the early days, Fabrício had no striking.  He was one of those guys jump up and usually, you know, people, you know, get champions who come in and they'll dip their, you know, their toes in that.  And then they water and some just say, fuck it, I'll just make money with jujitsu and then some just keep at it and they're the best of all time. And then he just kept at it for those top three and then he became a legit strike for me. Find out. What did you see?  What did you see him in his last fight, though, Fabrício?  I need give him a bike because he's thick boy. Like, look so thin.  He was off for two years. You came back and I'm seeing this thick. Yeah, he was.  It was definitely said you you're offering a sponsorship. Sure. I'll give them bike. That's the craziest thing. Is that. OK, so he's got your work. Yeah. I can make that happen. Eileen, I hope I'm saying his name right. Allen is 240 pounds.  He's got like five eleven to two hundred and forty pounds. A dollar Galani Weight Division heavyweight. Eleven heavyweight. So veto's fight. Heavyweight fights on. Fights on.  Oh shit. Oh you're crazy. You don't think the joystick and all the Aussie Aussie. Sorry.  I'll say you can take whatever you want. Amazonian Amazonian nerves were really sharp.  That's one of the interesting things when you look at other organizations outside of the UFC that's tested by Sarda, as soon as you see someone who you know for sure used to do testosterone but then wasn't allowed to see a subsequent performance dip and then you see them re-engage after they leave the organization, it's fantastic.  It doesn't take Inspector Clouseau to figure out that. What you know, you don't have to call in Columbo, you know. You know, it's weird. You know what's weird about having no audience?  It reminds me of when I used to a deejay had strip clubs on Saturday afternoons and they'd be nobody.  That thing was the same. Did you hear what I did, what I did? I swear to God, I would take I would have like a sampler in the booth where I could I sampled kiselyov like this, the audience. So I got to.  Oh, man. Well, just cracked them over. Comes in big trouble slowing them again. The biggest trouble, it's over. Not yet over by this.  By that. Oh you still lock you up.  Oh, my chance. Oh, my goodness, this is crazy. We want wild hair, so you really like you really want to win. Oh my God, he's dropping bombs. He's got a daughter.  Oh, look at that. My favorite show, all the air still in the middle.  He's surviving, holding his liquor. Stop that. That's crazy. Could have slipped down all that.  Worked his head up again. I think it might be his nose, man. I think it might be his nose. Oh, my goodness.  You're talking about this massive power. He's going to get a refund.  Looking too big. Oh. Hey, remember the Uber? Yeah, we did. Were trying to choke them out. Look at this. Oh, no drinking gravel, not drinking grapple. Yes. Here's one of the best teams in the business. He won the European Abu Dhabi. So much time left.  Any chance he's going to mount? Let's remember, he retired. He submitted veto over the guillotine. I remember that shit.  Yeah. He's got to really remember he got this guy, Ballinakill. He's got like a high standing guillotine, like, oh, one of the best. Yeah. He'll finish you. Yeah, that's a shit, right?  This nasty and very top of walk. Right. It is no bueno at a time. Dude, that's a lot of time.  And Overeem has been in trouble so many times and come through. You know, he's a guy who's been through wars, he's been cayo, he's Cale's people.  I mean, you want to talk about a guy who's been through the fucking trade we talk about every time we get together.  When Overeem flop, Brock Lesnar might have been the scariest heavyweight all the time of all time.  That time of all time, that time peak.  Was he still eating meat at the time? Yes, all the horse meat was all the horse meat. Yeah, but my my belief is if you go deep into the history, you're going to go into horse meat. OK, but if you look at all the results of horse meat, that one guy who fought Lesnar was fantastic with some sort of blind deaf guy who was doing a drug test, somebody who couldn't read. Do you have to add in two thousand one in Amsterdam?  Like, what's your test based on? I assume three. Do you remember his brother Valentine submitted Renney? Yes. Yes. Yeah, he was trouble in the street. Hung out with them in Amsterdam. Oh, two thousand one. Oh yeah. Time. Do you want to fight everybody. It was the glory to his brother thousand times. Listen, you need to hear that story.  Please go read the story. Shed Golden Glory. That's right. What do they come to me?  Because they had a show that I show called Too Hot to Handle. Golden Glory posted this big man show.  I met them in Pride when I work for Pride. Ouch.  I'll tell you the story letter. No, no, no. Stop, please. I'm listening. But boy, we definitely want to hear that. I wants to find this young man. Go to the second round, keep this. Might not go to the second round it.  Well there's thirty seconds left. Plus it took big deep breaths, big deep breaths and Overeem is moving amount. He's just like the clown. It's fun dude. He could stop him right here.  This is possible. Overeem has been around forever son but it's twenty seconds.  It's nineteen ninety nine and Fox. You can still stop him here. It's right here.  I don't know what to actually do. It should happen in the room. Come on man. Dude, I'm telling you he's asked.  He's got some of the old doubts that some somebody's illegal.  Come on Walt. Those are big names man. His knees are the best in the heavyweight division. The best. The best. Dhume have Great-niece, Kayode, Mark, Hunt, Kayode, but basically Kayode Brock. Well, you know, Brock Lesnar combination kicks to the body.  The Canobolas, what did it do? He had a weak body also always. I don't want to make excuses for anybody, but you always have to take into consideration that was a guy who had just had diverticulitis surgery and had something like 12 to 14 inches of his colon removed. And Westons, right. Yeah. And overweight. Oh, your intestines removed.  Check this out. Yeah, that's right.  In the gut it was you see you see the Lesbia go like this. And that's when he finished them. Yeah.  He had I believe it was like somewhere around Google. Find out how much Brock Lesnar had removed from his intestine.  He had a really serious disease and they think he had it for a long time.  Brock was so good. Yeah. And people didn't realize how good he was, but he got catapulted into stardom and have much experience being knocked out.  Randy Couture beat Carwin knocked out Randy Kiltartan Sheika when he submitted them. Yes. After taking a beating. How about the Franconia rematch?  Oh, you see the power pop rock. I saw that transition.  But that transition that they just replayed, a Walt came at him with a front kick and Overeem just pushed him and just threw him like a hero to the side.  You can see that there's like some serious power going on here.  It's interesting because like, who would Walt Harris be if they let him juice? You know, this and I'm not saying these guys should juice. I'm just joking around when I say that. Let him juice, but also let them juice, but also let them juice. But but the thing is, when but I'm just as a curious person, I'm like, what would happen if you gave him all the chemicals that we know that make your body perform better?  Because remember what was going to want to go to the NBA, what was a serious basketball player? His footwork is ridiculous.  How well these guys, when when you take these guys that have experienced high level experience in major league sports where the competition is fierce from childhood. Don, you know, these guys, they develop a they have a different kind of work ethic, you know, that's why Herschel Walker was able to fight and made what is in his late 40s, not a different kind of work ethic, but it doesn't always work because Johnny Morton was like, oh, I want to try that Cartouche.  And he's knocked out forever. Know what happened with Johnny Moore? What happened with Johnny Morton was the worst case scenario. This man is getting knocked down, put on a stretcher and take care.  That's the right side of the. He's like Johnny more wide receiver Detroit Lions, because let's do it. Let's avoid worst case scenario. Case scenario, he got a coliseum in L.A. He could stick it out on a stretcher. Oh, my drama over on top of him.  No, he's not going to stop, though. Oh, my goodness. You see that? You got that. Oh, my goodness. That was crazy. So, guys, that the story is Brock Lesnar had a foot of his colon removed.  Incredibly lucky to be alive. Yeah, and then he fought over him after that when Overeem was on all of Mexico.  Oh, dude, it's been in Mexico. The entire Sinaloa cartel was in his veins. He had those. Jamie, can you please. I don't care. Can we see that? Johnny Morton. Hey. Hey. What do you do here when you're in this situation? What did Johnny. I thought someone, like, has problems. It was one night.  It was no, it was here. It was in Tijuana. Scott, I was there anyone with me. And night is Eddie.  Do you remember this? This was the day that Brock Lesnar made his debut. You and I were there and I sat next to Crazyhorse as Charles Blake got drunk.  And, wow, what a great night that was. What did you say Sakuraba too? Did you. No, no. That was on the car.  Forget about the sunshade. Stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.  It's over. There's no way he's going to survive that.  Yeah, he's just going to keep beating them unless he's just stop over this and if he, if he picks up there's more than just got knocked out. If he picks up the tempo he could, he could stop. It got knocked up. I stopped him right there. Stopped it.  Fuck man. You just make the educated decision that the guy's in a position that he's not going to be able to improve without Wallace.  It's a good decision. It's tough because you want to give him a chance.  But the reality is you can't defend you can't defend that spot. He's kind of checkmated there. You know what, that hold the whole debate about whether or not it's a good idea to stop a fight, it's real tricky, man. You know, Dominick Cruz said to the referee before the fight, he said, don't fucking stop it unless I'm dead to stop screaming, dude.  Well, come on. Watch this move.  But the guy is he doesn't know what's going to happen. Oh, my God. Amazing. It was a great combination. John Lovering over is still he's still one of the best men.  He's the greatest heavyweight striker of all time.  And the a man and watch his body shop. Watch his body shot.  Oh that's why it's so terrifying that Francis sent him to the dark lands would probably the best knockout of all time that uppercut who is howling in between the happened to John Jones. I was like, you know what happened? I don't know man. They're just talking right now, Goldfrapp. And we got to go for that. Was that was like when when Bilbo Baggins puts on the ring and he goes to the dimension in The Hobbit. Dude, you know, I'm talking about that's what it was like.  Tell was one of the worst knockouts I've ever seen.  And remember the swing inside Googoosh. I was I would.  What would you Eddie, would you think about a fight between John Jones and Francis and Ghana? What would you think about that fight? Would you think that's a good fight to make fun?  Of course. What do you think John Jones would fight at two to four.  How much time do you think you need to get? Like, what if I want to do it would make sure I would have John Jones. And you were tight like you the way you are with Tony. And he said, listen, we want to do our best to prepare for this. Do you think I should put some weight on? No.  You think I would have to know what? I don't know. I'm not because John Spar's an expert on what you should weigh this.  I would just say with all due respect, whereas heavy weights and then there's Francis and Garnett.  Agree. But he started Alster, Overeem, Traves Brown in his heyday. Oh, great. They're all great one.  After starting one off the other, everybody got dealt with. Andre Orlovsky.  They're all the one thing I would say that you saw Jones. The one thing I would say to John Jones, I would say, listen, Russell, whom I like to party to, OK, I get it.  I get you got a lot of power. I get it.  But for three months. Two months. Can you you know what?  He needs to come in for three months. Can we do that? He's just a little bit. Once we have one day you could go out. You have to don't get too crazy like Dennis Rodman. Let them let him get us not off and come back and go back to camp.  Hey, listen, I get it. Shit. He's the dude. He's a fucking savage cage fighter. Let him get crazy. He's the best basketball people. Like if he gets busted for party and he's got coke on him, whatever. I don't give a fuck about that, dude. It's like, Kelvin, just step off here. The guy is a fighter. Let him party. Let him do a shit. Of course it doesn't matter. He's entertaining us.  Don't fuck the world with you.  Oh yeah. You're not like you're so innocent.  You always got to recognize that a guy that's going to be the greatest cage fighter of all the time.  He's the greatest fighter of all time. He's going to be wild. This can't be why that's part of why he's so corrupt.  Exactly.  Oh, he's going to make you see his tweet after Anthony Smith lost his fight. Yes. He's cleaning out the Smith house. Got robbed. Yeah. He goes a bitcoin. ReTexture What? He got that TV. Oh, my God.  That's so brutal. So sad. I didn't know that one. You're talking about the other one here. That one top GOP erased it. Oh, my God.  He's such a savage. Jesus, you'd be the bad guy, but be the bad guy. Well, I love this.  He's only the bad guy to people he's competing against.  He's just a competitor. But then again, like, that's how all of them are, man.  And so is Michael Jordan was a suicide. So what did you do?  You see Tyson given given guys tips, what was Francis giving Francis tips on how to shit talk, how to sell your children like, whoa, whoa, whoa. Now's not the time. We don't need this.  You might say you live, Francis. Just let his fist talk for him. Let him be himself.  Can you imagine talking shit on Axl Rose because he parties too much. That's hilarious. You I don't want him in the bed no more fucking drinks too much and does too much coke. I want Nick Jonas to replace him. You can't dance like that guy does with all the streamers.  Let's your fucking mind. You have to be drunk. That's a big win for Overing like sweet child them. It's also just to make it do anything they can do anything rappers and rock stars can do anything like sexual harassment.  I wish I could be a rock star. Hold up. This unimaginable existed as this. No, what he said.  Imagine the guy trying to dress up like Steven Tyler. That wasn't a rock star.  God, there's people like that. Go to West Hollywood. They're everywhere. Steven Tyler in his prime with all the stars and shit and a fucking billboard. Weiner sure not let me put his lips out, like trying to accuse, like Tommy Lee of like sexual harassment. They would go nowhere. It would go fucking nowhere. The court would just throw it right into the dumpster. They would take all to walk it out to the dumpster and just light it on fire.  I want to hear what he's saying.  Well, we can't really play it, though. We can't know.  We can't really put the fire in Ramadi, dude. Yeah. Covered around them and died a while ago. He died a while. You know, Kevin Brown emissions. Forty four.  He had a really, really, really, really bad staff like this.  Mercy. Mercy. Right, bro. The worst staff I've ever seen. I never saw it live. But the photographs online, he's opening his arm. He's got a hole in his armpit where you could see his tendons.  You seen it right in this pic. It's like the Rod Stewart swallowing crazy tropical Halmagyi story that you hear terrible stories everybody knows about.  Tell me tell me your golden glory story, Bill. That's right. So this is a dangerous story.  That's please. It's a dangerous story.  It's a long story, but it's about time I everybody's a bandit. Yeah. This is a cage fight filled with bandits. Yeah, that's what the fight. OK, that's it.  Well, here's this podcast. Go on forever. Go. I don't want to go home.  What do you listen realistically, do you think that California is going to be able to bring back to the point where we could keep doing sets?  I think we can make a difference between us for I think we can because I'm like fucking nuts. Not to the point of my whole my whole association's frozen. So I'm I'm at the point where, like, damn, dude, I'm going to fucking get even louder, you know what I mean?  Like, here, have more about our. Did you tweet out. I only want real followers is some shit like I don't want I don't want anybody that thinks that's locked down should go longer. I don't want them following me. Yeah. Like I don't even want to hear you. I don't want to talk to you.  Well I don't think, I think like fuck about I think we want to change people's minds who are mistaken. You want to keep this locked and all this bullshit.  But here the attitude that you're expressing skepticism makes sense. I understand where you're coming from. I get it.  But when you talk like that, what happens is people just dig in their heels and then they know, you know, they dig in their heels.  My whole life, I don't care if you want to make the world better.  People you have to worry about are not the people that are in control. It's the people that succumb to the will of the people that are in control, the people that believe.  And the only way to not get them to be upset at you is to not insult their opinions and instead to present your own in a way that's.  So I'm done with them. I don't know. But it doesn't matter. I don't care.  You know, kissing Eddie, you're focusing on only the people that you're going to war with.  No, no, no, no, no. I'm focusing on is if you're focusing on the people that are just not interested. No, no.  I'm focused on I am focused on the people that are with me and the people that are on the fence, the people that are not on the fence. And the way over there, I can care less.  I don't. But it's what I'm saying. It's just like me when you like me. Freedom of conversation. Like when you're saying freedom, you're taking complex issues. Yes, I know a lot of nuance and you're breaking them down to these binary positions. It doesn't it doesn't work that way.  I'm not trying to convince my my whole point is I'm not trying to argue with people way on the other side.  You want to think that way? Go for it. I just don't want you part of my life. I don't want I don't want you in my life. That's his family. I'm only into the future if you're on the fence, if you're like, I don't know, man, but what about this? And I don't know, man, but what about those people? I'm cool with that most people talk to.  You have not thought about this stuff nearly as much as you write. If you would imagine.  Like most people, I just don't have the energy for them. I don't I would say they're not I don't want to talk to I only have so much energy. It doesn't want to talk to people.  This is a lot of those people are getting swayed one way or the other, swayed towards the target. This is where they get swayed towards propaganda. They tell you what, depending especially Eddie, you got to let people finish their thoughts.  Yeah, depending especially on whether or not there's a bunch of other people around them that also believe the same thing. When you're around a group of people, you work with them, you live with them, and everybody is like, we got to get Biden in there. You've got to get Biden in there. He's the only one that makes any sense. And people start saying, yeah, well, it's important that we win the house. It's important that we to the Supreme Court, it's you hear this mantra that gets chanted around and then a bunch of people that barely look into it will fight you to the death that Biden needs to win.  And they barely even understand the process. They barely even understand what what they're actually trying to accomplish by keeping or trying to turn from Republican to Democrat and what kind of control would actually take place. But they'll fight you for because it it comforts them, the comforts them to be a part of the team that was going to give them love. Like Mike, your dad. Right, this guy. A lunatic. I don't know what we're going to do, how we're going to do either.  George, I'll see you tomorrow. And they go to bed, know they pretend that they have some power over this thing.  I always think about that. My favorite quote I told you, Michaelangelo's, quote, criticize by creating create something, come up with a way to criticize rather than because we all want to do that. I do, too, all the time. I get so mad. I just want to fucking be like, fuck those.  But then I suppose you were going to do we are all responsible. We are responsible for the people that are learning right now. We're all a group. True. We're all a group, a true to learn together. And the people that have survived longer experience more are responsible for relaying that information down to the people.  So let's change minds and try to change their mind. One of the things that we're we're faced with is we get to things. We have teams. It's a natural inclination of four teams and tribes. That's a problem. That's an impediment to like real rational discourse and to get power. We're one chimp has power over the other chimp. They become a little fucking tyrant. And it happens even if you think you're doing it because you're a greenie or even if you think you're doing it because you want you don't want any hate speech or you want to make sure that people enforce certain standards that are inclusive and you develop these code words to let you control the narrative without some sort of like exchange of information back and forth with people where everybody kind of gets to decide universally.  But that takes a strong person, but also let the reins go to everyone. Yes. And most people don't have that kind of strength. And another really good way to look at things is come to every situation with some doubt about your own position. Sure. It's very important to realize that you may be mistaken and that maybe not entirely, but maybe 20 percent or 30 percent.  You talk about being open minded. Here's the thing. Definitely don't be married to your ideas. Your ideas are not you. They're just. Yeah. And just because you're wrong with that idea. Come on, man. I've been everyone's wrong.  I've been wrong. I'm right all the time. And they were wrong. All right. It's all right. I'm wrong all the time. Everyone anyo you wrong all the time. Yes. OK, we're wrong.  All wrong about Rod's. Remember that shit. Dude, I was wrong to this is wrong. Hoping and praying that you were both right. I got you. I got an alien tattoo tattooed on my arm because I knew so much you about possible. Maybe, maybe it's possible. The one they found was a drone.  But I hear you.  But the thing is, the people, the people that I talk to, the people that I enjoy talking to on a daily basis, they're not Republicans.  They're not Democrats. The people that I talked to our own and Republican, the guys I talk to on a daily basis, it's all right.  And people people that should be in Vegas, they're not Republicans. I'm not talking.  But what we're finding out is, damn, it's when it comes to corruption and Democrat and Republican, if you look at it objectively and you're like a detective, you're like there's a lot more going on on the left than the right, because the people I hang out with, we point out the right all the time, like, look at these motherfuckers. Look at we're not into George Bush. I love George W. or Senior. Those guys are fucking the godfathers of evil, you know what I mean?  Like, I'm not into that.  The people I talked to at George Bush, we break out just in decent. Do I want to know what people like? I don't you know, what they say is fool me once it's fucking fuck up Iraq. I want to watch an episode of After Afghanistan fucked me three times.  I want to get in there where we just blow every takes over for Terry fade or type quits. I love that.  And Eddie Bravo takes over with his impressions of people.  I have the worst and the only guy who could do the only impression I got down Democrat. No, the only thing I can do Trump I got I can't do nobody. I'm horrible with my vote.  My voice sucks, but I can't be Ronja. No, I could do a little Brazillian every now and then. But no, I'm horrible. But you're the only one Essene dog from Cypress Hill.  OK, I'm here.  I got that and bridge right. Boy like you do you have you in the hot box.  Have you done. Yeah. Tyson's dumb luck but I didn't do Cynda. But if there's there's a Cypress Hill tribute band out there dude I could hop on Cypress Hill, so I got that down.  Right.  Yeah.  I'm not sure that's good for of we really do know. Yeah. It's perfect.  Being the only guy is I wish I had smallpox. I know Bernie Sanders material, but it's not going to work because I can't do anything. I can't do it. I got to Bernie Sanders accent. I can't really do it. I had to and I'm not good if I listen to him.  Eddie Bravo. There he is. It's like a 10 pound jujitsu tank top. We never discussed and we never discussed how, Hala, we should go down. Dude, I got to high.  I got so high with him. Those guys keep going. Perfect. There's a special part, fitness professionals that just seems like he's going to block me.  They just keep smoking weed. You know, certain professionals. They can just you're already done and they just keep going. They take you to another place. Action. Bronson, right. Oh, my God. Didn't stop.  He smokes on his show. That's all he does smoke.  And he invited me. So they were going to watch the aliens and get high. Yeah. Did you do it? No. No, I haven't done it. Yeah. They watch, they get high and they watch ancient aliens.  Oh, my goodness. There's some good fights.  Really, really great.  So I want to see that on my brown lip on the right hand. Oh my goodness. My goodness. That Brown gave it to them.  Oh, well, you just watch you didn't watch any of them.  No background. Check it out. I you guys missed.  Yeah. We should probably do a plate opinion now where we actually watch the fights.  I know, I know it's true that I missed the chair. I find that it was like a like that didn't look legit. Looks like Claudia's feet tangled up dude. How about our defense man.  Her fucking. Oh yeah. I think I'd have to watch it.  I like Angela Hill won that fight. I don't know. I'm, I'm six whiskey doubles deep.  I know as much about whether or not she watched that fight as I understand how the Senate worked.  You know what's going on with KABB, Dad? No, I heard he was in a coma. Yeah, he was in a coma.  And they flew him to Russia, to Moscow, because they they didn't like the whatever the setup was, where he was and he come out of it.  Yeah. I isn't allowed to hug after goals. It's great.  But the one guy scored his huggin.  They wanted to expel him now they wanted to punish him, but he's fine. Look at this. Look at this weird shit. Look at that nasty shit. That's where you see that stupid shit. Diapers on their foreheads. Right. Right.  Diapers on my face and everyone's like cool people that were taken to Auschwitz would be very offended by that Nazi shit. Yeah.  It's just ignorance to those dance. Did he win the dancing.  Yeah, but they can't say you got to be six six feet. Oh that's so crazy. That's so crazy. They got to change the soccer. Listen, I'm happy they can play.  At least let the stupid shit let it subside after a while.  The baseball rules are interesting. They're talking about what are they talking about.  No high fives, no fist bump spitting.  Do the demolition. No that shit demolition man they couldn't touch. It was in the future.  I think they're doing Demolition Man, too. Did I think they just announced it the and Wesley Snipes, I've been saying for years they need to bring Wesley Snipes back for blade blades, fours with a Shaq with Ryan Reynolds.  Get all the juicy looking at that. Yeah. How the world used to be. How long ago was that? February 29th.  Oh, my God. Now, look, there's no one in fucked up retardation that's retarded for crazies that kills eight year olds with pre-existing conditions.  That's what we're doing.  Well, it doesn't it does kill some young people. Oh, my God. This kill some people. So does it make a big deal?  The flu does. No, but it does.  Look, it's something that we need to understand and we need to protect people against.  But really, this is how it is. We're fighting out now. Those people have fucking died. Maybe it's like the median age.  But wouldn't it be logical? Why wouldn't it be logical that we cared about that shit for the flu the past three years?  It was going to be way worse. See, what happened was. But we have the facts. Oh, yes.  Now that you don't think there's much chance, Joe, I'm giving them the chance that there's something nefarious going on. You don't think there's a serious shit is the chance power and they don't want to let it go.  And that's what. Is there a chance that the leaders might be out here? I mean, so to think that that's exactly what I think it is. OK, that's human.  Hey, listen, you guys are right there. Fuck, I should be happy about that shit because that's beautiful. You guys are at least you're not fucking like promoting wearing face.  Imagine the magic of Joes like you. We're going to do this easily. Be like if I thought I needed to.  First of all, if I thought I needed a mask would mean I thought I was going to give it to you if I ever thought I had it. There's not a fucking chance in hell I would come in and give it to anybody. I would let you guys know, hey, man, I need to get myself tested. Something might be up, but don't worry about it. I feel pretty.  If you said, Hey, dudes, I've been checked and I would like to pause for Corona even if I was show because I still doing what I still do. No, you need to tell us.  I wouldn't do. No, I'm saying that you called me and said, hey dude, do the comparison for sure. But I have Corona. I would still do the show. Oh yeah. Article I thought you guys did. Yeah. Yeah. So that's helped you at all. You have zero fear of let me stop you.  You see y'all a bunch of bug chasers. I have the zero fear I see y'all a bunch of bull chasers out in this bitch. You're asking me to come in here and cough in your mouth. How about you respect your viruses every dollar, every time you respect your virus at the airport?  Scary, scary. Face masks are not required.  That's where Elon Musk comes in the Hyperloop. This fucking yes. Requires not just at the airports. This is what I'm telling you. I was trying to make a point at the airports, at the airport, at the airport. Got it. Facemasks are not required yet.  80 percent of the people at airports awareness cause they're scared.  They're scared.  I had a couple next to me. Twenty three year old couple little don't come to my daughter. Son of a nice feeling. A little homesick. OK, ok.  OK, well, you got to wear a mask when you go out into the hallway I imagine. Imagine if you go you get a security one of those guys because imagine if they were like you need to put a mask on. So this is gross.  Those guys seriously we told you I thought like maybe if I swear to God I thought about this, it was a very highly likely that I was going to show up and you were going to ask me to get tested.  And I did. I'm like I got tested last week at the UFC. That's the last fucking time. I know. I know.  You were tested. I got tested there. And how did they test you there? They tested me with up the nose.  I had to get the same bullshit.  It's interesting because the first time it was rough and then the second time I did it at home, I had them come in. They did the same thing. So I think my left nostril is more fucked up to my right nostril.  It's like sensitive in there for some reason, but my right one is numb where it was.  I'm telling you, if it was just my right now frustrating. I don't know, dude. I broke my nose when I was five, found on a flight, flight of stairs. I broke my nose, a gang at times I was a dumb kid.  I ran into fucking trees and shit and goes, no more.  Playing basketball in your kid is like your eyes. Just watch and you roll with it.  I got a broke a bunch of times from sparring too, but it's just for whatever reason.  The second one that I got on Sunday was was nothing but one of the things that I found, man, if you don't feel good, if you're kind of dragging an I.V. vitamin drip, nothing better fucking I get them all the time.  All inspective. Fantastic. Not Rondo Rondo Patrick. She told me try ten thousand milligrams of vitamin C. She was like, that's like the therapeutic dose.  You do that once we get that video banned. If you know you feel great.  I'm not a doctor. Sure. And anything but in vitamin B you me it that I can motherfucker.  Eddie please bounce back so well from hangover's everything jet lag if you're tired pal was the first one to turn me on to that Chapell would have everybody get together in one of the rooms and they would, he would set up IV drip bags and everybody was like, oh I'll take glutathione.  Yeah, I want I want a full vitamin C bag and some D just one of the fluid. Some I used to when I was on tour.  Like every weekend I fly back. As soon as I land Sunday, I'd have someone give me IV drip. Some days I feel great.  So much better off on your body. My God, it's flying. Oh my God.  I forgot how bad it was until this last weekend when I went to Jacksonville, I was like, wow, you guys interested in the stem cells?  What stem cells fix my shoulder did your better. Why did you go fuck works?  I told you. Fuck. Were you talking to a stem cell evangelist? Mr. insists on stem cells with who is Dr. Neil Reardon.  The guy who fixed my shoulder feels great. It's great. No problem. It's been like five months, dude. It fucking works.  What kind of stem cell did Clay just go? Mexico, that stuff. Yeah, chips. A hotel in Mexico. And right now they're like on hold right now. You got to go.  I was dude, I'm the guy. I wouldn't be saying that shit if it didn't work. I wouldn't be saying that. No. Why would you.  Before I woke up this it felt I just got out of shoulder surgery, major shoulder surgery. And I think maybe I came back to jujitsu a little too soon. And then, dude, after a while and I just kept rolling. I'm like, I thought maybe I reinjured it because every morning I'd wake up and it would feel like my arm was literally falling off. And then I finally decided, fuck, man, you know what, let me do that crazy Panama stem cell therapy.  I knew Ed Clay. He had a he has a hospital in Mexico and they do the same thing that they do in Panama right now. I went down there, T.J. did to see easy.  It was easy. I went down there. I stayed there for a week.  They gave me, like, the work. They I did a lot more than stem cells, but they injected I had stem cells in an I.V. and directly into the drug. And you know what?  Fuck expenses. Great expensive down there. It works. It fucking pricey, though.  They did my knee, too, but my knee was different because they had cut my knee was fucked up because I had knee surgery and they cut out like half my meniscus.  So it was just it's just going to be tender no matter what. It's not going to be healed 100 percent with all that meniscus cut out at a bucket handle terror. And I fucking just shredded it.  And Eddie, remember when I had a buckhalter, you had to drive me to the fucking doctor and an MRI drove my NSX. Yeah. What do you do when you don't know how to do that? Man, he was he was trying to get this out. Check this out. Where did you go out and did his knee jerk it was. How did you get to it gets fucked up so he could drive. He drove his NSX a little sports car.  I could drive a stick shift, bro.  This was nineteen ninety eight tons. But I drove stick shift in a while, you know what I mean? Because when you're poor, stick shift means you're poor. And like in the Mexican hood, once you get your automatic you're like fuck an automatic.  Yeah.  I told him to get a release from the bounds of those ideas. Yeah. Yeah. So now it turns out rich white people like Stich and then my dad had this son of a bitch was rich white.  So I, you got to get race. So once they got into automatic I'm like, fuck, you know, I got beyond the stick shift. Now he's got like a high performance stick shift and I say fucked up.  I got to drive to the doctor.  I've never seen the smoke so bad. He was so mad at me. He was so his knees fucked up. He said, shotgun. I'm like grinding the clutch, like going to the club. I don't like to use me to drive a stick shift. Do you know people tell you they know how to play pool, do not know how to play pool. Do they go to your standard. Oh my car's restriction. That was, that was in nineteen ninety eight.  This is the easiest car to shift ever. Understand as far as shifting cars go now you have to understand, like I have to speak out as a car business is in his in ninety eight loaded. I mean I think this was to date I think was ninety eight somewhere around there. Maybe two thousand at the ladies. Two thousand those years.  NSX were a marvel, one of the best cars available.  And you were so connected when you put it, when you put that motherfucker in reverse or any gear. I wish you still had the feeling I should probably get another one.  The feel of the clutch was magical.  This motherfucker just came. And I know that the only reason for it wasn't the grinding, it was the anger to me. He was so pissed off because he was already in so much pain, like, fuck me and I'm fucking his car. We're going to do what the fuck are you doing? I was having a hard time and it was pissing him off, I think.  And you don't want another great story about that sex. It was when I finally, after six months of getting in his ear about smoking weed, I was like trying to convince him to smoke weed.  I'm like, that's so funny. He's so funny without weed. I go, if I could get him to smoke weed because everything everybody thought I was crazy for smoking weed. So back in back in the day.  And then I finally convinced them we were in his NSX.  He pulls over and he goes, OK, fucking pull it out. I'm like, not right now.  I had a man back and a man I had a man bag with. We was pulled. I got dude no no to gay things. I finally convinced them, I finally convinced them to smoke weed. But it was while we were driving, it took six months. He pulls over, he goes, pull it out.  That's right out. He pulled it out. And this is going to be a car for sure. Let's do this.  The crazy thing is, oh, I'm like I told him I like I didn't drive for six months when I started smoking weed.  I wouldn't drive. I was too scared because, dude, just do it.  I'm like, yeah, I'm like, I'm driving down and I go, oh shit. We got to go to fucking Baskin Robbins. He's got to feel that shit because this is it. I finally convinced them to do it. So let's go. Is there an ice cream place? There's a Baskin Robbins down on Topanga. I go Litefoot we made up not as hot as you can. You know that first time. And, you know, I knew there was not much that that was.  That was it. That was it. And then check this out every day. Well, I take your coat. There was no, no, no, he doesn't remember, but that was my up and ups and downs. But I remember that night that night we went to Baskin Robbins.  He had a fucking hot fudge sundae and we went to the Comedy Store and he got on stage the first night he smoked weed. And the joke I'll never forget. He goes, Dude, I got high for the first time today, and, damn, I didn't realize that hot fudge sundaes were so fucking good. The crowd go nuts.  Yeah, he did.  We were like, I mean, not how I said it was the first time I did the first time in like at least seven or eight years, though, because when I met I met you, I was like, what, 29 or 30 or some shit about some of your, like, young?  I was like, oh, yeah, maybe they want to tell you I was 20. So do you.  Right now I'm fifty two. So you're two years older than me and knew we met in ninety seven. Yeah. You were twenty nine. Right. OK, but we didn't really hang till two.  Yeah well my little like ninety eight ish you were I think it was ninety eight was after that train that John jox like we knew. Oh there's an actress on Newsradio, he's on the Channel four show like oh shit really. But he only did privates. He never did the regular class because he's an actor on NBC. He was really bright. I remember him working. We read about I know when you were a down ballot, he used to work with you.  He started this up with a store. First time we met was at the store was I used to go to the store all the time.  I was working as a strip club deejay and I like taking strippers to the store.  My Sunday night on Sunday night, I was on stage and like, oh, shit. And I'm with the second. I'm like, I know that guy. That guy transversely. So you did a fucking set and you crushed.  It was all about pussy and you did crack in the day. I said, you know, well, how bad did I say the biggest crush I ever saw.  Yeah, well, when you do those when you do those like lines fucking that. No, I fucking I never beat that.  No, not only not only you know, they air those on Sirius, you're a little bit better. But those who don't get paid for them though, huh. I don't know. Probably do.  He used to crush. I would watch him fucking do the Comedy Store when I wasn't even doing it.  How many times have I yelled Tiger's fucking how many times have I yelled, no, I don't even know how to do my own act that I need right now. And I haven't thought about it.  I've been so stressed out. I'm stressed about I never get tired about the time I haven't been stressed out at all. Can you do before I'm stressed. Tiger's fucking out.  Yeah, because there's two different conversations going on now with you. I've never been the stress that I got was in the beginning when I was worried that we might not survive and we catch this. It would be deadly. And I would see my family members die from a disease when that didn't seem to be happening. And then this social isolation thing started working, social distancing thing. And, you know, and then we realized that it wasn't as big a deal as we thought it was.  I relaxed. But as far as, like, the not being able to do stand up, I just have accepted it. I just took it in. I think I think for vets like you and Brian, sometimes I think it's good for you guys.  Yeah, I think so, too. I guess I want to have a legitimate perspective on this. I don't want to have a contrived perspective that I think is going to be funny. Eventually, I'll say some ridiculous shit about it, I'm sure. But there's a certain responsibility that you have when you emerge from something that's as preposterously weird as what we've gone through over the last two months.  You have to think about what what you take in from this and what comfort you can give to other people who don't have a voice. You have a responsibility as a human being to not just be funny, but also to have like a perspective context. Well, as a person we talked about before, you are responsible for educating the people that are coming before you, because wouldn't it be nice if you had better information when you were going through your 20s and 30s?  Well, you have everyone has better access to information and how to deal with and how to deal with crisis. And what's with this, what his character is by being honest about your faults, your pros and cons.  Oh, that and to tell the truth and to realize, like, hey, man, we're all trying to figure this out. But now we're in this weird situation where we're trying to figure this out while we're trying to not die. And how much do we need to worry about dying? OK, are we sure? Do we have this figured out? I mean, and it's a lot of debate about that. It's a lot of debate. And that debate has to be rigorous and it has to be open.  Oh, got to let people talk. And as soon as you start banning videos, unless I like that picture, unless you're some sort of a doctor.  That specializes in some shit, you know, people are lying unless that's happened, we had real doctors on the front lines that I talked to Dr. Mark Gordon. Yes. About this for a couple hours. There's a lot of disparaging opinions, a lot of different from experts to the expertise.  But we also can also see the numbers. Well, there's coming and they're coming in.  Also, you have to take into consideration other sciences. Yeah. And you've got to take into consideration economics because they're saying, look, you people don't understand this thing that you just hit the brakes on. Like, you don't understand. This is something that operates on momentum and confidence and it literally might not have the momentum to restart itself. That's the it needs to be to get anywhere close to back to where we were just four months ago.  All right. We got to be careful.  Remember when we were talking about how crazy it would be if they shut the country down for two weeks, how nuts that would be and that funny. And we were like, can you imagine?  It's up, you know, ideas that weight gain weight in Frankfurt, Titos, Frankfurt, to talk to Dana White about it. Dana White related to me.  And they both we talked about it, but Frank Fertitta said, let's just rip the Band-Aid off. Let's just fucking shut the country down for two weeks. No one goes anywhere. No businesses work. No one was enticing. And no one no one finds out. No one can get it. He was right. But that harsh thinking, that sort of what we think of as like callous Republican thinking, that's effective. You've got to solve problems sometimes.  Not always, but that's where the bounce comes in. That's where I feel imprisoned by this idea of being either on the left or the right.  I feel imprisoned. Me, too, because that's you know, it's on this question that I agree with about a lot of shit. I mean, to write about hard work, the right about the importance of farmers, self-reliance, individual responsibility and my family.  Come on, man, I'll Second Amendment and fuck economics is not a small consideration in the House.  The health and the happiness of the individuals that are enjoying that prosperity inside the country, rewarding individual initiative. I mean, you know, let's allow let's go for creative destruction. That's a really important thing to keep in mind. Do you want to protect jobs? But you have to allow that people will come up with ideas that destroy jobs. I mean, talk to Tower Records or Blockbuster Video about that. Talk to flip cameras. You know, there was a lot of creative destruction that went into making your iPhone, the GPS companies about.  And and Kodak is not happy about this, but this is where we're at, you know, so the survival of the fittest.  But it's also the best idea. Yes. Yes. We have to take into consideration the people trying to figure that out. They're trying to figure this out in real time.  Right. And then what we have is the luxury of looking back at their mistakes.  Yes. And go and look at these fucking idiots. But they were acting on limited information. Everybody was scrambling. Nobody has seen it before. The problem is, now that we've hit this spot, we got to figure out a way to make everybody feel good about this.  The decisions that are being made, we got to agree on and to realize that there are people that fall through the cracks and we have to take care of them, too.  And we need a fundamental economist. Look at it. Well, we have a lot of them, but it's not about it's not I mean, someone who like aggressively. I need to get Peter I'll get Peter Schiff back on to have him explain his perspective. Schiff is pretty libertarian. That tends to be very on one side.  And I think it's also brilliant enough that his views need consideration. Yeah, it's like he knows a lot about the business. Do you ever see that video of him where the member of Occupy Wall Street is doing the part percenter?  Yeah, he was great. He's like, ask me questions, of course. But dude, it was great. It was like Mike Tyson sparring with babies. Yeah, it was.  Yeah. Because they didn't really they didn't know what there is. You know why it's hard. It's hard to earn an opinion. Yes. Yeah. Because it takes thought and it takes consideration of all different sides and it takes time and you have to read and you have to. It's exhausting fucking it's hard. That's why I'm not interested in it. Yes. My dad used to always say most people have attitudes.  They don't have thoughts. And that's that's what we want. A good that's a good expression. That's pretty accurate. That's exactly what we were talking about before. People they find out what the ideology is of their community, whether they're, you know, hardcore right wing Christian or whether they're Democrat, like Hollywood, working, working in film and television.  They're cultists and a lot of ways. And they're cult is the ideology of the left, no matter what. There's no consideration whatsoever to any other possible answer other than what the Democratic Party proposes.  And they ignore all the problems the Democrats have done and highlight all the problems the Republicans have done. Like it's not fair. And when you act in a not fair way, it makes all of us suspicious of your intentions, because I can see when you're full of shit and everybody else can see what. You're full of shit and I know what you're trying to do. We're trying to do is control a narrative with bullshit and it just doesn't work anymore.  It used to be able to work because you could say the same kind of things, but there was no one to respond. There was no comment section of the YouTube video. It didn't exist. There was no YouTube videos. Right. There was no Twitter. You couldn't you couldn't respond to someone's horseshit. So they got accustom to being able to get away with a real low level game, like some real UFC to type bullshit. But here they are, you know, were you talking about twenty?  And I said yes, OK, yeah.  Well, I'm talking about politicians as well. I'm talking about all these people. They're following a pattern that existed before then and then all of a sudden, like they get to the end of the cliff and they're like, oh my God. Like, hey, hey, hey, hey, slow down. There's no to go. And I'm amazed that is it that you you have news sources that are so openly biased.  I mean, openly. Well, Fox News is on one side. Yeah. CNN's on the other side. And you just know where they're going. It's just opinion after opinion has. But where is the objective news? Can I get some objective news?  Where where would you go to go independent?  I knew I was to be Dan Bongino.  Listen to Dan Bongino. Do you want politics? You know this right here.  Real quick, I thought Cowboy won against Pettis Meat.  You guys think he won against that cowboy pull that I want someone. I thought you one hundred percent won. That was a bigger robbery. Which one? I saw Michelle was someone that fight. And I said it to her as I was coming out of the Senate. I told her I thought I thought you wanted, but she couldn't get it. I didn't understand.  But, man, you know, she fired a gun.  So Otterson, she was a former world champion. One tough forgot her name, the wrestler. That's how drunk and high. Come on, all three of you don't drown. I don't get it. It occurred to me that's hilarious.  But that's exactly how any time soon I'm taking a goober.  I'm fine. I live a block away.  That's why I didn't smoke too much because I can't get into a car.  I drive Tesla less. Carlos Spa's Carlos. She she's going to sell a motorcycle. She didn't make enough money. Carlos Bars has been on the wrong end of some decisions to what Carlos Esparza's recognizes.  There was not one of her more recent fights that I thought she got fucked over, too. But the judging is not.  It's just Tatiana beat her ass, I think is the classic Adelia fight. Yes. That was a split. No, I thought she won that fight and I was really impressed. Claudia, good day.  Just split Ronda Marcos, bro. She beat Cynthia Coviello. She was a beast. Beast. Damn. She's on the three game win streak. Yeah, dude, it's a hard road for any human being.  They need more devotion, especially a hard road for female fighters and especially a hard road for like female fighters.  They really need like a five pound weight division difference between men to ten pounds, ten pounds short for men. This is what the Jon Jones thing is like. Jon Jones at two or five wanting to fight Francis like two sixty.  That makes more sense, though. It does, I guess.  But because John walk around in like two thirty to forty, if he gets Johnnetta, there's a 225 division and you have like John JDA, Stephen King.  John has that much of a hard time. Make it two of five right now. It's all right. He's never missed it. But doesn't he walk right up to thirty? He's a big fella. Do you remember when he got into heavy, heavy lifting? Remember, that was great he to get the other day.  It was really the other day him that deadlifting skinny legs, he's always and skinny.  So that's why he can keep his weight is probably why. Well his calves fight two of us calfskin. His calves are like some sort of a cartoon about another dimension. Upper legs aren't that they're pretty big.  Whatever's on his legs, his legs, he's the goat. Oh, he's when he does kick the fuck out of you with the chicken.  How about that do I video. And he's wearing the skinny sweats. They're black. Like what is happening looks like to blacks. I see that you haven't seen that it'll break your heart. As I said, it's another to you because he has to remember things and he, he was I get punched in the face man. My short term memory is fucked. Just won't to let you know before we start this.  I'm be fucked. That's a good answer. Good answer. Is that soy or is it honest. It's a very smart guy. Is pretty smart. So my guess is that good is smart I guess is he's prepared. You can't be that good if you're not smart.  Fossilise first time at the law. So I'm sure you both you know, Joe Johns is a smart dude.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. You can't just be physically talented and be able to overcome the stress and the pressures of championship fight. Not the last that wrong. There's a psychological element to it.  You've got to stop being right and smart. Fucking do it really tough.  Do you know Matt Hughes deserves a shitload of credit for this too? Because when Matt Hughes got choked out by. By B.J. I was interviewing him in the octagon and he said something I'll never forget. He said it was a relief, said it was a relief. It's like there's so much pressure and everyone coming after me. But he was just so honest about it, about being champion and then about just the relief of B.J. tapping him and worrying about he didn't gasp say that.  Yes. He said it was a relief after the Hendrix fight. He just I don't want to do it. I take the tumor.  It's literally like there's a certain amount of stresser your body can take, whether it's if you do three fights a year, it's this amount.  If you do two fights a year, it's this amount. But there's a certain amount you can take. Yeah, that's why we saw a gasp.  It was so interesting about him is that he just settled down. Let everything sort of. He took time off training, he got a trainer like we didn't know that when he came back against Bisping, we thought like, wow, he's been out for four years.  What could it be like to KGPE back in the act? He was way better. He knew he was way better because he never stopped training. He trained like a martial artist. Yes. So that apparently he got real sick, though. Yeah.  Because he was eating so much. I try to keep keep keep his weight. Really. I was just testing the shit out of you so you can't do anything in terms of supplements.  You middleweight champion of the world, how much creatine can you take.  As much as you want. You get if you take a crap up. I mean if you take cramp up, you will shit your shit. You take enough creatine of, you know, shit all the time.  He took that much salt, he time to take some that much granular stuff. Your body's like, hey, hey, hey.  It's clear the whole time I enjoy it, bro.  Have you ever done one of those salt enemas? No. Eddie, you ever do salt into my drink about a bunch of warm water down a coffee and that back when I when I got stemcells, but I don't mean up the ass anymore.  I mean, yes, there's a better of salt water.  No, I if you drink saltwater I found this out when I did this sober October challenge. I was sweating so much I kept pouring Himalayan salt in the water and shaking it up. And that's what I was like. I'm losing so much weight.  You need electrolytes. I'll tell you, when you have that much salt in water, you just fuck. It's like it's like if the Hoover Dam was, you know, one of the things that just like, jumps up when the tea's ready to take. Yes, that's crazy. So it just goes well. It's that way.  Vibrancy to food. It doesn't usually do in the carnivore that no guys ever do coffee enemas.  No, I've never done anything up my. But other than one doctor, apparently no doctor go in three three three fingers knuckle day.  I had one doctor. Does the bank ask me questions why I finger in my butt. Oh me too. Hey can we do this one at a time. We pressed for time here son.  My doctor had some fucking bratwurst for your and three days. That's right. Did you make sense at my age to to get I to want to get a one hundred pound man from the old lady. I got Melisse.  What did he say to you afterwards? You're good. You're young at your age.  I'm telling you, you're super. I'm talking to you because you have a little twinkle in his eye when you're fifteen. Your prostate checked out. This is four years ago.  Yeah, that's good. I'm going to test your balls if they're assaulting me right to the emergency room. Those gloves winning clean came out. Chocolate covered, chocolate covered.  It might have been his day planner.  Now, when some new show looks good, looks like I need a new show.  Man Do you finish? Ozark come on, dude. I'm in the court. How do you not finish up? I don't know, dude. I'm good. I'm a fan. I'm going to go out on a link. I'm a top five.  Top five shows the top three of all time that don't include monsters or dragons or Superman.  Yeah, because in my bold statement, probably not, though it's my opinion the greatest of all time is game three.  Best. Greatest of all time. Yes. Shots season the greatest of all time.  It's the ultimate it's so outlandish the things that happen. People are fucking their brothers and sisters. But forget about the nicest people. I'm actually in the dragon skins, bro. Bro, white walkers come the fuck on and you are there every step of the way. There was no one season where really fellow dude, how about the day when the dragon turns? In a way what happens when I opens up in the bottom of that.  Like I was like no way. How about when she wants it then it's over.  She wanted to kill that one person. I forget it was a guy or a girl, but I remember she was standing there and then the dragon came up behind her from the darkness. You remember that that scene?  Yeah.  That might be one of the greatest scenes in all of film when Khaleesi is standing there and then out of the dark face just emerges and that person knows they come up.  That ball that you remember was a baby dragon and the guy's trying to hold it.  And she goes, no, he's not wanting to the baby dragon. He's crying like, no, that's not this movie. No, the guys from the guys. Oh, yeah. Yeah. And it's like season two. It's not used to it's not used to taking orders, bro, just because it was a stupid Parker Brothers kills a stupid park.  You really fucking stupid.  They should have never killed off Jason Momoa. Hey rewrite this shit with Jason. It's good. He's a badass on that right now. He's just. Fucking Calice Doggystyle. He got fake tits for that. Yeah.  How about what, John Sulkily Khaleesi remember when John John Snow does a crazy way to hate my dad?  That's how I lay down the dragon I love. I know. Didn't say shit. You know, I love you like going spoiler alert man.  What the fuck do that came out years ago years.  I want to watch your sex talk show that comments section. I think Ozark gets no to more than Breaking Bad. You know, one of the things I like about Ozark is how goddamn original it is sticking inside the United States of America. It's still so many different elements in Missouri. Here's here's how well written and well acted as the scariest people on that show. Or two women.  Yeah, the scariest the lawyer and all the crazy kids. Don't tell me number three is Ruth. Don't tell me this, gangsters.  How good of an actor is saying the young kid that I hear about this guy and I'm only in second season do.  Yeah, you're talking about a sports. You want to close your ears up. Sports are off right away. She blows up, dudes.  Spoiler alert. She killed her own husband. Spoiler alert she was going to kill her.  I'm not messing with this frozen gangster. The scariest people are them and the Mexican guy. He's the scariest guy.  Navarro guy. Scariest guy, scariest guy. Scariest guy. He.  How about once the law goes, though? My clients all the season ending the last scene.  Don't say a word. I'm going to say, oh, it's too much fear of the Xynthia narco season. One was bad and dark goes to shit but narco season one was right there with it. It's right there. Narco season one was so good that due to played, Escobar was so good because he was his Brazilian.  You know that. Yeah, dude, he was believable.  If I was the CIA, I'd follow him every day. That guy's killing cat somewhere. He's great. He's too good. He was good. He's tall. He's got to have a darkness narco season one season too sucked.  Yeah, you're right. Know. Did you much better get the strangest thing. Love it. No, I didn't like that show love. Did you fuck episode one episode. Well you're a weird Nazi. Why I not. I like some of it with an eleven. You didn't finish it. You have no idea. Son of a bitch didn't finish it with aliens. Real question is sick.  How how hard was Joe Namath slinging Dick in the 70s.  Oh was cold before the night before the Super Bowl. He's drunk.  We're watching Joe Namath right there the night before the Super Bowl. He was drunk.  I believe it. But there was a different world of human being born with a metoo movement right there. Oh, my man. That's all they did.  You mean you think women got me to by Clint Eastwood. Come on now, please. It's given for me. I don't think Clint Eastwood actually had that reputation.  Did The Unforgiven Baby Mamas? Yes. Oh, yeah. Shut your mouth. He likes to fuck. Do you know how many like The Unforgiven is probably one of the most underrated movies.  Great. One of the greatest movies of all time is. It's phenomenal. It's a basically fucking great movie. He basically did these Westerns, these like sort of like very simplistic, rudimentary plotlines of these Westerns. They were good movies, but they weren't. They weren't. They weren't. If it's like he stepped away from the genre and reimagined it and then came back with it was like, wait a minute, let me hit you with some real shit.  You know, you some you know, he did the musical portions, you know, music. He played a genius and directed and wrote a lot.  I mean, he was William Money. William Money, the character that he played for. Yes. That's one of the scariest USAC. You don't tweet if you go back and look at, like, shredded, they showed it didn't matter. I know he's just that. But he was like his normal body for a fucking gay porno magazine. But now you've got to be Sragow. You're right. I know. I know what you mean. He was like a real man.  He was like Steve McQueen or fucking Carl Newman or Brian Cowen or whoever he was.  First of all, he was supposed to play an old guy. Really? Well, your money was old. He retired. He was in a freeman. There was trying to be Morgan Freeman. Yes.  Morgan Freeman, the black guy was OK when he saw Morgan Freeman. You haven't seen anything. You got to watch it. Also, remember, I'm younger. It's also historically accurate. Jamie, have you seen it? Is that true?  There was a real money. There was no historically accurate in the fact that there was a lot of freed slaves that became either soldiers or bounty hunters and a bunch of a far more against Native Americans.  Yeah. Yeah, no doubt. Yeah. I've seen Clint Eastwood in the Mule.  Give me my fucking money back.  It's those guys. I'm sorry. It's not that I want you to take it easy. It's so badass. Oh, dude.  Tom Hardy, when you play it just came out yesterday. He plays Capone. Al Capone. Oh, it's on Amazon. Is it good? It misses the mark. I love Tom Hardy.  Did it so bad. How bad is it worth watching. No show get high first. Yeah, I'm sure it's fun. So is it like showgirls bad or like roadhouse bad?  Oh, dude, it's just it's just it's the last year of his life when he goes crazy from syphilis. Oh, and nothing.  It's just him being crazy in his mansion in Florida. It doesn't go back to the old school shit. Nothing.  Well are going to if you're going to tackle a subject that's that this crazy Lance Armstrong. Thirty four thirty if you can tell it, if you can tackle a subject, it's that crazy.  Like you got to you got to go deep. You go deep. Yeah.  You can't just dabble on the periphery of a subject. Well it's him. It's him because he, you know, his wife talked about how he was going crazy and talking to his old friends. He'd walk around and talk to his old friends, but they he's talking his old friends. And it will show like his old friends and him talk to him and be in the these. That's just like, what the fuck are we? But it's two hours of that.  Just him shitting his pants, piss in the bed and talk to his old friends. That's it. Fishing. I was so disappointed. Tom Hardy, so good.  Well, it's always who's writing the script, who's directing it.  And it's not just who's acting is as much of a bad motherfucker as Tom Hardy. You know, if they don't put together, it's like don't matter to do. And that's a magic. That's how you had to do your podcast.  He had a team of people leaning over your shoulder keeping you from saying preposterous shit that doesn't make any sense to trying to destroy the kind of trying you had the chairman on the on your part.  No, I have. How dare you?  Listen, I got nothing but love from all those people. But what they have to understand is they have a weird role that they really shouldn't have. They shouldn't have the ability to make the kind of decisions that they can make. Those kind of decisions are you can you can kind of decide that someone doesn't get to talk in the biggest platform, user generated platform in the world. And you go by your own standards.  That's not an easy job. Right.  But my point is, it seems as it goes, it seems to be a subject where there should it's so important to be able to express yourself. It seems to be a subject that we should have people from both sides work on some sort of agreement for what you can and cannot say and why you can't say those things and penalize people accordingly and then have a good time where they can come back. But that's something that's like the founding fathers figured this.  They did, but they didn't anticipate you can't say you can't anticipate the Internet being privately owned, so anything YouTube or a Twitter, they can just decide you.  It's just like what we're seeing with this California thing. You can't give any person the ability to irrationally control a bunch of other people if they don't agree with it.  That's right. They don't agree with it. It's really the rule of law, not rule by man rule of law in this extraordinary situation. It requires a vote.  And I guarantee you, if you had a vote for two two propositions, we let the government take care of everything and we drain all the billionaires and take all their money and just use that to feed everybody. And no one works ever again. Or we look at this rationally and we figure out a way to protect the vulnerable and we figure out a way to collectively restart our economy and save these small businesses and let all the big businesses know, listen, we are going to be really opposed to you if you just absorb all these small businesses.  And the only way to get tires is if you go to Wal-Mart or Sears or some big company and the mom and pop stores all disappear, like that's not good for anybody. This is some bullshit hater mentality. So there's two opportunities. There's an opportunity to be scared and to be more closed minded than ever before, or there's an opportunity to be more cooperative and more. One thing that people need to realize, this is a real important thing to think about.  How many people out there are living day to day and you don't even realize you were living day to day until they shut the water.  We know we know a lot of people. They shut the money off. You may come in. Come in, Major.  But you had a bad view of what reality is. You thought it was OK to just kind of spend just a little bit more than you need to spend. But the way the stores.  Well, I mean, I'm not the stuff that comes to work for all those people that never did anything wrong and they lost all their income, I feel for all of them.  But I think one thing that can come out of this is that people understand that there's no logic, real logic in stretching yourself out. If you know now we didn't know before. If you know now that it could all shut off, some people are shutting out, you know, just want to.  But they're living with their means. They're living. Just said is such an important point. Yeah. Because we cannot plan for that. Right. And some people can't plan. But if, you know, the government can shut you down. Yes. Like that, who's really going to invest? What does it to try to calm people's confidence is a huge thing. One of the great secrets of this country is we have a stable political atmosphere where you were you know, you have the right to your private property.  You know, there's due process, all these things. And when you have this kind of executive overreach, where where a mayor can arbitrarily with a couple of health bureaucrats, tack on an extra three months and and then you've got a stimulus bill that doesn't have a fucking prayer of passing through the Senate. All of a sudden we go, hey, disaster get hit arbitral. A politician could arbitrarily decide, fuck it and shut down your business. It's very difficult to plan for the future.  In that case, we've never faced anything like this. That's not representative government. That's the problem. That doesn't represent the people. And if it does represent the people, I would make a real strong argument that those people are misinformed. I would make the argument that those people are acting in fear when, look, if you're really, truly concerned about your health is one of two things going on. Either there's some sort of an issue, you have a medical issue or there's neglect.  And I think we need to look at those accordingly as well.  What what is more difficult for us to accept? Is it more difficult for us to accept that a virus kills old people, or is it more difficult to accept if it only kills people, smoke cigarettes, or only people who are overweight or only people who are alcoholics?  There's still less. But do we feel less bad if those people die? Well, I think there's always an element.  First of all, if you smoke, we know you have a much higher chance of getting cancer and a lot of other cancers. If you drink a lot, we know you have a much higher chance of getting cancers, dementia, a lot of other things. So we know that if you eat, you know, if you live on sugar and white flour, you have a higher chance of getting diabetes. There are lots of things you can do to really shorten your life span or create some misery in your body.  Right.  And I look at the sheer numbers of how many people, but a lot of that comes down to personal responsibility. And let me say this. That's really important. There is this very I think you and I were talking about this. There's people are terrified to say about any group or any person now that you are not where you should be because of you. The narrative on the left, the narrative on the left is you're not where you should be or you're down here because you have been victimized by a power structure.  You have never been given a chance and held out.  And so what that does is it takes all onus of responsibility off of a particular group or a particular individual.  And the problem with that is that it is true that there could have been some there's oppression and suppression of certain groups and certain groups are marginalized. Absolutely.  But to say that that's the only issue facing certain communities is that the truth and not and not held up.  That's just a symptom of people that had no real problems. When people people are designed to fix problems and to run away from danger. And when there's no real problem and no real danger, you find it like this is hate speech. This is dangerous people. People are really using the term in twenty nineteen violent speech.  That's right. I totally. About that on my podcast, Preposterous ideas for this pandemic, have you heard anything about the WOAK movement? Yeah, there's ramping up again. Are they just starting to ramp up again? Yeah, because now they're saying, no, we're getting out of it. They're broke, they're angry. They're just starting to ramp up again. I know we're coming out. They're frustrated, man. Everybody. But here's the thing. Even the the WOAK folks, I swear to God, who are the folks?  What is the Jesus right woak people does that? Well, you know, team freedom, you know, that's what people.  Oh, that's OK. That was different. Social justice or justice. That's not that's the right way. Do you not even listen to what I'm saying? I'm joking around.  You know how they're like, damn, I thought what was the other side the whole time? No, I got it wrong listening to Djokic. OK, no, no, you're not listening.  I'm saying you know how there's team freedom. Right? OK, well, there's also team work.  Yeah, I'm not saying the same thing, but what is out? What do they believe? Well, they're the social justice warrior, even inclusiveness and diversity, which why I can't the culture is also a wonderful way to say it. And if you're not inclusive enough, not diverse enough, they will fucking hate anything that she knew from there. Like, you know, the issue.  I don't even think that's the issue. I really do think the issue is that, look, we have we have a power structure in this country. This country was founded on things like slavery and genocide. Yes. To an extent, there was a lot of slavery and genocide in this country. The people had slaves are just rich people.  I need you to calm your White Bull. Slavery has been a for. I'm not enjoying your White Bull shit. You're white. Apologized to it when one commercial with the man's delivering barbecue to people wearing face masks.  You can't simplify arguments. That's all I'm saying. You got it. You got to take into account a lot of other things.  We're also longest any democracy may be, are we going to be allowed to go to a restaurant in Houston? It's like, yeah, you can. I can't wait, buddy. Yeah, you can go to restaurants in Texas.  Sorry to my buddy Adam Curry was telling me not last weekend with the weekend before they were already open, he sat down at a restaurant, a sit down meal we can past like we just got here on a wagon train fighting Indians are shooting arrows at as we're well, we're pulling up our brow.  It's going to come to Texas and Houston, I don't know. But they're opening Columbus. We want to see a crazy picture jam. We put that picture up fucking with me.  Send me a picture of Columbus. Columbus doesn't give a fuck. Ohio doesn't give a fuck. They have heard him already. You know, it was nuts. His cat sent me this. She goes, I was at Hunton Beach. How is. Because there wasn't one man sent me a picture, too.  Is that right? I like hunting. I might not have to thought, OK, yes.  You know. Players only love you when they're playing. People got to keep moving in this world. Look at that. Oh, look at that. It's not six feet long and there's not a mask in sight.  That's why that's how people are supposed to live. You should be celebrating all these not sick people out dancing. Yeah. What the fuck, folks?  That looks fantastic.  Plus, I hope the people that don't want us to go back to there, I get it. I don't know my dad either. OK, if I see you, I'll give you a hug. I don't know much. I let this go. We've got to move on. That's OK. You can't make everybody depressed with you. Yeah, I thought we all lost. But guess what? We're going to die. All of us. Nobody gets out alive.  Not wasting years.  We're wasting away years. Years.  It's basically like the metaphysical equivalent to like you're running and a guy falls down and scrapes his knee and you're like, come on, man, get up. He doesn't want to get up. But you know what else? I like it. I don't know if I should just just fucking abandon your ass and go home. Come on, man.  People that are in favor of like who love this social distancing are people that just don't like people a lot of times. So I think people are into this that no one wants to fuck. That's a very important, very important, very important.  It's often ignored. It is true that that's a hundred percent of the line right there.  If you're if you're born and you have a birth defect or some something wrong with you. So it's not sarcastic or you're not you don't look good. Your bad genes are this. That's why we have to have compassion for people that don't agree with you. You don't know you're beautiful. Is that what you say? I'm looking I was talking about him. I was like, I feel bad for you. And he was like, oh, you were damaged because I can talk here.  Let me show you some pictures of, you know, your old man T-shirt under three layers that I always got. Extra are white t shirt and a sweatshirt on, bro. We weren't looking any layered up.  Are you camping right now? No, dude, I'm just wearing my cashmere sweater.  Do you ever go back and think about the time that you and I in 2012 went went hunting with Rinella, Missouri breaks the time stand up comics.  Never been hunting Hillary haven't haven't camped since I was in the fucking Boy Scouts and these kids from the inner city tried to do here schifrin's here shivering.  I could hear him talking. He's going to lose his teeth. He didn't like the ten. Next, me and I, he goes like this. He goes, he goes, we come on. I go, Hey, you guys camping? Blow it.  Did you say you were shaking? We were in Alaska in the morning. He was shaking so bad he was going like this. He was talking and he's hearty. He won't fucking tell you but he's so he's going like this. And he was shaking so much that his lips, his lips, his lips, his lips. Shoo, shoo, shoo, shoo. He's got big fucking lips. His hope is usually the reason I love those trips is we laughed so hard we got struck by one.  You know, it was really great about that trip, particularly to Alaska. There was one day where it didn't rain. I'm not bullshitting. And that one day, Laurice was it was it Mike, one of the other guys that was working on the crew figured out that you could burn Fritos and that Fritos.  Yeah, really flammable. Flammable. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That we use Fritos because they burn, they stay, they stay lit for a while and we take little pieces of wood and we made this little fire little pieces.  So it was kind of wet, the wood was kind of wet, but we kept the Fritos going and the wet wood would dry out as it would heat up and then then it would dry out other pieces. We just hit it real slow. Doesn't give a shit.  Watch just yesterday we're Attaran Tactical and we're shooting. He's shooting.  He's new to do 80 20 left hand. Right hand. Yeah, pretty much. Did I have my secrets to you doing. I have my shooting belief system. Don't worry about it. We're shooting fifty fifty earlier. Yeah I was ignorant. I'm fifty five. I don't know. Come on. You've got to be where it looks.  Right hand is loose, right hand is thirty seven.  So. So Branden's like this and he's shooting, he's like, he's kind of missing. Somebody are using a fork and then I go come over here. So we have the leads are going to go. So when you're shooting with two eyes, see the site, see the site there.  And then he goes like this, he goes you're like John Dick. All right. Not even oh by the way, all these guys, all these guys are he's shooting. He's not even a good tactical. I'm like, no Cossette Camela shit about you dumb piece of shit. He's a nice guy. Underwear fucking nice guy.  Well, everybody, there's a nice guy. They have a great place. Yeah. You know, and Taron, I'm very grateful to him, you know, like teaching us. It's nice. Great. We can go there and teach you not just proper technique but safety and tell you about how the gun works.  And I learned so much shock. I was like this. I go, so just look to the side and just cool. Now, do you think I'll. Care less about this way, more or less about the other way, about when, how about when he timed him and he shot what is how many places that 67 plates until you can see it.  He's so fast. It's weird, but it is not just fast, stupid, accurate. Yeah, well, it takes me like 14 seconds. Takes him five minutes.  Well, that's why they came to him to train Keanu Reeves. It was ten o'clock on you leave and I'm just the son of a bitch. I know someone's ready to bail.  I'm going to go time here. Four hours in four hours from here on the bus. Know, I did. I think we finally did some Librium.  Listen, I'm just happy that you invite me to show you this. We're watching right here.  We're watching baseball somewhere in the world. So they just started up again. Yeah.  No audience, no fans have been shown up beer pong the last couple of nights. This cornhole. This ain't a best seller for content.  They are, but this ain't what they have.  Beer pong cornstalk cornhole championship's. Oh, don't be stupid, bitch. The thing that's awful.  Oh, God. Is that really all we can do is sports so bad it's too dangerous to start with this.  You wouldn't you would think that there's too many things leaning in favor of open things up. Too many businesses are closed.  What's going on? Like those glasses? One person in the middle, you get a piece of some.  Brian, how how how effective are what tests actually are the most effective?  Well, apparently the they draw your blood. Ellen was saying that that is the most comprehensive and then second place would be to detect an active virus. They do the swab. They go up into your nose like it's crazy.  It's like literally probably about five inches in your nose. I can't do that. That hurts. You can do it. I'm not doing you can you bitch. I did it twice.  I'm telling you, I bet you have one numb nostril. You've been punched a bunch. I have, yeah. So if you have one nostril, just shove it in that bitch. My right one is the go to nostro from now on. Yeah.  The problem with sparring like I still do a little of it and you don't realize you're getting hit even if you're moving out of the pro because he's just tapping you. But then you feel it later.  Yeah.  You know, so it's getting so you're in your head, your head is you know, you know, it's weird man when it hurts to eat, when you chew and I don't do that shit. I've gotten caught in the jar a couple of times. I don't get that in jujitsu too. Right. Fork that's where it hurts to eat like I'm getting for never. It's never happened to me. Way too good.  You're too young to get caught up in this area, areas like the DMZ. Let's get out of there. Now that is in this area. I wanted to ask you this. I wanted to make a point. I leave. How's your back? How's here the lower back?  You know what? They didn't inject my back with stem cells. They don't do that. They injected my knee and my shoulder. And so my back is the same, but intravenous as well, right? No, yeah.  Yeah. I don't I don't feel anything from that. How long has it been. I don't think I don't think that did anything. Maybe if it did, it's something you don't really notice. But I do notice the shoulder because we got I got direct hits right into the shoulder in the knee. And at first the first couple of months with my knee was weird because I had meniscus surgery and I had all these all of a sudden these new pops and cracks all up in my knee and like, you know, you know, you have a relationship with your knee, you know, which cracks.  And, you know, I could spin and you know what I mean. But every now and then, like, new cracks would come up like, I don't know what's going on. I remember the doctor calling for a follow up and I'm like the shoulders feeling all right. It was like at the three month mark. But my knee, I told him it's all there's all these weird new cracks in my knee. I don't know what it is.  So if the stem cells actually are working for the knee, though, that would mean that the meniscus was was being rebuilt. Yeah. So maybe the cracks. I told the doctor maybe these cracks are like what's happening because it's in the middle of reconstruction.  I don't know. I don't know. But it's cracking. It's making these weird noises. I don't know what's going on.  But now those cracks are gone and my knee feels a little bit like maybe that shit really fucking works because if I fix my shoulder, it doesn't fix my fuck. Yeah, your shoulder feels great.  You know, my story fixed my shoulder for sure. I had a full length rotator cuff tear. It went away.  I got a second MRI. It was like eight months later in Santa Monica. Right. He's very good. Doctor Banro. He's amazing. Yeah, he said lifespan medicine. Santamonica, he's I've been going to him forever. He's incredible. He's also I think what's important with all these doctors is that this is an ever changing environment, like the technology, the medical technology. They're just constantly coming up with new and better techniques on your pockets.  In five years, we may have things that are all they all say that I'll see when I'm with the amount. I'm like, get on this. Keep hearing about what is the asteroids? What about NORAD or whatever that. Yes, no, that I did that to Jamie and I've been this part of the treatment we've been doing EL'AD every week. I do. Yup, yup. I do every week. And I do a IV bag of vitamins every week.  How do you feel here in the studio. Yeah. Peptides. Yeah. Yeah. Do peptides too. But what a peptide. I'm doing a book one five seven.  No you got the other doctor and just hit you all at once. Yes. What day.  Yes I do a different days. What do you depending on where. Right here. They do it in the green room. They set up a A thing concierge L.A. they come in and a fucking hazmat suit and they and they should do a Viking penguin.  I like get in shape. And then I talk a talk while we're get I've decided the day after a fight of it and I feel better.  My body's you know, I don't. Wow. What if you did a while. It's such a distraction because the needles in your arm, you're weirded out by it.  No, but if you're not watching fights, it's just like us getting ivied. And I didn't. It hurts. It hurts a little bit. Then you try. I do that every day. Hurts like that. My my real. My goal is to get it under ten minutes here. I've got it down to thirteen minutes. Thirty minutes. A bag. It just feels like complete shit. Your stomach feels like your guts are on fire.  You feel so you feel like the worst stomach ache. That's good. You feel great. You but not everybody.  That's I did it five days straight and that and.  Right but how long was your I.V.. How long did it take to like did it for man. I don't remember exactly, but it was maybe an hour.  Yeah. Yeah. Well it's a lot easier. Yeah. See, the idea is the quicker you open up the ramp, the valve on the I.V., the more it hurts. So if you do an hour, the first time I did it was now it's like kind of mildly uncomfortable. Not that big a deal. But I'm like, how hard can you make it? And I go opening up all the way. So the nurse open up all the way.  I was like, oh my God, this is crazy. It hurts you like your guts, man.  Your guts shot into your chest and everything feels weird. Everything you just get it just gets real heavy. It's it's tough.  So me, since I'm a I'm a moron, I decided I want to see how fast I can get that shit through my system. I want to feel the brunt of it, the full wake.  I want to feel the worst it feels and just open it up just to feel that way. It's I don't know man has something to do with like acids in your stomach.  So tough. It feels terrible. And, you know, here's what's crazy.  The moment it's over, the moment it's over, it's gone. And then you feel better.  You feel like not. And part of you like, OK, how much of this is. I'm just feeling better because something sucked. Like when we were in Montana, I remember we went to that the that motel in Billings and we took a shower in that terrible motel and then we to eat afterwards.  This is the best shower ever, ever, you know, a regular shower.  And you've always said this. You know, I've had shower conversation so many times.  I've never taken showers together. No, no, no, I didn't mean that.  But I mean, where you like to back where you said this once you like, imagine if there was no showers, that you couldn't take a hot shower.  You take a hot shower for granted. There is no river hot shower. Oh, yeah. We got a got down in a fucking frigid river. Yeah. Imagine I wash my things in the thirteen hundreds.  Like for them to have the ability to have a hot shower like waiting for my minutes.  I could stay in my shower for thirty minutes. Easy.  That hot water didn't have that shit that the kings didn't even have that shit. Oh they had in Rome. These crazy bathhouses though man.  It's really interesting when some whiskey to be taken one you get ready to leave, it's going to go to waste. Boys, this is the first thing we've done since the lockdown. Do you understand this? We have a fight every week. It's been awesome. We can have we can have fun every week.  We can say to each other and then we should do a hunt.  We should now move to Texas. I'll do it. Houston. Yeah, California. Start doing shit. Do you guys have good times? You have stuff a good time in Houston as far as comedy goes. Is it extra special in Texas, Roxanne?  For Tony, as far as Houston is the first place I ever recorded an album.  So it's extra special.  Totally do extra special. It's yeah. For me and Sam when we go out, there are a bunch of personal reasons why.  Houston, Houston, for a bunch of personal reasons, it's important to me. And also like that, that was the club where I first really started poppin on the road was the club where Kinnison used to work out of and Bill Hicks used to work out of an old lady there, too. Yeah, it was a thing where I was there and I realized that I just missed this era where like in the eighties that that place was the shit, you know, like people were going to Houston to learn to do stand up in that outlaw way.  You know how many guys came from their car, Bo, Jimmy, Pineapple? All those guys had traveled around with Kinnison. I think they were all from that. I don't know if I don't know if Karl Lobo was from Houston, but he definitely performed. There there was a lot of guys that were out of that place is a different vibe. There was a wild vibe. I've had good times, but then that one club went under.  It was so crazy. You watch one club go under and then the whole system falls apart. And there's the Houston Improv, which is really good. And I know you guys are there. But the thing is, like you need a bunch of local clubs to build town. If you want to have local local talent, you can't have one club.  You can't dominate if you want to keep your own. It's a crazy. View, but it's contrary to a business, people think. But the only way to operate a comedy club successfully is to help all the other comedy clubs. Because you want talent, you want a lot of talent.  And if you only make it so that your club succeeds, you're going to have a limited amount of talent. You're going to have a tyrannical reign over that talent, and it's going to suppress their creativity. And contrary to where you're thinking you're going to do this, it's going to actually hurt you and hurt your business. Right.  I think it's far as excuse my players performs Santonio saucily.  I he has got great yeasted that they said to my hotel, you San Antonio Club, they're it's ridiculous and not how cities will say to capture these.  Amazing. But I love all Texas. I love Houston. I love Dallas. I love Austin. I would love in all those planes. Yes.  The thing about Austin is Austin is like it's a nice combination of cowboy and hippie.  Yeah. You know, crazy hipsters. That's crazy is that it's slowly becoming like kind of like cool to be like the want to live in Texas little by little last year.  How much? A million watts. Half a million Californians moved to Texas last year.  But the Texans are right when they say, hey, you're going to come over here and fuck this place up with the same voting. Right, right, right.  I don't blame a lot of people saying that's happened in Nevada. I don't blame Texas. You know, California is like a lot of California, Nevada, Nevada is right there. People just drive. There was a shit in the back seat and like, let's try again.  People are like leaving California. It's a good thing to talk about taxes.  I mean, that's they fucked because they also let us know that we could do everything like through Zoom and, you know, we could do everything through. That's what's crazy.  We can do everything that we have to be in L.A.. No, it's an illusion. Illusion.  The only thing they all got caught up. There's two things. Stand up here.  You guys keep me here and the store keeps me here. It's true. But if you guys want to move somewhere else and we want to do comedy somewhere else, we could do it.  We could get together people and live near. We could bring other people in.  We could literally start a comedy club. We can invest in a current comedy club and help them. We could start a new ones. We can bring in our friends and give them a giant chunk of the money and just try to stimulate the business. Not even worry about us making money from the comedy club, but worry about promoting comedy in this new place that would get my my back.  Well, all in all, we wanted to do is break.  Even if we just if we just made a decision like here, here's what I want to do. We're going to move to a town and we're going to make a comedy club. But it's a fucking shitty business model. The business model is we just want a break. I don't want to make any money.  It's like, oh, yeah, we want to engage your comedy store or like like a rough in a lot of ways and a lot of ways engage the audience like engage the comics, like get everybody like, look, we've got a community here, we're going to do this for the art form because this is how without Wendy from the comedy works in Denver wouldn't have seen that lady's amazing show. That's why I did my Comedy Central special. They're in 2014.  I want to honor this lady at this club. It's like the reason why Denver has a scene. So sometimes it does come down to one person does, but it can come down to us. I would do it. We can go somewhere. Great.  What about your kids? School friends? Listen, man, I'm ready to start. Young people. Kids are cool everywhere, man.  Kids are cool everywhere, you know, and there's there's a little bit of good about learning from the adversity. A little cooler in Texas as long as you get love. Look, people are nicer in Texas, too. That's another thing. I mean, I hate stereotyping because they're not all nicer, but they're very polite. They're there's there's there's some benefits to not having people tell you what to do. That's that's the problem that we're all experiencing right now.  And this is the real issue, the benefits of people not telling you what to do or giant.  It's the only way you get anything done, because otherwise your resources are dedicated to dealing with this one person, suppressing your freedom of speech or suppressing the way you live your life or stopping you from going to work because you have to wear a fucking mask. You can't be that close to people and you're losing your business and come back, come down to Venice or Santa Monica or those areas and take a look at the homeless situation.  Come up, Brentwood, the tent. It's crazy.  Jamie has a tent set up. They got to break the homeless six feet apart. But the homeless, well, they put them in Brentwood, bro. This is so crazy by the VA center. They set up these outdoor camps that are socially dist.. So you have the camps where people are willing in the inside to follow the rules. Then just outside its other tents, I'm just regular homeless folk like fuck your rules. Here's my friend Willie. He's almost two.  I'm gonna hang out over here. He's in there.  What about washing their hands? Whatever is they said, you know, they said. The city is on that, no. A judge in L.A. just ordered that's why there are a lot of the homeless are off the street right now. He just ordered that these homeless encampments have to be taken down and they have to be put into its operation to keep Damien Monk meth.  I see I see the highest every day. I drive in downtown and do nothing about the homeless. They're fucking everywhere in the same spot.  They just did, but they just did in the past week. I know.  I think the guys every day, I think was homeless. Yes.  I think it's a lot like my fighters who are slugger's if you see them when they're in their prime, you say, well, it looks like it's working out.  And if they choose to just go face first way into like it seems like it's working out. But I find that homeless person five years later when their tent has a bunch of holes in them and the heroin starting to eat away. The liver disaster. Yeah. Find that person then find them then. Yeah.  All right boys, I we to go. I love you guys. You hate us. No I don't.  Listen, I swear I felt like this show like I drank water after I was in the desert. I know dude.  Like I feel like I can. Can we do another one next week. Yes we can keep doing, let's just do whatever movie we don't stop. This is who we are. What we do when no one else is there to do this, and also if we weren't even really good friends, imagine imagine someone trying to recreate this this fucking stupidity.  But I like it. I like the pony club. It's not a bad idea. It's not a bad idea. And I think the place to do it would be in a place like Texas. You know, you just you have to do it in a place where the business rules are good and you do it with a good ethic. But the ethic of the the ethic is like setting up a place like the old laff stop. You guys didn't really work to old Laff stop in River Oaks, but the old Laff stop was a magical place and you would be on stage in one day.  You had one room that was like the, I guess the main room, and then they had a side room by the bar that they would do an open mic night. They would go on to like two o'clock in the morning. So it was amazing.  It was a real it was a real community. It was run by one crazy dude who was like part owners, a lot of a lot of nonsense attached to it.  But that's OK. I mean, but that's always that's always how it is. When you're creating good comedy, you don't get good comedy out of people with, like, rational person. You need misfits. We're all misfits.  Misfits. Come on, man. Misfits. I mean, there are things I try to get a bunch of comics involved in this thing. I was trying to do not have showed up.  But comedy was easy when George W. Bush was president. Oh, man, that was easy.  But you guys understand, if we just decided to up and move to like Austin together, no bullshit. We just decided to do that. We could we could ignite a community. That's not bullshit. We could bring there's a lot of comics from L.A. that don't want to be here anymore. They're tired of this. They try to give up a giant chunk of their money in taxes. All these draconian laws that are you can't go outside your house that a mask on or you risk a ticket.  Like, when are you going to live this? When is this over? Are you sure you know what the fuck you're doing?  There's a lot of people that feel that way, a lot of people in that line and Whole Foods and they man but all of them. And 80 percent of the people at the airport, you didn't have to wear face masks at the airport. Do you do 80 percent. You have to wear a mask in the airport.  No, I don't wear it on a plane. No, you're not going on a plane you have to wear in the air.  No, not I didn't I was I was just in the airport. I went to Jacksonville. Yeah. And it doesn't have to come lazed. I didn't have to wear shit. No one told me I never wore one.  Good for you. I don't know what the point of that was.  80 percent of the you didn't have to wear would trust. No one ever said anything to me. I said to next to a couple on the plane, they're like twenty three year old nice couple. They had their masks on the whole goddamn time. I didn't, I'm like, it's not mandatory.  I went, oh God damn diaper. But I find it so claustrophobic. Are you kidding me. Very mandatory H1N1.  No. With all this nonsense that's going on how everything just got real haywire and the world's not what it used to be just a few months ago for us to be able to get together and just talk shit.  I know. Just get fucked up.  And a shout out to Eddie, one of my favorites said for three months ago, if he had said if edited, said five months ago. And he was like, he's like, ad bro, I'm telling you right now, fuck you, fuck open for him.  The impressions are worse than him. I'm pretty good at six feet apart and cover our mouths, bro. I know it's been like he's crazy, crazy. He's caught flat and they're going to be chasing us on our phones. It's worse than flattering.  I would be we're going to sign up for it and they're going to let dudes microchip them because they want to work at the shipping and people are going to embrace the Bill Gates vaccine.  They can't wait for it for something that kills eighty year olds. I can't wait for this vaccine. It's my fish kills eighty year olds. Does that make sense? It's my favorite.  We've talking about a vaccine right now. I mean, why the guy yells out that Bill Gates is the devil. He's got to put it all these people, like we won't open the accounts. She said Huntington Beach was fucking packed, bro. It's going to get Malibu is packed.  I drove up to Malibu yesterday. It real bad all over Malibu. We're done. We're done all over. Fuck.  Yeah. You know, thing I'm just scared that they got something that they mad. It's so political.  And they they're holding onto this locked down for a reason. You think they're doing it for our health. Come on. Don't you think this is about our weakness and they're going to drop in.  Bin Laden's son you think about is going to be like they care about the health bill. I love you. I love you guys. All right, listen, we made it happen. Good night. Oh, thank you. Thank you for my life. You listen.  It's so much more. It felt really good to do this voice. Oh, I know. Yeah. We went too long.
