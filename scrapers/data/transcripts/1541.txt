It's my absolute favorite way to cook trigger grills make the food delicious and it's simple to use, but it's a super well engineered machine.  It's a pellet grill.  And what a pellet grill is, is it uses hardwood sawdust. So if you bought oak or cherry, they would make sawdust out of that. And then they use the sawdust and compress it using the natural sugars in the wood to hold it together. And then you just pour those pellets into a hopper. The hopper feeds into a worm drive and the worm drive feeds it to a heating outlet and it just cooks just fire and wood. It sounds complicated, but it's very easy to use and they have an amazing application.  The application on your phone has 1500 plus recipes and you can control your grill from anywhere. It also has recipes where you can navigate the cook cycle through the recipe on the app. It's amazing. There's twelve different wood pellet varieties, big game blend, hickory, mesquite, apple, cherry, pecan, alder, oak, maple and more. Trager owns its own lumber mills. The wood pellets are made here in the good ol U.S. of A. And they're available online or in 10000 plus stores nationwide.  I can't recommend them enough.

Please give it up for the great and powerful Bridgitte Fantasy Girl podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day.  Oh, hello, Bridget.  Well, we're going to save the world.  Yeah, that's right.  Now, I'm sorry for being late for the most California reason ever. I really I thought I was meditating for 20 minutes and I was 45 minutes and I was like, what happened last time we talked?  You hadn't even started meditating yet. So tell me about this.  Well, I would do it occasionally, but you weren't most of the time I was getting in the tank and just kind of like meditating.  But, you know, the tank is its own thing. Yeah. But, yeah, I've been doing I had this guy, James NÃ©stor. He's the author of Breathe, Breathe, Breathe, Breath, Breath, Breath, Breath. The book, his breath.  I always forget which ones has the E at the end, but I really got into breathing exercises afterwards. And so I mean, I'm calling it meditating, but I'm really doing both a meditating and doing while I'm doing these breathing exercises. I'm just concentrating on breath.  It is dripping. It is the best fucking stretch weaver. It just goes away.  I mean, yoga. And I always said, if you could if you had to choose like all all the different parts of that practice, if I had to tell somebody just to do one, it would be the breathing exercises are the best.  Yeah, there's something about it too, that like you don't realize how shallow your breath is most of the day until you sit down. You do these. I do six in six hours or six seconds and big mouth and then.  And I did it for 45 minutes today, just in and out, and by the end, my, my my skin is tingling, like I feel high.  Yeah, it's wild. I know.  That's why I love that. I was mentioning the last time I was on Sam Harris's meditations, because they have you reflecting on your own consciousness. It's like notice, you know, pay attention to where you're paying attention or what. It's so trippy and I'll get in my head.  And next thing you know, I'm like, this is like taking acid. I love Sam Harris.  I was terrified of the prophet, though. Is he?  Yeah, he's not doing anything life, really. Oh, Sam.  He's the one who had me so come out and play Sam.  But he knew somebody, though that got it early in Italy and got really sick. Yeah.  But then upon questioning I was asking him a bunch of things, like the guy was drinking, like I was partying and then he was skiing and then covid.  So the people that I know that have got it and got it bad were all compromised. Yeah. They were all beaten down, worn out and then it got them. That's where it gets good.  Or you don't know. We had a friend whose boyfriend's brother died of it and he got it, but he was sick for two weeks and his wife was like please go.  And he didn't because he's a dude. And and then he went and found out that he had like diabetes or something. He didn't even know he had it. And so he was compromised. And it was really tragic and sad.  But a nurse was telling us she was Maharshi.  Yeah, she's right. She's do I get that? She's she's great. I love her. But anyway, when she's doing the tests, she's telling us about all these kids that vap that are.  Oh yeah. I've been hearing this fucking getting pneumonia and dying from vaping. Here's a fun story. I was talking to my physical therapist and he is married to an Italian woman. So they were hearing all the stories from Italy and then all the whole thing about like hydrochloric hydrochloric when came out and hydroxy or the Hydroxycut queen.  How, however the hell you say it.  And he he had been hearing from the people in Italy that this was kind of working with like them and that was helping. So after Trump said it was helping, he was trying to get some on the west side.  And he's like all these motherfuckers here are talking shit about it.  You couldn't get anywhere on the west side of L.A., every rich person in L.A. went out and bought it and then was like, oh, this we shouldn't be listening to this. He's like, but you couldn't get it anywhere.  Well, my doctor told me that people are not taking it because they hate Trump. Oh, well, he learned shop.  Got it. They asked shop what your political leanings are. He's like, what? And he's like, well, hydroxy chloroquine has been proven to be very effective in the early, especially early.  Yeah, he was fucking give it to me. What are you talking about. But imagine if you like football. I'm going to die literally die on this hill. Trump People have lost their minds, lost their minds.  It's it's a I saw a tweet yesterday. I was like, I'm so tired, I'm so tired.  I'm like, what are you this whole idea of everybody being like, I'm so exhausted. Like you're I fucking ass. You're watching Netflix, you're on your couch, you're waiting for Postmus. It's like, are you fucking tired? You're exhausted from tweeting, you know, like it's so hard educating all these people, all these fascist online all day.  What do you fucking exhausted from? I don't understand.  Can fascist everybody who disagrees with you is a fascist. Everyone, that's just how it is everywhere.  And it's I was talking to Colin Quinn for my podcast and we were talking about this.  I was like, do you not get shit for like he's like I feel like we're kind of in the same place. And I was like, don't get shit for being like both sides.  And he was like, isn't that insane, though?  Like the people who are like trying to see things reasonably are the ones who are like getting attacked. He's like, no, the middle used to be the people looking at the zealots being like, you're fucking crazy. And now they're looking at us and they're like, you guys need to be stopped.  The middle of this reason needs to be stopped.  Well, because you make them confront their own biases.  Yeah, that's what the problem is when you're if you're a reasonable person, especially especially if you're someone like you or I who has a platform and you're reasonable and there's a lot of people listening and then people like, well, she's actually got some good points.  No, she doesn't. She's a fascist.  Like, I know Alyssa Milano. I don't have a platform like you guys, but well, it's a real shame that her platform was a third of mine.  That's like a really, really delusional.  I want to this is the two plus two equals five, Matt. Yeah, that math is that's like Hollywood math when they tell you the movie didn't make any money.  Yeah, yeah. It's it's really wild watching the hatred that people who are. Even so, the other day, I saw I'll say something like. I've heard because I put out an article and it was like, why I don't why I'm not voting for the president, like, fuck this, I'm out. And I got all these emails like 900 emails in two days from people who are conservative, voting for Biden, from people who are Democrats. And I'm saying I'm like I'm hearing a lot of people saying that they've never voted for Trump or considered it.  And they're going to and they're like, that's propaganda.  I was like, so anything you don't want to hear is propaganda. Like, I'm just reporting what I'm hearing anecdotally from people. And you're telling me it's propaganda, which it's really the opposite of propaganda.  No, the problem is the the media overwhelmingly is liberal, right?  Overwhelmingly like there's Fox News.  And what's that?  Eoin was chewing on them or whatever. Whatever it is, this one is one crazy network, an American network. Oh, yeah. All right. On the edge of the cliff with a fucking eagle tattoo on their back.  And then you have everything else. I mean, everything else is liberal, whether it's whether they pretend to be or not. They lean liberal, whether it's NBC, CBS, MSNBC, of course, CNN, CNN is CNN's atrocious.  This is what they're so bad. There used to be my favorite source of news. And now I see when when you see Don Lemon and Chris Cuomo talking about white people and how like white people have every advantage, like, why don't you have an education? Why don't you have a loan? Like Chris Cuomo is just standing there, like letting Don Lemon say is like, what are you guys talking about?  Their parody? Have you ever been to Appalachia? No, they have. Do you know about really poor white people? There there there's poor white people all over the world.  I tweeted something about crazy. They're like Don Lemon's calling out celebrities and I'm here for it. And I was like, Don Lemon is the arsonist standing in the house asking for everyone else to put out the fire. Like what? This guy has been so divisive. He's so what are you even talking about? Generalizations.  All of them do nobody any good.  No, but they're fun. But I just made one. I know, but they're so fine. They're are very fun. I mean, we're we're comics. Yes, we have.  In the world of generalizations, I said this waitressing stereotypes don't exist in a void. Like as a waitress, it was 10 percent waitressing, 90 percent trying not to profile people.  And that was the hardest part of my job.  Bias training is just like, all right, these white ladies aren't going to be a pain in the ass, these Whiteley's Åafak.  But they're funny.  And but the fact that you could say that on CNN, you could say something ridiculously biased and in a gross generalization on CNN, as long as you're saying it about the right people, whether you're mocking all Trump supporters are being dumb.  You remember when he did that and there was this whole thing where they said I was not mocking them.  I like the red light. Yes, he was like fake laughing. Yeah, it was like it was so not funny. I was like, what is this?  It was like when you go to one of those alt rooms and someone's laughing at some shit that, you know, nobody thinks is really funny, like what is happening here? What is this weird voodoo in the air forcing people to comply?  I think one of the things that really was surprising to me that I'm hearing from a lot of people and in my next column, I kind of talk about this is like the the mainstream media inadvertently red pill, a huge sector of America during the pandemic. Oh, yeah.  Because they were like, lock up. This is for the best. Shut your business down. Don't bring your kids to school. Mass funerals, mass weddings, mass graduations, mass sports, mass comedy, mass, everything treating.  Did you see that? I know.  And then they were like, oh, but protests are OK. And everyone and you know how many people protested?  Like, what percentage was it like what point? One percent.  Enough to spread the virus and no good solid number. How about de Blasio? He said the only protests you could do, Black Lives Matter protests like, hey, motherfucker, this is America.  Yeah. You can't do that.  No, you can't say it was is a parody, though. How is he even really. He can't be real. Gambusia South Park are living in a South Park. We are.  It's and so yeah I keep hearing this from people that that was you know, I don't even think it was a protest because I think most people are actually on board, especially around George Floyd.  Everyone was pretty united. Like this is horrific. Yes. We need to address this. Police brutality is a problem.  Someone should have stepped up, though. Some mayor should have stepped up and said, I am with you, but we are going to have a real problem with health.  If we just all gather in a street like this and it's not even in the street.  It's the making posters beforehand at your buddies house, you know, and like getting together afterwards and having drinks.  Everybody was still getting together in apartments and houses before and after these projects.  And it's interesting. It's just that the thing I keep hearing is not even it's not even the protests. It's the rioting. And when you are standing in front of a burning building and you're saying these are mostly peaceful, people fucking have eyes, right?  You are lying to their face, and I just think they overplayed their hand, they I think you're right, that CNN piece had said how the riots are being misconstrued by right wing media while they're mostly peaceful. Right. And they made that with a photo of a building on fire.  Is it is so crazy how gaslighted that is. That's the biggest gaslighting event of our time.  It's actually just demanding that you swallow the lie. It's even worse than gaslighting. It's just demanding you comply with the lie that they're presenting. Now, we get this on the right to. Yes, where it's like I yell directly contradicts something that is clearly on video that you said climate change.  Climate change is the biggest one on the right.  Were they just full on try to deny climate change? And it's a part of the narrative of the ideology of the right. There's a lot of people that just deny the narrative of climate change.  They're young Republicans who are changing this, though, and you should have some of them on because they're young, some names. Well, there are some young kids who are really pushing back against.  They don't like that. They believe that we should conserve our parks, that we should conserve that it's important. And they hate that it's become this kind of partisan thing and that it's now Republicans are anti climate is this messaging. And so there there are some young people in that space. They just don't have a big enough voice really yet. But they're they're out there and they're pushing back against that. And they have some really cool things that are going going on.  Well, that's good, because there does need to be some pushback. The problem with the narrative on the right is that they're so pro-business that they're willing to sacrifice some environmental standards and people see the repercussions of that. Right.  They're like, hey, listen, I understand that you want people to be able to work. You want people to make a living, and you want to raise a standard and trickle down economics and all that shit.  But you can't you can't sacrifice the fucking environment.  Right like that should be a no brainer. First, do no harm, right? Like a doctor. First, do no harm. And that you're doing harm. Like you can't make money while you're polluting. But that's that's not good for anybody's future.  Yeah. They're seeing this in areas where, you know, I think it was reading like the Louisiana belt. There's like tons of instances of more covid mortality.  And they like Chemical Ali where all those fucking chemical plants are. And that's the kind of untold cost and cause and effect that we need to pay more attention to.  And this is why I hate when these things like the climate shouldn't be. We should be able to have a conversation about this.  And I think with the right wing, it's it's more that it's used as a cudgel to silence everybody. And you're supposed to just get on board. And there's so many things that are a lot of them will agree that we might be having some effect on it. But what is the best way to to try and make those changes? So that nuanced conversation is what needs to happen. And everything is just partisan.  Everything, even the mass thing, like all all of it.  And you want to be able to come from a place of facts. It's the same with, you know, police brutality, all of these things.  If we can start with what the actual facts are, that would be awesome and productive. But we don't we don't start there.  We start with, well, the police brutality thing. All you get is videos of horrific actions. You know, I saw the video.  There's a really terrible video that's going around right now that people are using as evidence that cops are racist because they didn't shoot this white guy who wound up shooting and killing a cop in Oklahoma. Did you see it?  Oh, I haven't seen it. I've been successfully offline. Every time I drink coffee with cream, I say I'm not going to do that again because I do it on the podcast. Then I get Flem and I have to.  And that's all right. It makes you human.  Just sad for people listening to annoying bro. But it's a bad video.  They pull this guy over. They maysam they they hit him with the pepper spray, they tase him, they do everything and he's just drugged up or a psycho who knows.  And they get into some sort of a wrestling exchange and he gets the cop's gun and unloads into this guy's body.  Here, the cop you from the cop's body camera, you see him get shot and you see him scream. This is the fucking thing about our dystopia that I hate. I've seen someone die like every day for the past two weeks online. You know, here's my point this.  People are looking at this thing, oh, the cops are racist because if there was a black guy, they would have shot them. Right. My position is, OK, this is these are two totally different cops. And maybe they didn't shoot him because they would have never shot anybody.  I mean, maybe these cops never would have shot a black guy or white or Asian guy or anybody.  But the point is, this is how dangerous it is to be a cop. Right. And this is why not only this two cops on one guy and they can't control this motherfucker. Yeah. And this is why non-lethal methods are the cops are reluctant to use them sometimes. Yeah. And this is also it just shows you how fucking hard it is to be a cop.  You get this crazy dude and you can't take. You can't pepper spray him, he still gets your gun and shoots and kills one of you. It was fucking nuts. It is nuts. I mean, it's and I think you can't really jump to, oh, this is racism with no evidence of racism.  Right. In that case, there is no racism. Right. Well, what they're saying is, as far as we know, if this was a black guy, they would have shot him.  And I understand why they feel like that, because there are all these videos of black guys getting shot by cops and it is horrible.  But this situation is two totally different human beings. That's the problem. It's in a generalization. The problem is and stereotypes, the problem is in the fat with the real problem is that these fucking cops exist at all, that wood would shoot a guy that's black just because he's black. Yeah, those guys are real. Yeah. Those cops are there. And there's so many cops out there that have PTSD, so many cops out there that they just don't know what is going on and they'll just shoot.  And there's a lot of that. Yeah. And I mean, I had I've had people writing me saying, like, I, I work with cops and they need better training. You know, they the cops themselves will say we need more training and to act like some of them are racist, is delusional, is acting like all of them are. You know, I think you have to take it on a case by case basis. Honestly, the thing that Sam did you listen to Sam Harris is our line thing that that everyone should listen to that very good.  You know, it's based very much.  And and what we know as far as facts, because he's like super reasonable.  Yeah. And it was that I sent it to, like, my dad, who's super, you know, my my left my center left people in my life. And he was like, that was very good.  You know, I don't think you hear that perspective right where Sam's Sam's a brave man.  Sam Harris is a brave man because he's already been attacked so many times for having these unconventional but very reasonable positions. And yet he still puts them out there and he knows before he puts them out there that he's going to get some flak and get some. But he's he deleted his Twitter from his phone. He doesn't have Twitter on his phone. I don't have it on my phone. Yeah.  Doing things like that can have a big impact. I was talking shop today. He's deleted all social media from his phone. He doesn't have any social media in his life anymore.  Yeah, I really only use Twitter and I only have it on my desktop so that if I'm I can only check it when I'm like in front of a computer.  I know that's even worse though, because then you should be writing. Yeah. I mean, I like that might be a problem too. I'm, I just need to delete it completely.  I think I'm going to get a computer that doesn't connect to the Internet.  I think, you know, like from 1980, you know, they have those like Snowden has one that has like a switch.  Yeah. Literally shut the wires off. I might need that. Can't get tempted. Yeah.  Like while you're working, the Wi-Fi is off. I mean, you can always go to Wi-Fi and into the. Yeah yeah.  But it seems like go like they have at will to. I think they're going up now. I want to button like a click.  You could just unplug the Wi-Fi. No, no.  It's just too tempting because this I mean you're a writer, you know as much as anybody the the temptation to procrastinate.  Yeah. It's so hard to avoid.  I mean, I, I would I actually want to know how many words I've written on Twitter and I've deleted. I always kind of just delete. I'll have a mood where I'm like, I'm deleting everything and then I'll just delete every tweet.  And so I was thinking like, God, it's it's really a shame how many books I've written on Twitter.  Like, yeah, but also Twitter great American novel is also giving you a very large following.  That's how I mean, I knew you. Yes. Store, but I really got in your shit because of Twitter. Yeah.  No, I think you can tell pretty quickly about someone on Twitter. I think it's the best social media for seeing who someone is because everyone, no one's afraid to be kind of their piece of shit self on Twitter.  You know, it's really the most it's the most honest, I think, of social media because it's primarily a battle of the wit. And, yeah, it's nice to choose to engage.  It's not so much like Instagram, which I can't stand. I don't know how people I, I don't know how anyone does Instagram.  Are you on it. I'm on it, but I never use it. I hate it. I go I hate about it. I just it's so fake. It's so curated.  I know because all the people on Instagram showing me their lives, they call me with all their problems and I'm like, I know what's going on in your life, but it's not like like this. It's so true.  And so I think it's just this is like phony to me. And I go in there and like, I can't.  And all the women are just how does anyone feel OK about themselves on there? I spent five minutes on there.  I was like, I'm ugly. I'm getting just wrinkles. How do I get rid of just wrinkles? I got to go. Let me go.  Let me show you an dripping. Yeah.  This this filter thing. That is so why you posted about your daughter that your daughter's filter made you the pretty lady. How weird is that, you know, that was used in a class at Texas Tech that survived? Yeah, it is terrifying.  Yeah, but that's what girls are dealing with. They look at themselves in the mirror and then they look at like, like the Kourtney or Khloe.  Which one. None of those people are real, but the which which which was the one where she had a totally different head.  Oh maybe. I don't know any of them. Yeah.  Which one. Which one. Chloe. Chloe. OK, you know what she looks like. Yeah. She looks one way and then the picture was like OK, who's this. Yeah. And it wasn't her. I mean they're doing stuff, they're moving their frame around and changing.  Yeah. But they're also doing stuff in real life. But this one was so bad that she photoshopped one side of the chain on her neck off. So she's wearing a change.  But she didn't realize it's a very thin chain that she had accidentally Photoshopped.  One side of the chain was gone, was not in the image.  I look at it. Oh, wow.  But look at the chain like half. Oh, look, on the right hand side, the chain is missing. Oh, it is shedding in her body.  I mean, I guess maybe that is so crazy. I mean, but it's so damaging. There's so much pressure for young girls and her as well. She's got go outside.  I'm not worried about her, but I'm worried about her too. I know. I'm worried about her. She's a human being. She is. Stop. But that's how you get so you get people off your case.  You attack other people. No, I'm not attacking. No, I'm attacking you. What you're doing is problematic.  It's terrible. I mean, she's a person.  She's a human being. You're dehumanizing a Cardassian. It's really bad. You know, it's not cool. I don't feel bad for them.  They're rich and wow. But that's a problem when you say things like that because they suffer from mental.  I know. Well, we all suffer. We do. But it's easier when you're rich.  Yeah, we disagree on. That's the same. I think that could be the same picture.  Well, how do they do the face smile? And I don't know. That doesn't make sense. I don't mean the exact same photo, but it's like the same photo shoot.  Oh, wow, that's crazy.  I don't know what they they have a lot done to their bodies, so I think someone could probably do that at a doctor's office, could make her look like I mean, if I had enough money maybe. Do you think so. Get crazy. We'll see.  When I have money, I'll be like, hey, I'll come in and like completely different. Like, where's where's Bridget and who are you? Hi, I'm Bridget.  I just got rich and now I have tons of work. Yeah, I've reconstructed my entire being.  I remember when Renee Zellweger did. Yeah.  It ruins their life. What do you you can't. We know what you look like. What was the who is the original one. Who did this to Jennifer Gray. Yeah she yeah. She said it ruined her life. She was like known for her nose and then she got the nose job and that kind of ruined her ability to get work.  Yeah. Oh wow. I think she said that I might that make sense that she can't stop working.  Yeah. And she was hot. Yeah. I mean, I mean that it's a nose that's not perfect. Does not make you unsexy. It just doesn't it comes from within.  Mm hmm. Well it's like you're crazy. She had a beautiful body.  She had a great personality. She was pretty.  She just had a non perfect nose. It's funny.  I just what. So do I have a lot of people.  I was talking about this the other day, like someone was asking me how I stay sane and covid and what I'm doing. I'm like I focus on the only two things that matter in life, being hot and rich.  I try to try to get hotter and rich.  Yeah, that's the rub. I get mad on Twitter. I do push ups.  Well, I just you know, the temptation to alter your face like that is I guess if you see what some of the success stories, you know, some of the other Kardashians that have done it and it worked out awesome.  Yeah. There's a lot of pressure. You know, there there's definitely I was not too into any of it. And then I started being on camera more with all these media hits. And I was like, oh, man. I had somebody did a screen cap for one of the interviews I did. I was like, the person doing this hate me. Why would they choose that? I look like I was eating sheet cake for breakfast. Did they catch you?  Like with eyes closed with the mouth?  I was like, how many chins do I have? I did after this. The last time I was on your show, I just kept getting emails. Stop eating bread.  Oh, you're saying that you were so rude.  Yeah, cholerae texting me and e-mailing friends. Friends are saying stop eating bread. Yeah. This is the kind of pressure that Hollywood puts on you.  You just be funny. Yeah, but someone just to be funny. I mean, fat shaming words does work. That's the problem.  It's worked on me. It's worked on me. When I went on that Carnivore diet, one of the reasons I got up to like 205 pounds for me is kind of fat.  I was getting a belly. I was getting these love handles. And we did this weigh in thing for sober October.  And people like, look at your belly. I'm like, fuck, it is kind of sticking out.  And I got there for the that episode at the worst time because I'd eaten. And I eat like a wolf. Yeah. I eat like there's no food coming forever.  Like I'll eat like two steaks, all like a bowl of pasta.  I got to love Texas. I love it out here. Yeah. I could eat barbecue for breakfast. Which places have you gone to. What's the one where Matthew McConaughey this. That's how it's the one where Matthew McConaughey said his favorite famous line in Dazed and Confused.  It's that it's good they use tiebacks.  No, it's bit by bit.  There's so many out here you can't be bad and stay open. Yes. Oh, so good.  It's the place. Oh, good.  For a place that has like two million people living in it. They have like one hundred fifty thousand barbecues. But there he is right there. Yeah.  It's not like that anymore. All right. Yeah. Yeah. That place is amazing. I went to the other one that's really big, the really famous one. It's kind of out franklyn's. No I haven't been there. Yeah I heard. It's amazing. La barbecue.  No it's because my real problem. Yeah.  It's like in our lives just naming barbecue places. Yeah. I found out through Adam Curry that that actually was Germans came here and they had like a smoked meat tradition from Germany and that and they brought that in.  It became Texas barbecue.  Have you been down to green. Green. Yeah, green Texas.  It's not far, but there's like an old it's a dance hall. Kind of common. We went the other night. It was awesome. There's just a guy I have a video I we were you can't dance because everybody has the kind of social distance in there and he was just sitting on stage playing the guitar and I don't know, it's just that it's a tiny little town. But I think it's there is a German founded town. Hmm. Yeah, it's interesting.  Fredricksburg is very German and that's a place that's like got a lot of, like craft places and wineries and.  Yeah, there's tons of history here. I was I was in Georgetown and there was a protest in front of the city hall because of the there's a Confederate statue as a small protest.  How many people? It was mostly white people and do you think they got there because of a Russian troll account? I don't know.  The guy we I spoke to like one of the Confederate like dudes after reporters. Well, he's a descendant of these fighters, and he was trying to explain that they just don't want them to desecrate that. He's like, we won't go down to green and desecrate their soldiers.  And they were union soldiers and we just think, you know, desecrate soldiers. That was like his whole argument for it. And he's like of of the lineage.  And so I was just chatting with him and and he was saying, I'm a descendant of Mao.  And, you know, the way I feel is like, leave Mao alone, you know?  And he was like, you know, you just don't come in, like, does that create the statues and whatnot? But he he said they came every Tuesday and they left it dark.  And it seemed like there were reasonable conversation. It seemed pretty, you know, reasonable. It wasn't like screaming on one side and another. It was like pretty chill.  It is a good question. Right. Like if there's something that's openly racist and represents one of the worst aspects of our country's history, like how do you treat it?  Do you just leave a statue up or should we have like maybe we should have like a graveyard for Confederate statues and you could you could go.  And this one was actually in Huntsville, Alabama.  It was actually in front of the courthouse until last year.  And that crazy boy on a tour I like, instead of taking them down and smashing them, wouldn't it be interesting if there was a place you can go? We could see all of them, but then people would go like, we need to put these back.  We put them back where they belong. Well, I feel kind of like, yeah, we don't need them. You know, I but the problem is there's a process that we usually go through to take them down.  So I would generally air on the side of going through the process. But yeah, but the process doesn't work sometimes.  Yeah, exactly. And sometimes people just feel like they just want to pull them down. This is another thing that's going on right now. This is the perfect storm, the convergence of all these different things that are happening at the same time. And one of them being the covid lockdown's. Yeah, social media, the covid lockdown, the polarization of our country with Trump. And then, you know, this this weird thing where everybody has to pretend that Biden isn't dying like this is all happening together at the same time, like everyone has to pretend he's going to do a great job.  I'm vote for him. We just need to get Trump out of office, like, oh, my God.  Like, can we freeze this freezes and rethink this? Do you guys have anybody else on deck?  Not one. I mean, I guess Harris is on Twitter on Timberland's.  I guess he's one of us.  I seriously love the tweet. Whoever it was, it was like I found the undercover cop like anyone who sees anyone wearing these in a club.  This brand new is the undercover cop, which Charlotte Party Charlamagne on Instagram was like, you know, because it was saying that she's bringing back Timberland's.  And he was like, what the fuck are you talking about?  Like, he's a he's in New York. Like dudes in New York have been wearing Timberland's forever. They've been wearing them since the 80s or whenever they started wearing them, they never stop wearing them like she's bringing back Timberland's. It's like some guy saying, I'll bring it back Choux, you know, bring it back, converse all stars.  Fuck you. You are. They never went away, man.  You can't bring back something that never went away. And Timberland's in New York especially. Never went away. Yeah.  You're not allowed to go back to buy it and you're not allowed to say that you're problematic. Yeah, no problem.  But I've been getting canceled for that.  For I said no. I said in that column, I said something like, he may or may not be slipping into dementia. I mentioned about why I'm not voting.  And then someone from The New York Times said that is it a widely debunked conspiracy theory that he's slipping into dementia? And I said, OK, I said, may or may not. And can you post, like cite your source for where this has been debunked so that my, like, people reading this thread can see it. And this New York Times researcher writer says, well, I've seen him speaking.  And that's just what I gather from like you see, something is widely debunking a situation that's not you.  OK, so you see something and have a different opinion and other people have a different opinion that's not widely like, oh, well, I've seen it and that's it.  Could you imagine let's let's pretend that Kamala Harris was the Democratic nominee and Biden was a Republican.  Could you imagine how savage. Oh, yeah. They would be attacking his mental incompetence. Yeah, no, no.  That's actually a really interesting well, this is an experiment.  Bizarre bias comes into play and this is where everybody's getting lit because they're pretending that everything's OK, because all they want to do is get Trump out of office.  But in doing that, you're exposing this very bizarre tendency that. Will have to comply and to go along with these lines of thinking and behaving and talking, and I can't get into that man because that's cult shit. Yeah, that's religious shit. I mean, that's where these things come from.  They come from everybody not saying what they really feel because there's an agreement that's been made.  Yeah.  You're going to be on the right team, aren't you? You're going to do the right thing. You're going to do the right thing. Yeah.  Or will burn your fuckin house down sometime. We have to stop these fascists or we'll burn your house.  That somebody offered me an interview with someone who I probably could get an interview with him anyway. And he said, if you vote for Biden, I will get you. This guy has an interview.  Come on. We have to save the country. What those those are real message I got like, hey, bro.  Like Jamie's laughing, so, yeah, that's just I understand where you're going with this, like, so crazy.  Yes, fucking insane. It's come on, we have to save the country. Are you sure? What about what about it? Do you want to say what what what part is going to save?  What is what's going to happen?  When I was on, I did one of Brett's unity campfires and. Oh did you. Yeah.  And you know, I was asking I was like, everyone is saying that the other side is the existential threat. And then Brett was kind of like, well, we need to come together because this that is the existential threat.  But everyone. But isn't that I am like, why is everyone on Flight 93, you know, like, scared, of course.  But it's also I guess maybe I have optimistic faith in America. Like, I don't really see how Trump or Biden like.  Well, how can I say I don't know. I don't know.  I hope that either one of them can't destroy America in four years because that means America is already fucked. Yeah, well, we're kind of fucked. I don't like say I know my my 16 year old nephew and all his friends listen and I don't want to give these children no hope for the future.  They have hope for the future.  But we're fucked. Do they? Yeah, we do. Yeah. Yeah. Listen, we're not in the dark ages. No, the Mongols aren't coming over the hills with horses and flaming arrows.  That's what I always say. We're like people are like there's a civil war. I'm like, what, you Americans do that for civil war? Who's who's fighting? What does that even look like?  There will be more armed conflict. Right. That's that's going to happen. Because when you have things like the Kenosha guy who shows up, you know, with an AR and Dossari, take his gun.  Yeah, they'll shoot. Slurping All this stuff is crazy. Yeah. Oh, it's crazy like that. More of that stuff is going to happen if you have more these conflicts and their cattle. Well, the guy in Seattle is not a kid.  Wow. Was Seattle or Portland workshop shot that Portland. Right. It's a Trump supporter. Yeah, it was Portland. I was not a kid. That's just a fucking sociopath. Yeah. Who found a team that he could get with. Yeah. Did you see the interview with him with Vice before they call them.  Yeah. Before they killed the cops. Yet did you ever see a documentary now that show where they made fun of Vice. They parody nice it. That interview with that guy reminded me exactly of the documentary now parody of Vice. It was like, this can't be real.  Well, they interviewed a guy after he killed a guy in the street with a gun and then was justifying it with like, here's my face, here I am.  I definitely did it.  Like admitting that he did it in the way he did. It was in this weird cult like what he was saying.  I wasn't going to let him kill one of my friends of color. That's what he said.  Like, but it was it was so clear that this is a person who's, like, saying the things that he thinks you're supposed to say to signal that you're on this team.  I think they believe it, though. Oh, yeah. I mean, look, if you believe Trump is literally Hitler. All of that behavior makes sense. Yeah, because what lengths would you go to stop Hitler? But it's the same thing in not calling out Joe Biden, right?  Not saying that Joe Biden is is having mental issues is the same thing because it's all what you're doing is you're you're saying things that don't necessarily have to make sense, but they align you with a group. Right, to align you with your compliant. You're fitting in to the words that need to be said that it's a cult.  Yeah, it's on both sides. Right wing and left wing.  Devotions and oh, my God, it's Trump derangement, which is real. And there's Trump Devotion Syndrome, which is the magazine side.  And it is. It's real. Oh, I we made fun of him on dumpster fire just because he said something like completely retarded and deserves to be my all politicians deserve to be mocked. What happened to America.  We used to make fun of all of our politicians. And so I think that in that same episode I had made fun of like Ben in the hall Cardi B thing where he went viral transposes, which was hilarious.  By the way, if you listen to gynecological condition, if you listen to the whole ten minutes is a pretty good bet.  It's pretty funny. And so he went, he's funny. Oh, yeah. He's really he's a smart, funny dude.  He's funny. So he retweeted it and my cousin calls me. She's like, we are.  Our comments on YouTube are like insane people defending Trump. They couldn't get past two minutes of us. The next segment we make fun of Biden and then proceed to make fun of Nancy Pelosi and everything else. But they could not get past two minutes of us making fun of Dear Leader.  Yeah, well, there's there's a there's an issue. I mean, and it works on both ways. There's Trump tweeted a thing recently with me and Matt Taibbi talking about Biden, where I said Biden.  Oh, the flashlight. Wow. That's a great joke. Well, I'm a comedian. I was making a joke, but on the same podcast, we talked about Trump being a sociopath.  We talked we talked about all who just fucking lies like it was not a Trump supporting podcast.  Yeah, but Trump's like a good enough poster, Magga. And everyone's was guy gets bad guys. This is the world we live in.  Yeah. We live in this world with no nuance. Yeah, it's it's very cult. But I wonder how many of those Trump supporters that you get on Twitter are bots, because a lot of them, a lot of them don't know. The devotion is real.  The devotion is really I mean, I'm sure people in real life who are borderline. Q And on and there they cried watching, you know, the RNC for sure. They're the devotion.  And I understand.  Look, I get it, too, because he he rose out of the domination of the mainstream media, the culture, the domination of academia, Hollywood, all all of it.  And he was like a fuck you vote by many people and they feel like he is defending them. And the thing I hear from them over and over again is he will stand up. He'll stand against this tide of insanity coming from the left. He'll stand up for us. And that's why smart people are voting for him.  And that's a silent vote right now.  Yeah, that's that's going to be just like 2016. This is propaganda.  Just who thought everybody felt the way I feel, how this is another thing I keep hearing, which is hilarious.  People who told me that he could never win in 2016 and that it was impossible are telling me again, it's impossible. He can't win.  I'm like. You're telling me the thing that already happened that you thought was impossible is impossible. What kind of logic is this? It doesn't even there's some crazy science.  And when you know the thing about Russian meddling, people talk about Russian meddling. I love it. But here's the real thing about Russian meddling.  The real thing is these trolls, like they do affect people. Yeah, they do. It really does work.  Like if you get enough of these troll accounts that they literally hire to post ProComp things, an anti Biden things and Meems and all these things, like it catches people up in the wave and they want to be a part of that group of people that's piling on against Biden and piling on for Trump.  And a lot of it, like there was one there was a protest is I think it was in Austin. I forget where it was, but it was a protest against white rage. This is a protest. And this dude traced the IP address back to Russia.  He's like, this is great, but they're organizing protests right now.  I know Renee de Resta. She did this whole study of it. And it was it's really fascinating. It is because she found hundreds of thousands of these posts. Oh, yeah. There were all from this Internet research agency in Russia.  I looked they're funny. So I know. I love it when something's trending on Twitter and someone will be like, it's 9:00 a.m. in Russia. You know, the bottom line is something random. You're like, why is this trending? And it's something and divided or selling dissent. And it's like always spelled wrong. And yes, it's just like, oh, Russia's logged in for their workday.  We do it, too. This is what's fucked up about it. It's like we're talking about meddling in our elections. But like, you know what that's like.  That's like someone who's a fucking thief saying someone's been stealing from me. Like stealing some shit you stole. Yeah. What are you talking about. Yeah, we do that with other countries. Yeah. If we're upset that China is fucking with us. You don't think we fuck with China. Come on.  It's it's like the American supremacy kind of mentality where it's like how dare these countries who we've historically meddled in their elections can't meddle in our elections.  Don't you understand? This is outrageous. Where the police of the world. Yeah.  No, it's it's then it's it's a wild you know, I had a funny experience kind of observing how people will engage with these bods. And my nephew, he's probably too young to be on Twitter, has kind of recently got on. He's like they call me like, look, I had a tweet that went pretty big.  And it was like him making some comment about they were coming after Lizzo. And he made this kind of they were coming after Lizzo for some reason. And he made some comment about it that was smart, but it wasn't necessarily like, you know, A to B logic because he's like twelve and people adults were commenting and yelling at him.  And I'm like, oh, this is why I'm never going to argue with someone I don't know on Twitter again, because they might be twelve.  It might be twelve year old, very likely either twelve or what is this report? Arizona teens paid to file social media posts for campaigns. Whoa. Yeah.  This is a Washington Post report of to see yesterday. Um, apparently they're being paid. And then when asked this is the quote from the CEO of the company, Real Kids Operating the real social media profiles and promoting mainstream American values.  While Jake Hoffman, president and CEO of Rally Ford, said in an emailed statement Wednesday that the posts were nothing more than in his, quote, real kids operating real social media profiles and promoting mainstream American values. He said what these young Arizona activists are doing is honest and sincere political activism in the 21st century. In the age of covid-19, whose firm was linked by the post to the Turning Point project, its turning point did not respond to questions.  Neither turning point action nor the affiliated turning point USA responded for Request Turning Point as a conservative youth outreach organization. Its founder, Charlie Kirk, was a featured speaker at the Republican National Convention. Yeah, so it's like a switch.  So they're playing funny how much they're paying to see. Like, if I can get a little political activist kids, imagine if there was a lot of money in it.  If you got like real writers start like people like you start to wonder, like, oh, I could see some serious dissent, sort of everybody on both sides should be happy.  I'm not on either one of these fucking sides and you to be thanking us or not picking a fucking side that would bury the other side.  No, right. I thought of that before. I thought of, like, starting an anonymous account and just saying all the things that I really feel it is going to war with people on Twitter. I've never done it.  I won't do it. I really won't do it.  Because I feel like the problem with that being deceptive, like here's what I'm 100 percent committed to. If I say something, it's because I mean it, yeah, I have to do that. Yeah, that's got me here and we may be wrong this time. I'm wrong all the time. But I'll tell you, I was wrong.  Yeah, but you can trust that the words that come out of my mouth are what I really think.  Well, I think and I could be wrong, but I think we share a somewhat desire to explore honest honesty.  You know, honestly, what I'm feeling. And sometimes I have to push back against myself. Sometimes I say things so that I can get pushed back and here see the blind spots. I'm not going to know what my own blind spots are unless I put my opinion out there and hear back from people. Not all of it is great.  Some of it's really reasonable criticism that I yeah, I can take in from people I respect, you know, and not not even people who maybe I am completely if if someone is not even my friend, but they they critique something in a respectful way out here that, you know, I don't I feel like it's necessary to just I try really hard, to be honest.  I can't it's not lucrative for me, to be honest.  No. I think, you know, money and nuance can if it's true. No, I mean, ultimately.  Yeah, yeah. Ultimately there is there's there's a future in that ultimately. But we're this is one of the reasons why I'm so steadfast today is because we're in the most polarized, the most ideologically based time ever in terms of like you have a side, you stick with it, you battle against the other side. And I see this from smart people and it drives me crazy. Yeah, it drives me crazy because I'm like, I know you're smart because I know you're educated.  I know you know a lot of facts, but you are so fucking stupid about human nature.  Yeah. To behave like this because you're denying the very thing that literally made us racist. The very thing that's made us go to war. Tribalism.  Yeah, this is what it is. All of it stems from people who look like me or people who think like me or people from the patch of dirt that I'm from. Those are on my team. Yeah. We got to stick together and we got to all agree. Yeah. That that's nonsense. That's nonsense. And we know it's nonsense. We know that in 2020 that we don't have to think like that. It's not smart. Yeah.  I mean I think that our founders really understood human nature and they had this insight which I still don't know how they managed to have it. It's a miracle. Amazing. I mean, Jonah Goldberg wrote this amazing book, Suicide of the West, and he talks about all of this, essentially how the Enlightenment and we just stumbled on this miracle. And in the end, he has the appendix.  I'm like, if anyone in America should read anything, it should just be the appendix of his book, which is all the stats of how much humanity has been lifted out of the dirt, you know, and we've lifted up even in developing world like everybody's do.  Yeah, there's problems, obviously, but everybody overall, it's never been more convenient and easier for humans to just exist.  And I sometimes feel like, is this just humans? Because they're not fighting and trying to, like, survive their self destructing and having to create that reality for themselves is is life just too easy?  There's a lot of that. There's a lot of the existential risk. The real risk of of humanity up until now has been war, murder, death, death.  It's so hard to live so hard. And that was what people concentrated on. But now, because of I mean, who is just discussing this with me the other day, was it Douglas Murray?  Maybe or was it? I don't forget who it was so many years anyway, so many guests. Yeah, but this is this is part of the problem with social media is like the problems that you have today are big to you because you do not have big problem. Right. When you have big problems, if you have someone in your family that you love.  Yeah. That's that's dying or sick. Someone calling you a fuckhead on Twitter doesn't mean anything to you. Yeah, but when you don't have that and then you're like, hey, fuck you. You know, like then that that Twitter comment is the thing that gets you. Yeah. And that gets you out of bed. And you check the comments and see what else did they say. Oh, and I said this. Let's see. I got them now.  Yeah. You know, and this is your conflict.  This is you with a catapult. It's boxing now.  It's crazy because it's like I know women on the east side in New York who are online all day battling and they're like, I'm so tired. This is so exhausting. I'm in so much distress. I mean, it's mental illness.  It's in there. And I'm like, you're doing this to yourself. You are all doing this to yourself. It's not a lot of the conflict. And I were saying this on Twitter the other day. I'm like, I'll be worried about America when no one can tweet.  Like you're all tweeting and you're online bitching about something or other when you have like you said, when you have somebody, for instance, a cancer diagnosis. Someone in my life recently would thought they were diagnosed with cancer. They weren't for that 24 hours. You realize that is your life now?  Well, that's how I felt at the beginning of covid, the beginning of the lockdown. I really thought it was going to be like September 11, like when September 11th came around, everybody joined up. We all got together because we all realize, like, all this petty bullshit is important. What's really important is we got a fucking band together because we're going to run out of toilet paper and food because there's a disease coming. It's going to kill everybody.  And then when that didn't happen, it's like you have ramped up the other way.  Everybody just got crazier. And it just goes to show you all areas. It is the viewers talking about toilet paper.  You're like, oh, Green had a great point, though. Tom Green's point was when you go to the supermarket, toilet paper is a light item, but it takes up a lot of space. Yeah. And you only have so much shelf space.  And he goes, there's just people seeing other people stockpiling. Yeah. When they take it. And then it's missing, dude. But it's kind of funny.  Like, that's not the first thing I would think of that I've I've also worked in farms and like shit in the woods so.  Oh yeah. So you can you know, that's not my first thought. And the apocalypse, like that's what I need to to stockpile, which is like water.  Yeah, exactly. It shows you how disconnected we are with real threat, like, oh, what am I going to do. I'm not going to be able to wipe my ass from all this food that I'm binge eating while locked down. And that's like saying like that's not a real crisis, guys.  And drinking constantly. Everybody's drinking went up like some.  Oh yeah. And I was like twenty percent more. While the bars were closed, alcohol consumption rose like twenty percent.  I am on. I had to it was hard for me because I'm sober and I'm on threads with my very Irish Catholic family. And for the first couple of weeks there are just pictures of their their stockpiles, which I 100 percent would have done if I was back my drinking days before even water.  It would have been it would have been booze. Yeah. I mean, my family I always tell this joker like it's something that's just funny in our family. It was like police. It was a police, vicars, liquors and then fire and the emergency contact.  That's real. My grandmother had that and are growing up and we're like, well, it's real. Fires don't really start till after we drink. You're like, oh my God, it's so funny.  Yeah, I was it was a I think it's just interesting to see when I remember when it first started. I was I was kind of eerie, like no one was out in L.A., that was it was rainy in those first days. I went down to the beach. There was no one on the beach. There's no one even driving. And I walked by this guy. He was kicked back in a sofa he had his television on and he had a beer.  He was on his phone just with a nice little throw. And I was like, this is apocalypse light, you know?  And I really like I've never seen a more perfect picture of what the modern apocalypse looks like.  It's not fighting for.  I just remember remember Katrina when it got really bad down there and people were fighting for food and it got it got savage really, really quickly in those. And I think it was in like the Superdome.  Mm hmm. Yeah. Have you ever read the book blindness?  No, I couldn't read fiction for two years after I read that book.  And it's all about a pandemic of blindness, said people. And they all get put in quarantine. They get quarantined together. The people who are getting this blindness and then the wife of the guy who gets here is like stricken with blindness. She fakes it so she can be with her husband and she's witness to all of the shit that goes down once all these people are out of society and in this quarantine. And it's like rapes and murders and stuff.  And just how quickly it kind of the veneer of society deteriorates. Who wrote it?  Oh, God, he won a Pulitzer for it. I'm going to blank on it.  Thank you. He's a great writer. It's amazing. Yeah, so I think that we're, you know, it's pretty under the circumstances.  The other thing that I've been kind of surprised about is, like you were saying, there's going to be more armed conflict. I was like, I'm pretty amazed at how restrained people are.  Very much like 300 million guns, maybe probably 400 million now. And more than people. Guns and people. Yeah, and just a few shooting.  Pretty restrained. Yeah, pretty restrained. Good job. America, especially considering the videos of cops shooting black people, especially when you think about how crazy it could have gotten. There's been some horrific incidents.  Yeah, this is a really bad one. I think it was in Baltimore, this white guy walking on the street and for no reason, this black kid runs up behind him and hits him in the head with a brick.  Yeah, the guy's face plants and the people that are filming it are in a car and they're laughing. Yeah, well, the brick hits the guy in the guy's face, plants on the concrete. So much violence, but for no reason, right?  Yeah, it's crazy, but so little of that comparatively. Yeah. To what it could be. Yeah. You know, there's a lot of people that thought a real race war was going to happen in this country.  But I think most people, the vast majority of people are not racist. The vast majority, the vast majority of cops, I think are not racist. I think the vast majority of people are not violent or evil, the vast majority. That's why you can just go places. Yeah. That's why it's not a fucking shooting gallery everywhere you go.  Yeah. The vast majority of people are not violent or evil. You know, it's just we have human beings living together in a very imperfect scenario.  Yeah. You know, we we were talking about this the other day. You don't hear about the planes, the land. You just there are so many people doing so many good things that you don't hear about them.  And so you're only hearing even in in police shootings, it's like we focus in a lot of this.  I blame on the media is like it would be like only focusing on planes that crash, but it's not even the media anymore.  A lot of these things are just online videos that go viral.  Yeah, yeah. But I think the so much of the the division and that like picking narratives there are there driving narratives. And I and people are obviously kind of partaking in this.  But I, I still think that it's we when I first, like you said, about the early days of the pandemic, I thought the same thing because you would go out and there was you have this kind of like you'd like, you have your mask on or whatever you walk. And people were out walking because they can go to the gym or anything. And there would be that kind of look at each other with that solidarity. There's that feeling of like, yeah, we're in this.  Yeah. And it was only two weeks later before people are crossing the street angrily. I got mass shamed by a guy.  We were walking and I had my bandana just around my neck and he was very far away and he was like, no mask, no mask is screaming at us and I'm a bright red.  You're a bad person. You don't have a mask on. But he's I'm like, dude, you're going to have a heart attack before covid ever kills you. Just yelling at people who don't have mass. And he's like, I would have to spit in his mouth for him to get covered from me. He's not going to get it from me from a block and a half away, just yelling.  And this is where I think people are driving themselves insane.  Well, the unhinged have never had a better time. This is this is their time because they have so much company. You know, if you're an unhinged person like you're on team unhinged, like you're like, oh, look at all the people on my side.  Why are you the one who had that tweet that was like, we have a mental health problem, that we have a gun, something about guns and mental health?  Yeah, I have a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem and a tyranny problem disguised as a security problem.  Yeah, that's a great tweet. I think about that all the time because, man, is that played out now because now we're just seeing the mental health and the tyranny.  Yeah, well, we we legitimately have a gigantic mental health problem in this country. Look, I am a person who I've I've done a lot of things. I've a family. I'm happy. I have good friends, I'm successful and I have mental health problems. Yeah, I have mental health problems. Yeah. And my mental health problems are very minor. I just want to be real clear. They're very minor, but I get weirded out sometimes.  We all do. We all we all get in funk. Sometimes we all have issues. We all have issues. Yeah.  When something challenges us and we don't have character and we don't have a history of overcoming issues and we don't have tools in terms of like whether it's exercise or meditation or yoga or whatever you do to alleviate tension. And then you have the fucking gasoline, which is social media. Yeah. And you're throwing gasoline on your fire instead of figuring out a way to put out the coals, you're just going to have madness. And there's so many people that are unhealthy right now.  And then they've been alone and isolated and. It just shows how much you need that social interaction, because people I feel like are losing their manners. You know, I've heard from many people and my my sister texted me, she said I just saw a real life Facebook fight at dinner. And it was like and someone else texted me and he said, I just saw a real life Twitter interaction in the grocery store. So this behavior that generally is relegated to the way we are when we're anonymous are not anonymous online with each other that you would never necessarily be if you were face to face because everybody's been online.  It's like they're starting to behave that way in real life. That's not good.  Well, that's what everybody's afraid of, was afraid of when it comes to, like video games. Yeah, people are afraid that, like, violent video games are forcing people or were going to cause people to be violent in real life. I don't think that's real.  I think they've done studies that that's not real. They're never proven that. I think there's actually violence that it's gone down.  Yes, it's the opposite.  But I think that there's something about the way human beings are just interacting with other human beings. Those video games, you're not shooting a real person. You're shooting of an avatar. You know, you shoot the thing and it's fun. The thing about interaction with people is you're really hurting someone's feelings. Yeah. And then you get used to doing that and then you don't you're not around people a lot. Yeah. Most of your interactions are just this way.  And then when you are around people, you behave in the same way that you would if people were in front of you.  Yeah. I mean, I think about how much like how many mental health tools I need. I don't I'm I like you. I have mental health problems. I've had anxiety in my past. I had debilitating hypochondria that I overcame.  How did you overcome it? Man, I should really write a book about I should write Kill Your Hypochondria before I Kills You, because it was debilitating for the title.  It was debilitating and it was I hope people don't get past that. Oh, my therapist was like you. How did you do this? But it was basically I took OK, so it was kind of a three pronged attack because I'm like, I can't live like this because hypochondria truly makes you feel insane.  And, you know, you can objectively know I'm crazy, but your mind gets stuck. It's like OCD. And so it's it's kind of based in OCD because you get stuck in a loop. Like, I would just get stuck in a loop, for instance, like there's something wrong with my lip. There's something wrong with my lip. There's something wrong with my lip. There's something rotten. I don't know. I just get stuck in that loop or I have thyroid cancer.  I have thyroid cancer. I have you know, I would just be, like, stuck in this crazy loop. It's it's insane. Did it come slowly or did it it got worse.  You know it have it. No, I think I come from like a long line of hypochondriacs, though, now, because, like my mom used to have, you know, do you remember those books before the Internet where it was like, if you have this, it was like a choose your own adventure. But it was like if you have this symptom before the Internet there, these books are could be like if you have these this symptom, go to page two hundred and thirty three.  And if you have this and I remember my mom would use those quite a lot, so I think she has some of it.  My dad is just a big worry wart. So I have that kind of neurotic energy I believe.  But I think too I was smoking a lot of weed and I mostly got it when I was hungover, like that's when it would be the worst as I would be hungover.  So anyway, I had to as you realizing what you did to your body, I think I just had I had to attack it from from three different places.  So the first is the actual I was like, all right, I'm going to rewire my fucking brain. And I set myself out to do this. And I put a rubber band on and I did that stupid thing. But it totally worked where if I was like, there's something wrong with my lap and I'd snap my rubber band and I'd be like, I'm healthy. I am, I would just replace it with I am healthy enough to come up with what I do.  I read somewhere that it's a good way to help with, like, repetitive thoughts or to just help yourself. I mean, I was training my dog at the same time too, and I was like, yeah, this is kind of like dog training.  I just have to interrupt that, you know, like that that firing. And there's that whole idea of what fires together, why it's not even an idea. It's like a fire together, wire together. So every time the other thing I had to do is explain that what fires together, wires together.  So it's this concept of whatever you're kind of thinking and acting on it, it just creates like a pathway, a neural pathway in your brain that gets stronger and stronger.  If they're if it's like that, like, for instance. If so, this is why part two was replacing the thought. But I also couldn't act on it. So I couldn't go look in the mirror. I couldn't go Google anything if I thought I had cancer, I had to cut myself off from acting on because a lot of people have hypochondria. They'll obsessively Google. They'll go get tested for everything. They'll. Spent thousands of dollars getting tests.  Luckily, I was not on I didn't have insurance, I was too poor to really, like, lean fully into my hypochondria that way. And I just had to stop myself from the action because that, you know, any time you have a thought in, you act on it. It reinforces that connection that like mind body connection, and it would reinforce that pattern of worrying. And then I had to start observing. I kept this is very I guess to it's very like CBT.  So cognitive behavioral therapy, I didn't know this is kind of what I was doing, but I would keep now they have very it's like you keep a record of what they call a thought log. And I would just document when I had the thought, what brought it up, like what triggered that back? Because there's always kind of a trigger and then what action I took and what action I could take to replace it. And so I sometimes it's just not acting out at all.  And then I started working with therapists on all the things that were underpinning those the the triggering thoughts. So one was like, I couldn't hold joy. I just any time I felt like I was excited about doing anything, I was going to Hawaii. That was when I was like perseverating on my lips. And I couldn't it was like I could not enjoy anything without my brain telling me that everything was going to shit and I was going to die. So I had to look at that.  Where does that come from? Feelings of worthlessness, upbringing or whatever? Yeah. Then the other one was shame around sexuality.  Like there was just some a lot of shame around. Like I was pretty promiscuous when I was drinking a lot and I didn't I was always proud of the men I woke up with. And it happens to the party girls. And, you know, I was an intern. I was an international slut.  And there were some there are some like I'm Catholic, too, raised Catholic so that she had squirted in before I had a chance in hell. And so there's lots of shame around that that I had to really look at and deal with.  And and yeah. So I just started looking at all this stuff and I like it took me. It was work. It was frickin work.  And now I'm like completely free of it. I don't. Yeah. That's amazing. You did that. Congratulations.  I mean, I, I definitely I feel like I can live and breathe and I can just be present. Meditation was big and then I think a lot of people forget that, you know, drinking and substances are not a coping mechanism.  They can be if you if you are not using them addictively. But for many people, like drinking is they'll be like, I have a coping tool. It's drinking.  I'm like, that's that I kopitar exacerbates it, like it or not. So I had to quit that. And I was joking, just like how many fucking things I need to do to start my days. I'm like I wake up, I meditate, I have to like, you know, I have to work out. I'm a crazy person, I've got to sweat. I just know what I have to do.  Yeah. And people it's important I think instead of and people ask me all the time how I deal with the online hate and all, I'm like I just go work out.  That's my answer to everything. Yeah. That's an answer though because it requires effort and it requires like as much as it's difficult when you're sitting down in front of a computer to overcome procrastination and. Right.  Multiply that times ten and it's getting to the gym because the physical discomfort of like, oh, you like your mind.  Well, your frame of mind. Fuck you.  Yeah. That's why I have these this I have like mugs and T-shirts that say conquer your inner bitch.  I love that.  That's what it is. There's there's a thing it's in me. I was talking to David Goggins, who's one of the most savage people that's on the planet today.  And he and I had a long, hilarious conversation on the phone yesterday about it. And I said one things that are really appreciate about you as you talk about your struggles, like there's a video that I put up on my Instagram the other day. I just wrote Stay and it's his video and it's him talking about this struggle that he has. David Gorgons, one of the hardest men alive. He has a struggle. Sometimes when he gets up and just starts feeling sorry for himself, he starts feeling like it just like, fuck, I'm tired and I want to do this.  Yeah.  And then he actually says he said those thoughts into a tape recorder or, you know, phone or whatever the fuck it is and then listen to it playback.  And he's like, I sound like a straight bitch.  Yeah, that's hilarious. But he realized it. Yeah. And then he got fired up and went out and did it. But what I said to him is, what's so important about him and why he's so important to people is because he shows you the weakness.  He shows you that he has these thoughts himself, but he just always wins. Yeah, he overcomes those, but he knows that those demons are there. They're there for everybody. But he's just got a long history of overcoming those demons. And so he knows that he just has to go to work.  It's the warrior ethos. You know, it's something I've really always tried to develop in myself and I respect and other people. And I think that you don't have to be like.  Literal warrior to develop that ethos, and it's something that used to be so respected and Sparta and there are just so many, there's that was something that was revered. And I feel like in our society now, because victimhood has become currency like no warrior in the fucking world would ever want to be considered a victim. They will die on their own sword. Yeah.  And it's important that I think people like David and you and I just to to really embrace that spirit and try and promote it, because ultimately it feels better to work against your worst instincts.  It does.  It just it might be harder, but it feels at the end it feels so good. You don't have to do a lot.  This is the other thing that I love about. There's this great book, Tiny Habits, and it's all about bundling habits and how you don't have to start every day and say, I'm going to start working out every day an hour, know you're probably going to fail. Just start doing 10 minutes and then you might do more. Yeah. And then bundle it with one minute of meditation and just start little increments and just be consistent.  You know, that's great advice because it really is about building healthy habits. Not so much. It's it's just my friend said to me, it's more, more habits, less goals, because we're so goal oriented and goals are good to work towards.  But you're not going to get there without healthy, consistent habits.  And people are just disciplined. It's fucking hard. It is fucking hard. It's hard to be disciplined.  It is hard. And the victim mentality, one of the reasons why I reject it so heavily is because it's completely contrary to comedy. Yeah. Like if everyone is a victim and you can't, like, have any victims ever, well, then you can't have any jokes now because you're making fun of things that are preposterous. And as soon as you can't make fun of things that are preposterous, like like I was talking we were talking before about this Vyse thing that was written about transphobia episodes of this podcast.  And one of the things that they wrote was that I incorrectly described how Caitlyn Jenner transitioned or why Caitlyn Jenner transitioned.  And I'm like, oh, you mean Kris Jenner isn't really a demon that hovers over his bed and whispers in his ear and converted him to a woman like, what the fuck are you talking about?  So this this kind of nonsense is like a.. Caitlyn Jenner got mad at me. I was only just recounting an old joke from 2016. Yeah. I got no hate for that person. No, no. I'm sorry if I said the wrong name.  I don't even know hate yet.  We are making big deals out of things that aren't big deals. And we're making we're turning jokes into literal statements that are that is hate speech. Yeah, that is nonsense. And, you know, it's nonsense. Yeah. And, you know, it's nonsense.  We had to I mean, we were having there is we were driving yesterday and there's a Planned Parenthood above a Mexican place that we drove by.  And I was like, okay, imagine you're like going in and they're like, you're killing babies. And it's like, I just wanted to get a margarita, you know?  And we were making all these jokes and I was like, God, it feels so good to just be like joke freely because I feel like the world has become just a floor of eggshells and everyone's like walking on eggshells all the time.  Can I say this? Can I say this?  Because everyone's many people are dealing with mental illness. And that's what it's like when you're dealing with mentally ill people. You're constantly walking on eggshells.  But it's I always say to comedians, I'm like, don't die on your don't die on the content of the joke. Die on the right to be hyperbolic. Yes. Because that's what they're coming after. Exactly. They'll come after them. I don't fight about the content of the joke.  Just fight for your right to be a hyperbolic comedian, because that's if we have that we have nothing.  We have to be ridiculous. We're fucking clowns.  Well, look at Joey Diaz. Yeah, he's the best example and in my opinion, the funniest guy I've ever seen. Everything is is everything he says is so over the top. But that's part of why you laugh. Yeah.  You know, he's not being honest. He's he's making you laugh. He's doing comedy. And he's doing it by grossly, ridiculously exaggerating something so crazy.  Yeah. That's why I get mad when comedians are like you who are shitting on other comedians.  When I see other comedians going after other comedians for their jokes, I'm like, what the fuck is happening here?  Well, they're always bad. Here's the thing that's this is the fact the comedians that go after comedians for jokes, they're always mediocre. Yeah. This is I don't know. I'm not trying to be mean. No, and I'm not always is a generalizations. The two of the comic.  It's not always some of them are good comics to do it erroneously. But the thing that they're doing, they're doing because there's a feeling inside you that always feels bad that you don't reach the.  High marks, there's like a thing where you don't quite and then you see someone step out of line or see someone take maybe misstep, maybe, maybe they fuck up, maybe they make a joke and it doesn't work.  And you want to attack them. You want to tell. But Patrice O'Neal said it best. And he said when someone tells a joke that kills or someone says a joke that offends people and doesn't work, it all comes in the same place. Yeah. And that places you're trying to be funny. Yeah. That's what you trying to do. You're not trying to be mean, you know. And I remember particularly the early days of my my standup comedy when I was terrible.  I would just say anything to get a laugh, anything. And I didn't have to believe it at all. Yeah.  I literally didn't have to mean it. Yeah. If I knew it would work and I treated I treated comedy jokes like hammers. Yeah. There was like a hammer. I'm just looking for a nail because that work was that work.  I was lost in the woods, I was had a blindfold and I was feeling for trees.  Yeah. Everybody though that's what I did. Yeah.  And then after a while I realized, OK, well some of these I have to think they're funny and then then it works better.  And then, then I just had, I had to figure out who I was. Right. But I got into comedy with very little real social life when I was twenty one. When I got into comedy I'd only been fighting like I didn't have a normal childhood like my child from fifteen to twenty one was all kicking people in the face and getting kicked like that was my whole life.  So my whole sense of like what the world was was all fucked up. So I had to develop opinions on things. I had zero opinions on politics or weddings or. And so all I talked about for like the first year of comedy was sex. Yeah, that was my whole comment.  But that's all I had, that that's pretty common, especially when you're twenty one what what other life experience you have.  And by the way, thank God that's what you did, because do you ever wonder where you would be if you were that age now. Oh my God. You'd be out in the streets.  I would have a real problem.  You had a.. But I don't know what I would do.  But the point is like. When I would tell a joke outside of sex, I really didn't know what was funny. Yeah, I didn't I knew I was like certain things were funny with sex. And so I had those jokes. But if I tell a joke about something else, I was just swinging at the wind.  I love the process of finding what's funny, though, even though it's uncomfortable and awkward. I was doing I was trying to get this bit where I was talking about how my dad sat me down to have an awkward conversation about my freezing my eggs.  And I was like, too old. I was like 37. I was like, Dad, isn't this like asking me if I want to freeze the chicken like seven days after it's been in the fridge? You know, you're you're probably not going to freeze that chicken. It just seems like, too, it's like past its prime already.  I feel like maybe you should have had this conversation with me when I was like 30, not thirty seven. It just seems so.  And he's like, I didn't realize you had a whole chicken metaphor. I was like, oh.  And so I was trying to do this and all I kept getting was like oh from the audience.  And I hate the pity. I'm like I'm over here talking. It's fine. I to feel bad for me, but that's my job as a comedian, to be like, OK, why is everyone feeling sorry for me?  There's a lot of gals out there freezing eggs and I just want to put my hands on their shoulder and go keep those fucking eggs frozen.  Keep just keep the eggs frozen.  Do you know that ninety nine percent of eggs don't get used? I'm sure it's something crazy.  It's a crazy high percentage of eggs that don't get used.  It's you don't have to have to.  It's expensive. Yeah. Kids are expensive, but freezing your eggs is fucking expensive and you have to storm, you got to pay a freaking storage fee.  Listen, having kids is awesome. Don't get me wrong. Yeah. But you don't have to have kids. Yeah. This idea that the path that everybody takes is the path you have to have, there's, there's something about it that used to infuriate me when I, when I was younger, where people would tell people what children would tell you. You have to have a child. Yeah.  And I feel like a prisoner telling me that I need to commit a crime. You know, I get come come with us.  You don't have to now. You don't have to. I don't look, I don't I don't have, like, a steadfast rule for anything involving human beings in their path in life as long as they're doing no harm.  Yeah, I think as soon as someone does, I always feel like they're trying to justify their own path by like how many people who do certain things want you to do those things.  Yeah, well, I appreciate the honest parents like my sister who's like don't have kids. And she's kidding.  But she and it's it's another one of those things that in my instance, it never it was less about having a kid and more about having a family. And I had never at that point met a man that I wanted to really have a family with. And that was important to me.  I know it's crazy wanting a man in my life and going to get canceled for that one.  And so it just it had and, you know, I'm very and then I was I hit forty and I was like, oh, shit, am I going to regret this?  Is it something that, you know, I'm more worried about looking back and being like I should have, but I just.  You can always adopt. I can always adopt. There's so many kids who need good parents. And I feel so I am truly like that woo kind of hippie chick who is like, I'm right where I should be.  Yeah, I have to believe. I have to believe.  But you are you are right where you should be. Dollman right. Considering especially your past. You are right where you should be.  Yeah. And considering I mean even just this whole trip to Texas has been so informative because I, I went to go, I went through the process of looking at houses just to see found out all this stuff.  But really I was like, oh I, I can buy a house. That's that was an amazing moment for me because I went bankrupt when I was twenty six and I have worked really hard to, I had to like repair my credit.  I had to get a little baby three hundred dollars a month car that I paid off in full. And you know, I had to focus on that and I feel it was a nice moment to be like, OK, all right, I can see the path forward. And and so many times in my life when I thought I wanted something like I really wanted to write for maximum when I was twenty three, I recently found the proposal.  It's hilarious, but I was like, yeah I want to, I was, I was such a I was such a boy like a boys girl, you know, I just, I moved a lot and the guys were always nice to me and they always let me in their club. So I was at poker nights and bachelorette parties and all that shit where women generally weren't allowed. And I had access to just the male brain and they were they felt comfortable being their disgusting selves around me.  And I didn't judge them for it and and that. So I was like, I need to write for Maxim. I get these dudes, I want to write sex advice. And I never really got that column.  I never had I didn't know anybody to even I was living in a small town. I was talking to Colin about this. I was like I was so delusional. I was waiting tables and I was like. A town drunk telling people when I was serving them French fries, like remember my name? Did you really have a fucking huge anger you don't like? Can you get recalls? Large set of fries, young lady, are you talking about. I am pretty sure I saw you being in the alley the other night.  That's why you got to forgive people when they're young. Yeah. And when you see someone acting really ridiculous when they're young, don't don't write them off forever.  Yeah.  I mean, it's kind of like a bounce back the story, I think of the long fucking road that is banned even. And so I didn't get that. But then I ended up writing for Playboy, which was even better.  It was on the Internet, you know, and I wanted to write for Maxim. We only had magazines and it was much bigger than I could have imagined, but some in the same space. And so now you know that there might be another better thing. Yeah, like rejection.  I love that phrase. Rejection is God's protection. I love that. And my therapist always says protection. Yeah.  It's like you being rejected by a man or a woman or somebody or a life opportunity. It's just because there's something better or you're a jerk.  You know, I've always felt like it just means whatever it is, whether you're rejected for a job or rejected, either you're not good enough or the system's fucked.  Oh, see, I mean, maybe one of those things is, well, there's a lot of people that get jobs that do not deserve them and people that do deserve those jobs don't get them. Yeah, that cronyism, nepotism.  There's a lot of thuggery that goes on with it, but that's OK, too. But a lot of times it's a wake up call.  There's a lot of people like when you were telling people, remember my name, there's a lot of people that really believe there's something that they're not. And the only way to find out that you are not that person is to be defeated. And that's one of the reasons why I think martial arts is so important for men, because men have it in their head, this ridiculous idea that there's something that they're not. And the best way to find out that you are something that you're not is to get squashed.  Oh, yeah. So you get squashed a lot.  I, I've eaten a lot of humble pie.  Well, anyone who gets good at you jitsu has been fucking manhandled for a long time and to get to reach a black belt in jujitsu or even a purple belt, which is what Andrew Yang thinks every police officer should be. And I think so too. Yeah, that's. Yeah.  You get your fuckin ass handed to you for years. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean I can think I can close my eyes.  Just think all the times like strangled tap, tap, tap, tap on my leg tap.  It's just like you just get you lose all the time. Most men don't have enough opportunities in life to lose.  Losing is very important. It is important. Failing and losing are so huge, they're so certain. And we live in a culture that doesn't really, you know, it's obviously very success driven.  And everybody and you see the you know, that ten years to become an overnight success or whatever, I'm like I ate so much.  I was telling this story today with Colin just about how I was so delusional. And I had I went bankrupt. I started fantasy dotcom when I was four because it was greeting cards and T-shirts.  And I had this great idea. And then I had no business acumen and I drove around America. Highest gas prices ever in America, I think to this day for six months.  And I was like selling T-shirts on the beach telling people like, I remember that they're like, it's spring break. I'm not going to remember anything yet.  Yeah, I was just delusional.  And I just I came out here and then my cousin, who's my partner on a lot of stuff, I'm like, you know what?  We can turn this company around, like on the verge of bankruptcy. I'm like, we're going to go to Costco, we're going to get some white boards. And we had six hundred dollars are the stuff and two cards. I was maxed out on my credit cards. I go to pay with my credit card and they're like, we don't take credit cards because it's Costco. They only take like that one guy in American Express. I think it's changed our visa or something.  So they only took one and they wouldn't take it.  And then we just had to, like, abandon these two cards.  Like, why do they think that, like, dry erase boards? There's the thing that I needed in that moment, spending six hundred dollars.  And I do tell young people who come to me for advice, I'm like, you know, there is you have to kind of be a little delusional to be in a creative path in particular because the difference between delusions and dreams is hard work.  Like you're delusional if you're sitting in your mom's basement, you're like, I'm going to do this and you're never doing anything.  But you do need a little bit of overachieving delusion to kind of push yourself.  You could call it that. I would just call it ambition. Yeah. And a trust in the process.  Yeah. Yeah. Terrible if you're a comedian and you're terrible, right, and but you think I know a lot of terrible comedians who have been hugely successful so as to be sure I made a tribute to those joke thieves.  But a lot of them, they they start out bad, but they have these moments where they get laughs. If you could figure out what happened there and then and then take those embers and blow on them and and use it and figure out how to recreate that and then figure out how to get better at it.  It can be done, but you also have to be ruthlessly introspective.  And that is a thing that most people are not willing to do. Most people want to protect themselves from their failures and they want to pretend that it was other people's fault or people were plotting against them or, you know, how come it always happens to them or you gets all the breaks and all these that all that shit does you zero good and just pushes people away from you. It creates exact opposite, the exact opposite amount of the exact opposite kind of energy that you need to be successful.  Yeah, well, you need to be successful is pain.  Yeah.  You need all my best growth moments in comedy came after I bombed like embarrassing, horrific bombings.  Those are when I got my shit together and I got better and I go, my God, I can't do that again. And then I got better.  There's just been a series. There's like been there's this big ones in my life where I was like that, like it was the worst feelings I've ever had.  Yeah, it's not. I've had losses and fights that feel losses feel bad.  I get PTSD, just talking about bombings from bombings, worse things getting your ass kicked.  So I'm trying to say, oh, bombing feels worse than getting your ass kicked. It really does.  I had one of the comedy store that I still remember like it was yesterday. It was it was a monumental a guy that I was kind of having an affair with, actually. He was there with his friends, which is even worse. I would have rather it had been a thousand strangers. And they kept pushing me and it was and they kept pushing me and pushing me cause I'm nobody. And I just kept drinking and drinking and drinking.  And I got on stage and I was like, I'm cold and afraid.  And that was it. And then I blanked. I couldn't remember anything. They muse it was her think it was horrific.  You know, you feel me.  It was 100 percent. I can't watch open mike nights.  I can't like one of one of the reasons why I take great comedians on the road with me.  I always take funny people because there's nothing weirder to me than watching someone who's not funny and then thinking I can go be funny.  Yeah, yeah. I don't I feel like nothing's funny. Like if I see someone eat shit I'm like, oh my God, comedy doesn't work. Like there's no comedy, it's not real.  It's just can't be done. It can't be done. This person is bombing. Nothing is funny. Nothing they're saying makes me think, oh yeah I know it's funny.  And then if you go on after someone who bombs is terrible, you have to kind of reintroduce the idea of things being funny. Yeah. It gets a lot more work.  You got this have this actually happen to me in a situation that I had no business being in, which is often the case was stand up.  And it was they had made some deal where Bill Burr was performing, who's a God?  And then there was just a bunch of nobodies who that they had arranged that would like kind of just open for him basically, so that he could like do is our that he was testing because he doesn't give a fuck. They're not here to see any of us. They're just here to see him.  And the girl I was the girl in between, a girl who bombed and Bill and I was like, this is so much pressure.  Thank God I didn't. And that and since have bomb. But it was you like the audience is traumatized.  Right. Right.  They need to recover. They need to you need to bring them back and let them know everything's OK.  And there's also something where you know that someone who's going on after you is just way better than you. And you just start judging your act and judging all of your material.  Oh, God. Second guessing your taglines and.  Yeah, yeah. That was like who was it? Jeff Garland. I was opening for him and I was just so paranoid. I got him.  I had the first show is a disaster and he's like, No one gives a fuck Bridgid. They're here to see me. And I'm like, you can go. He's like, I, I demand you go out there and bomb. And he's like, you need to try all new stuff. He was great. You pushed me.  He's like, I don't care. Go out and be like there. I'm going to come out because you know him. He just has like the awkward silences that he loves.  Yeah, he is.  And he's like now most people in this moment would be uncomfortable.  It's just silent now. Like, sit down.  Just take a lot of and yeah, I've learned a lot. I mean, I learned I definitely have learned more from bombing than I have from. Yeah.  That's where you learn.  Well you definitely learn from killing too. I mean. Well that just feels like feels awesome. But it also does teach you what's good in your act and the pacing and.  Correct, pacing and like how you're presenting bits, and I never leave a bit alone until I'm ready to film it, I'm always fucking moving things around and trying to find a better way to and, you know, you find out through whether or not it works.  What's your process for writing? Well, there's a bunch of different ways. Sometimes I just have an idea and I just write it down on my phone. Like sometimes I'll be talking to my wife and I've got an idea. And she she understands. I've run away. I've run away, like, literally run and I just write it down because like it's like there's slippery fish. Yeah.  That you like. I'll remember that you'll never remember it. I know now that I remember it. So if a good one pops into my head I will literally run away in a restaurant. I'll get up and run. Yeah. And like what the fuck is he doing. Do you audio.  Like sometimes you sometimes do sometimes audio while also sometimes of like of him high especially. And I think I'm not going to remember this, I have to say it because I don't, I don't, I won't remember it while I'm writing it because it's really high, you know.  So you're like this in the middle of writing. I'm like, what was I saying? So I have to say it because it's quick, right?  You know, so I have like when I swipe down on my iPhone, there's the audio recorder is one of the things that's built in there.  Yeah. That's just wiped down.  Hit that and start yapper. That helps.  But the other thing is like sitting and sometimes they're just ideas that I have that I bounce around in my head while I'm driving around. I'm trying to figure out how to work it out and then I bring them on stage raw. Sometimes I haven't even written it down. You just fuck around with it on stage to see if I can find a place for it.  But then the big thing to me is also sitting in front of a computer and I know a lot of comics don't like that, but I'm some of my best bits of come from sitting down and going over the bit and going over material and also writing essays like I write essays. And so I'll write like a, you know, a couple thousand words, but I'll extract a sentence. Right. And that one sentence will be a bit. But if I don't sit and write that, I don't get that sentence right.  Right. And a lot of comics say, oh, I write on stage. I'm like, yeah, I do too.  I do too. But I also make myself sit down like I need a new hour every two years, really a new hour every year, because the last year is really just hammering the samurai sword down ping.  It's, you know, honing the blade. Yeah, but the metal has to be in position after a year. Yeah. Yeah. So I have to get something and you got like you can come up with it on your own. You could just, just, just talk and go on stage and socialising with friends. A lot of times things come out socialising with friends. Good ideas will pop into my head like you're laughing and having fun. You say something crazy, you should use that and write that down.  But there's no substitute for actually writing. Yeah, for sitting down and writing. Yeah.  Just sitting your ass in that chair and doing the work. It's, it's like it doesn't hurt.  Yeah. And this is what I tell young comics like well I really feel comfortable writing like that because it always comes out forced. Yeah. I get better at it. Yeah. Yeah. Like that's the argument that I've talked to comics that, that just do crowd work. Yeah. Whatever I do bits it seems fake.  I'm like well that's because they're not good. Yeah. Yeah. You get better at doing that. Do you like crowd work.  I do it if some shit is going on. Yeah. But you know, I just you know, I'll do it occasionally just to have fun.  Yeah. But I feel like there's. It's a weird sort of fake immediacy, like there's a fake energy, like, oh my God, it's coming out of nowhere, you know, this is so much funnier than it really is because that's people are laughing really loud and all because they know that you're coming up with it in the moment.  Right. It's fun sometimes, but there's no substitute for real bits.  Yeah, like a real killer bit. That's what I like when I would listen to Richard Pryor or Sam Kinison or I wanted those fucking perfectly honed chunks.  Yeah. You know, that's like Chappelle.  I mean, God, I watch his stuff. I'm like he is like a master class, just the way that he constantly misdirections.  Like the joke's always on you. Yeah. Yeah. Just so I mean that opening to the most recent one. Sticks and stones. Yeah.  Just it's just how he manages to bring it back to the Anthony Bourdain thing. And then he's like and this guy I mean he's just it's he's just a master.  You see somebody who's so gifted at that.  We're so dedicated. Did you ever I feel this way about Colin Quinn, actually, that New York special that he did.  Did you ever see that? No, I haven't. For it is Kyle's genius. He's a genius. I watched it and watched it again immediately because I was like, what the how the fuck did he just do that?  He tells the whole history of New York and it's all in jokes. And Seinfeld directed it.  It's on Netflix. It is genius. I've never seen anything like it, really. It was like the history of New York in an alley. Unappreciated, so unappreciated.  Yeah. Yeah. And comics appreciate. I remember one time I did tough crowd and Colin was working the he was warming up the audience and he just did a standup.  So there's an audience there to see tough crowd. And Colin is just doing standup for the audience and it is so good.  I remember thinking afterwards, like, well stand up was so much better than the show itself.  Yeah.  I was like, it's kind of interesting. Yeah. Yeah. Like people don't know how good he is. He's so good.  His red state, blue state that he did is genius. It's like aired on CNN and now it's on Netflix. But it was a roast of all 50 states. It's freaking hilarious.  Amazing. He's yeah. He's really under I feel like underappreciated. What what have you learned in your time off? Like, what have you learned about your comedy? Have you what are your.  I can live without it and learn that. Oh, I can survive.  Well yeah. Without it. I mean you're not twitchy. Oh well I got twitchy the one time I did it did it in Houston.  I did a weekend at the Improv but then I got twitchy about giving people the covid I got where I'm like, what if I got it? And then I gave it to somebody. Yeah, that would worry me.  So getting weirded out about that, I got weirded out about, like, you know, someone who's compromised getting it.  Yeah, yeah. My carelessness. And then I thought about I was like also.  And then there's people that are in the audience like, are you responsible if people come to see you and then someone in the audience gets covid like, are you responsible?  Not directly. Not directly. But it's like second hand. Feel guilt free. Yeah, no, I don't feel guilt free.  Like if you find out that a fan who loved you but was overweight and they came to see you and they got covid and died after your show like yeah. You feel horrible. You feel horrible. If you were so I decided, OK, this is not I don't know if there's a way to do this where people don't get sick.  What about the drive? There's aren't people doing that that seems wack. I know.  Loves them. Burt loves them. But Burt's crazy. Yeah. And he's always drunk.  So it's like it's hard to it's hard to is having a blast. He loves it. Yeah. But Burt just wanted to perform, you know, and he figured out a way to do it. I mean I'm pretty sure that the drive in movie comedy thing was his idea.  Oh wow. I think he's the one that started doing it and he's the one for sure who's doing it on the biggest scale. He told me he did a show. I how many people were.  There you go. Seven hundred cars. Oh wow. Seven hundred cars. That's crazy. It's a lot of people. Yeah. You got to figure that's like fourteen hundred people. Yeah.  Maybe more. Yeah.  And you know he said at the end of it they were flashing their lights, it was like a fucking UFO, he said. So that's kind of cool.  Listen he just wanted to be out there. Yeah. You know, he just wanted to be out there doing stand up and it's going well. He's selling out all over the place.  I feel bad for the comedians who were like just getting that momentum, you know, the ones that were grinding and grinding and grinding. Because I've been thinking a lot about this just with covid how much momentum was just stopped all over the world?  Just the momentum for musicians. You know, I heard this story about a musician, people starting business.  I just stopped. Yeah, people going to college sports.  But these comedians who aren't making money or we're musicians who aren't making money but only make money touring. Yeah, but we're just about to start making money.  Maybe not even like like my friend Ali Ali Makowski, she was she was opening for me, just really starting to get paid work and then was actually starting the headline. And then, oh, went away. Yeah, I mean, she was living with her mom. Oh, wow. Yes. No, there's no money.  There's no money. Like, how do you make money? Yeah. The only way a comic survives today is if they started a podcast before all this shit. Yeah. And I have been telling comics this from the fucking job.  You are the one who told me to start mine. Yes. And you listen. I did. You told me.  I remember where I was. It was at the Comedy Store and you were like, start a podcast. I was like, uh, Joergen tells you to stand by, guys. I guess I was like, look, I mean, it's it's very successful now.  The thing is, it's it's a vehicle for you to be independent and to not just make money, but also to get your voice out there. Yeah. You can get your opinions out there in a way that you don't have anybody leaning over your shoulder like I had. There was a time where I was doing the rounds with some radio people where there was like some offers for me to do a radio thing.  And I was like, oh, well, there's going to be like someone telling me what I can and can't say.  Right. There's going to be someone bringing me guests like this guy going to come in and that guy's going to come in.  I'm like, I could probably make do with that. But it would also be those there's uncomfortable moments. I remember when I did radio or the I knew the deejay did not want me there.  Right. If they weren't a fan of my comedy or the deejays or weird people. And they're like comics and a lot of ways, but a lot of them are like comics that never did comedy.  Right. Right. I have this, like, insecurity about the comics that are out there battling. Yeah. You know, I remember one guy was mad because he said it looked like he had about two hours sleep.  He smelled like liquor. I'm like, yeah, yeah, I'm a comic. Yeah, yeah. I did have two hour sleep. I did smell like liquor. We were up having a good time. I had a show last night, motherfucker.  Yeah. You know, we were up until four o'clock in the morning just laughing. And then I came here at six.  Yeah, that's what happened. Fuck. Do you expect this is what I do, man. I'm a comedian, but there's something about the person who just the comic the like.  A lot of DJ's I think secretly wanted to be comics just because they'll try to be funny.  They try to be witty, witty, modern guy. Yeah, yeah. But they never they never put their balls in a wheelbarrow, made it onto that stage.  Yeah. They never do. So you're like no radio sticking with the podcast. Well I just didn't I didn't think anybody was going to hire me.  But the problem was I was worried about having a place where I could just say what I wanted to say. Yeah.  I always knew someone's going to tell me not to do something. Yeah. Yeah.  Like, it's so annoying when you say something funny and someone's like, you can't say that.  Oh, you fuck. There was an episode of Fear Factor once with this lady could not reach her hand into this barrel.  This is a barrel of worms to pull out a piece of paper and the piece of paper I think would say you have to eat one worm or no worms.  And I'm pretty sure she was vegan, too. So she couldn't eat a worm and stuff to kill a thing was hilarious.  So I go, just put your hand in there and grab the paper just like I can.  I could. But you definitely can trust me. You can do it. You put your hand in there, you grab the paper and you do it. I go, it's not that hard. I'm telling you, it's all in your head. I'm going to help you through it. And she's like, I just can't.  I can't. I go, you're saying you can't? But that's not true. It's difficult. But you can. I go watch. I'm going to do it. I go I want to watch. And I put my hand in there and I pull out a piece of paper. I see that I go, that's why only men get to be president.  And she was so mad at me that I know I'm joking. I know you can do like, but NBC wouldn't have to do it.  They cut it out. And I remember this conversation I had with the producers. I was like, why can't you say that? I go, you understand? I'm joking, right? They will have a lot of people going to get mad. I go, you know, a lot of people get mad at jokes.  Yeah, but it's pretty clear that I'm joking. And, you know, I'm a comedian and everybody else does, too. So what are we doing? Like, what are we doing? Yeah, I remember that feeling.  I'm like, it's going to be that. It's going to be that all day. Yeah. That all the time. It's going to be that.  But podcasts are the only place where a comic can say whatever the fuck they want. Yeah, but what I've been telling comics from the jump is this is the only place where you can do this.  Yeah, well, you don't have any other people doing. Thankfully, a lot of people have listen, particularly like Tom SIGIR and Christine like Tom of their conversation, they're awesome.  They're moved out here. I got out this week. She's I just love her. Yeah. I hooked them up, my real estate agent. So we were in the middle of this lockdown and me and Tom on the phone, he goes, Dude, thank God you told me to do this podcast. Yeah. He knows what the fuck he goes. I was making so much money touring, and then I was like basing my lifestyle off of that.  No one ever thought the plug would be. Yeah, no one ever saw this coming. But not just that they've established who they are through that podcast. Yeah. In a way. Like, you realize how silly he is. Yeah. How silly they are. Yeah. So yeah. Awesome. They're great. They're my feet.  Well they're not my favorite. Yeah they are. They're my favorite comedy club. Yeah.  But there's a bunch of other ones like Bonnie McFarlane. Yeah. And Rich Vos. Yeah. And Natasha LÃ¡zaro and motion capture.  There's a few that work. Yeah. And that's the answer to these people that say like oh comedians just never date other comedians.  So yeah. My out there one headshot per couple.  Yeah. It's very, it's a good theory most of the time. Yeah. But like all theories there's always a yeah there are some the work obviously I think they don't I the thing I love about Tom and they just don't take themselves very seriously at all or their opinions.  Yeah. They're, they're not the people even though they're super successful, they're not the people that tell you what you should and shouldn't do. Yeah. No, it's that shit's gross.  I don't want to do that. That's what it's like you were saying earlier about the just letting people kind of find their path, because I what worked for me isn't going to work for them. And this is what we're hearing from, you know, these kind of extremes is what's right for me is what's right for everybody.  What's right for me is what you have to do. Yeah. And if I think something you must comply. Yeah. If I believe something you can't say a thing you can't think a thing. You must do this. You've got to adhere to this or that. You know, there's just so much madness in the world when it comes to this shit.  It's weird. It's interesting. Like I understand, you know, kind of clearly I am confused and I, I understand.  Right. When he started wearing the magic hat, I was like, I get it. I get it.  Because there was so much pressure, especially like in L.A. And when you're living in that liberal bubble state, there's so much ideological pressure.  I could feel it. I could feel myself not wanting to say things. And that's why I just was like, fuck it. I'm saying whatever I want on Twitter, I'll pay the consequences, whatever they might be. And I'm not going to censor myself. And, you know, I have the whole theory of on Twitter.  If you get, like a lot of followers for one tweet, you have to immediately tweet something that's the opposite so that you can weed out all the like zealots and ideologues, because that's the only way to purify following from, like, the radicals.  Yeah. And does it work? It does work. I feel like because I can see it in my mentions for the most part. My like the people who follow me are like in on the joke. And there are some really smart, funny people and I love it when they contribute to the joke like I did my mentions because they're usually freaking hilarious. And then there's always like one idiot who's like, oh, this is the most obvious grift I've ever seen.  I'm like, do you just. Yeah, yeah.  That grift word. There's too many dorks that are using that word. I know he's a grifter because I like using the word.  There are a lot of people that are fucking grifters, but there's too many people using that word. It's a good word. It's one of those words.  One word. It's a really fun.  It's a fun word to say it has a good accurate. Yeah. I'll tell you where to find grifter's. Here's a fun thing to do that I should start just the segment on my podcast. I love reading Yelp reviews of psychics.  You want to talk about fucking grifters?  I guess I could read these for hours.  You want comedy? Go, go read psychic reviews. On Yelp, yeah, there they are, nothing but grift. They're like, I came in and he didn't remember my name, he should have known my name when I walked in the scenes that are set, like I showed up and this woman was babysitting her grandchild and then she needed me to give them a ride. I'm like, these people who are psychics are insane. It's amazing.  All of your audience should take a moment, go read some psychic Yelp reviews.  When you're feeling down, you immediately feel better about all these people that want you to know that they know a psychic that's real. Like, dude, I'm telling you, she knows. She just knows things. You've got to talk to her.  I had a girl on my podcast who is addicted to psychics. And I was like, oh, come on, how bad could it have been? And she was like, I spent sixty thousand dollars on psychics last year.  I'm like, OK, that's an addiction. Whoa. How did she have that much money?  I mean, I think she had good she had decent money, but making money, if you make more than 60000 dollars a year, you're probably not that much of a moron.  Right. But you've done well. I mean, you have that money to blow on psychics. That's that's that's what's confusing about it.  It's crazy. It's crazy. And I think it got to the point where her psychic started feeling guilty because he told her that she had to cut her off.  That's like a drug dealer, Larry.  Bro, you taking in too much of this crack? I thought she was kidding when she said her psychic cut her off. Yeah. My God, that's fucking amazing. That's a whack. It was a wacky interview.  Is it dirty people? They're evil people. Those people in the science, people. Those are even evil. Or you're your father's talking to me from beyond the grave.  I sense he misses you. Yeah. Oh, give him money. Give me money. I was talking to you. Dad.  Dad, do you believe in any kind of psychic powers?  I think I think it is it is likely that there are evolving senses that we are aware of and that we recognize, but that no one in this current state of evolution has a handle on how to control them.  I think there are moments when you think about people and they call you. I think there are times when you know someone's lying. There's a feeling you get when you know someone secretly hates you.  Right. Is this weird things where you go, I knew that fucker did something. And I don't know.  Those are body language that you're picking up. It could be that. Yeah, it could be that. But there's also things like when you think about someone and they call. Yeah, people say, oh, that's a coincidence. It you're right. It could be a coincidence. Yeah. But I'm not buying that all the time. I think sometimes it's a coincidence, but I think sometimes there's a strange interconnectedness to life.  Yeah. And I think that we used to be animals with no language. Yeah. And then we develop language and you're basically when you're talking to me, when you and I are talking and you're speaking with your language, you're making sounds. And I read your mind through those sounds and I recognize those sounds mean particular things. I put them into my own organisation of what they mean to me, and they mean different things to different people, which is why it gets things get confusing.  It's also why I'm so ruthlessly opposed to compliance, because you're forcing me to accept your definition of what these sounds mean and what that means in terms of like what what the actual context of it is and what what, what what the intent is behind these sounds. And it's creepy and sneaky.  Yeah, wildly debunked. Yes. But I think exactly while it's been widely debunked by my opinion, it drives me crazy, but also just words you can and can't say.  And yeah, but there's something about human beings where I feel like there is a connection that's like almost there.  Yeah. It's like it comes together sometimes. It's like just every now and then you get it but you don't always have it. There's something. And when you do mushrooms you have it in a big way. Yeah.  You know, one of the things of ayahuasca, when they first discovered ayahuasca, one of the ingredients that was later recognized as being already discovered to be a compound called harming, they they started calling it telepathy.  And so the first people that were studying ayahuasca, the first scholars that were studying it were the researchers were calling it telepathy until they realized that, you know, do the rules of scientific nomenclature had already been established. That was Hami.  So they knew what the thing. But they were calling it telepathy because through this compound, people were having these shared experiences without talking. And then when they relayed these experiences, they were actually communicating without talking. And they were saying there's a type of. Telepathy that's possible with this drug, I think I think we are becoming something, and if we don't interfere, we probably will technologically and with neural link and all these other crazy things if we don't interfere.  I think we will ultimately become more and more in tune with that, our ability to sense things and communicate nonverbally and read each other nonverbally. There's something about there's something about us where we connect in this way that is you can't measure it. Yeah. Put it on a scale. You can't put a tape measure to it, but there's something to it.  I agree. My my best friend and I have always had that psychic connection and we just thought the adults weren't witches like we were and that they.  So we always developed it. And to this day I can be like, call me Sarah, tell them telepathically.  And she will literally within like a day it feels like I'll hear from her randomly.  And it's just that we, like, intuitively know when we need each other.  And I worked with autistic kids for a while and part one of my many jobs. And I kind of have a weird theory that.  Autism and the rise of it is the human brain and evolution, and it just hasn't we're kind of catching it mid evolution because those kids have. Amazing gifts. I saw some crazy shit working with autistic kids, just things that didn't make any sense. Like my one example, I was working with a kid and he was nonverbal and we were in the playroom and he was you know, he kept he was obsessed with flies. He would get obsessed with different things at different times.  And he would look up and then look back and look up. And he was then we were like, I thought it was locked.  It wasn't. And he runs out of the room, suddenly runs through the laundry room, runs into the kitchen, and then midair grabs a fly as it's flying.  Yeah, I saw this. I was running on his heels trying to catch him. I was like, what the fuck?  And then he brings it back into the playroom and he would like basically play with the fly until eventually it died.  And that was just one of the I mean, there were so many moments like that with all these different kids where I'm like, they're tapped into something else. Yeah.  And if you lived in a world and say you had a sixth sense, say that you had say that you lived in a world where nobody could see and you were the only person who could see, you'd be banging your fucking head on the wall to if you could see. And everyone was like, what are you talking about?  So sometimes I wonder if it's not they're not like you're saying, maybe the brain is evolving and we're just catching it just doesn't fit in society. So they're they're feeling because there's a lot.  I don't know, I just saw so many of the autistic kids are just some amazing, some people have that feeling when it comes to autism and autistic kids, that maybe that's an emerging type of consciousness and that even though we're looking at today as being a detriment. Right. That it might be the standard in the future.  Yeah, I mean, they have amazing because like you were saying, we're animals and we've done I've always been fascinated with how out of touch we are with our instincts because they still run the show for all of us. Yeah, most people right now, there's so much fear in that you can feel it everywhere. There's so much fear. Yeah. Everyone's in fear, fear, fear, fear, fear everywhere. And that drives so much of this behavior that we're seeing like tribalism and trying to be a tyrant and rule over people and feeling like you have to stop anything that doesn't make you feel that even that language, I don't feel safe.  What does that because of words like what does that even fucking mean? I don't feel safe. I'm not OK. You don't feel safe by my words, but you like burning down a city is supposed to be OK.  You know, it's a weird we live in like weird times where there's so much, but I feel like.  I think it was really shown in the tsunami, remember that a huge tsunami that was in like 2006 was in 2005?  No, not the one in Japan, the Indian Ocean and all the animals ran away and all the humans ran to go see all the shells and shit and why the ocean was there are tons of people who drowned because they were like, what's happening?  Yeah. And that's just evidence to me of how out of touch with I wonder if our ancestors would have made that same mistake where they're like, what's happening? I don't know. I don't know. Or would they have been like, we're getting that. We're following the animals?  Well, there's a real wonder like what kind of what kind of understanding of animals and of the land and and storms coming and all sorts of shit that animals seem to tune into. Did we lose. Yeah. When we, you know, had houses and did we lose.  That is what I'm wondering. Wonder, right. Or did we just never have it and we're morons.  Maybe, maybe not.  Well don't you think also we're so much more capable of expressing ourselves, we're so much more occupied with tasks and things and whether it's information or computers or TV or different people that we're talking to constantly, that the mind is overwhelmed. Yeah. And that. How much time do you spend in the woods?  I spend a lot of time in nature.  Well, when you're there and you hear nothing, I love it. It's weird. Oh, I like there's a weird quiet to the to the mountains, like there's a desert.  So yeah I love it. And it also it's humbling because lets you know you're not shit.  That's why I love the desert. Yeah. I love it because it puts me in my place. Yeah.  It's like everything in the desert has evolved to survive the harshest conditions on earth and everything there is either trying to kill you or will kill you.  Yeah. And there's something about that, that painful evolution that all the plants and animals had to undergo that just speaks to me. And just even the harsh I mean, it's like nine o'clock in the morning. You're like, it's so high, I want to die.  And it's also it doesn't care about, you know, this ecosystem has existed long before you ever here. And it's it's all working together.  The bugs are working with the lizards, with the snakes and the plants and all the little water that there is and the coyotes and all this shit is working together. Yeah. And it's man maintaining this this system.  But I love that. I mean, that's the thing that I, I feel like people are losing when they're looking down into these demonic boxes all day long. Is that connection to, you know, having your feet kind of being made of mud, but also made of stars that famous, quote, butchering? But we are made of stardust that we are part. You know, I'll look out at the stars and be like, what the fuck?  I'm part of this. I'm not even high. And I can experience that trip of yeah, we aren't separate from I'm not looking at the stars.  It's like I'm part of that crazy. And we're all just it's such a miracle that we're here in this time and space. Yeah. And it's such a wild trip and we're and we have more than we've ever had in the in the history of humans. And we're wasting it tearing each other apart. It actually hurts my soul.  There's a lot of wasted energy.  That's why when I see people you know and people like how OK, little miss captain of the fence writing team, we should ride fences. I'm going to get a shirt that says fence writing right where you are truly the captain.  Listen, I don't I'm not married to any of my thoughts.  Yeah. I don't think I think it's good to question everything, including yourself. Yeah.  And there's some thoughts like, hey, don't murder people. Yeah. Don't steal, don't rape, don't you know, don't like Teletubbies.  A lot of things. You know, people don't drown all people like.  Yeah.  There's a lot of like real clear ones but but when it comes to whether it's government or behavior or ideology or any of the things that we hold so rigid, I think it's really dangerous. It's really dangerous to look at things. The way we look at things. We have these non pliable opinions. Yeah. Yeah. And also connect all of our own feelings of importance to these opinions being valid. Yeah.  Connect who you are as a person like who you're your value as a person to whether or not the opinions that you hold are true.  Yes, she will fight to the death for those opinions. Well, that's a common it's so common. That was like all the Trump supporters who are in my comments. It was like I attacked them personally, like I had gone to their house and personally attacked them and their mom. Yeah.  And told them that they were shit. Mike, you guys you can't personally identify. With politicians are the biggest pieces of shit ever, they are dropped off a politician. That's why we love the swamp. I love it when we're not listening to Hollywood. I'm like, you're your hero is Hollywood, you know? What are you talking about?  Well, that's hilarious. And when people call you Hollywood, like, what does that mean? No. It mean show business?  No, it's it's I just I feel like we deserve better. Yeah.  We just, you know, and this election makes me feel like we definitely do. We deserve and but we don't.  But we don't. We deserve this because this is where we've left it, left it to this like nobody wants to be fucking president. There's a few people that you could get behind, like Tulsi Gabbard. There you go. I just I think that's who she is. I mean, I don't think there's any bullshit there, but there's very few of those the people that are willing to run for president. This is the kind of people that are willing to do this, because most of the people, most of the people that think about to go, oh, my fucking skeletons, I have a friend of mine.  That's funny, but that's what I mean. I was just thinking it would be a shit job and I would hate it and I would hate myself because I think by the time you get there, in order to even maneuver, you have to sell yourself out so many times that you don't even know what you think about how many people are just waiting to attack anybody who's running for president.  Yeah, and about the way they ramp up their their attacks and and the machine behind it. It's not as simple as like I'm Joe Biden and I think Donald Trump is a fucking loser. Yeah.  So I'm going to say that, no, there's like a whole machine with literally billions of dollars on the line because if our team gets in there, then we can push our agenda. Right. We can get certain bills passed. We can get certain legislation through. We can make sure that certain regulations like the court.  Yes. And it can literally one way or the other impact corporations in this spectacular way. Yeah.  So they have to really, really put a lot of effort into it. So the idea that that we allow that that's that's where things get crazy like it should be. It's almost like if you want to run for president, you almost should have no help.  Like no one knows what it'd be like grassroots. Like they take you and they take away your phone and they keep you in a hotel room and they just bring you a place to place and no one gets to talk to you. Isn't that bizarre?  She's pretty grassroots or she has like a whole organization to have a tried the justice, what do they call the squad squad.  But they also have like the what's what is it is it the like Democratic Justice League or something like Superfriends?  It's like the it's a pretty socialist, I think, organization.  Well, she's got a lot of people that also agree with her that are also in politics and they also work together. And, you know, and then she's compromised some of her own democratic socialism.  Oh, yeah. Yeah. Well, I can't wait until she's a Republican and like ten years back.  Well, you're telling me that you would read some of your shit.  Oh, my God, I'm going to find it for you. I just like it is it is like it was a part of the book when I was waiting tables telling everyone to remember my name and drunk all the time.  I was I was super there is a whole part where I was talking about, but I didn't know anything about politics at all. But I was I was just so I was.  Liotard Like the definition by definition of what what they the right would consider a Liotard.  That was.  Well, you weren't hardened yet by the world. I mean, I was pretty hardened and I had had enough shit up and pre prior to twenty three that. Yeah.  You were still hopeful that these sort of airy fairy idealistic notions of, you know, what should be done with our culture and that this would work and with no understanding of economics, no understanding or I think it's good to be that hopeful.  I don't think you should go burn down government buildings and be like, yeah, let's tear it all down. But I think it's good to have that idealistic hope. And what does that famous quote like your your if you don't if you're not a Democrat in your twenties, you don't have a heart and if you're not a Republican in your 30s, you don't have a brain or something like that or you're not a conservative. It's an old yeah.  It's an old saying if you're not a liberal as a youth, you have no heart, you know, conservative as you're older, you have no brain.  I'm and I'm not really either because, you know, I'm not socially conservative at all. Me neither. I mean, that's why they it's funny.  When people were like, oh, she's just a grifter. She's gotten red pills and she's going to be on the right now. And then the right will start talking about porn or something.  I'm like, oh, thank God I'm not one of them are sex. Sort a weird shit.  Weird shit. Yeah. Or you know, whether or not I mean. You know, these ideas that you have to be one or the other is where it's so stupid.  Yeah, you can hold both things. That is what we should be doing.  We should be holding both things and evaluating that.  Yeah, well, especially it's really difficult for me when people want to restrict other people's ability to express themselves or do things, whether it's.  You know, gay rights or trans rights or civil rights or women's rights or anytime you want to stop people from doing something that literally has nothing to do with you.  Yeah, you know, the gay rights one movement, the gay marriage one was always weird to me.  When I was seven years old, I was seven years old. We moved to Florida and I had this this Cuban friend. His name was Candy Candido. That was his last name was Candido. And they called him Candy. I love that. And his dad was so mad.  He had a newspaper. He's slamming it down on the fucking table. And we're like, what's the matter?  He's like, they're going to let these fags marry each other. Oh, my gosh. He was. I was how old I eleven. Yeah, I was 11 because I'd moved from San Francisco, so I was 11. And I remember thinking, what a fucking idiot. This guy's a grown man.  See, I lived in San Francisco from seven to 11, so I was like I was right down the street from Lombards. Yeah. So we were around like my next door neighbors.  They would get naked. There were these gay guys.  They would get naked with my aunt and they would smoke pot, play the bongos. And that was my life when I was seven years old. So I was so used to gay people. Yeah. So normal.  Yeah.  That being around this guy when I was 11, I was like, this is so weird, so weird cause I moved from from San Francisco to Florida. Oh. Gainesville, Florida. Which was so dumb.  Yeah. And the apartment complex. So it was like people weren't doing so good and they were so dumb and it was too hot. It's too hot to be smart. It's something I think about Florida. It's like God damn, it's so hot down there can't be smart.  It's hard, it's hard, you know, that's gone. But I was just saying that like so I don't understand why people who are conservative, like why if you're fiscally conservative, that makes sense.  If you're financially conservative, if you believe in the Second Amendment, you have all these ideas about rights, like we have rights.  But why do you give a fuck if people get married? Like what I do.  Caitlyn Jenner, when she transitioned, was against gay marriage. Oh, weird. She's like I've always been more of a traditional girl.  What? She knows that true. Oh, yeah, on the Ellen Show, Ellen and Ellen confronted her about it. Wow. And it was like, what? What happened to what that what I don't understand what.  Well, she's a Republican right now. I don't know, but probably not.  Oh, but if you. I think so, maybe. But when you're a Republican, that's one of those things you're supposed to just drive.  Seems like they've they've accepted that. That's not a battle they're winning.  Well, it's evolution of the culture. Like at a certain point in time.  I don't you know, any gay people that are cool. Yeah. Because you really give a fuck if they get married. Yeah. Marriage is dumb.  Anybody dumb enough to get married should be allowed to give away the shit. We were in Arizona and this guy was talking about his daughter and he and she is gay and divorced. And I was like, oh, I'm glad the gays know a divorce, although now they're probably going to regret fighting for that marriage like they're paying for half an hour and either like shit.  Melissa Etheridge is on the podcast years ago and she's been married and divorced a couple of times. And she was telling me all these women, she's got to pay alimony to alimony, too. What's that all about? Girls.  Bitches are crazy.  And I was like, oh, you could say that black woman has been divorced, is paying all these women alimony and especially like it's not like she fucked them so hard they can never work again.  Yeah, I know you used to be in a relationship with a successful person. You're not anymore time to get a job.  You know, they can't. Thank you. She looked at pussy so good. They're just confused.  They can't even fill out forms that they can't work anymore. Who's that over there?  I'm accustomed to this. I have a customer.  I think it's I think it's just right. Right. Yeah.  Customer accustomed to get my stuff. Yeah. Yeah.  I need pussy payments. That's what it was. Right. Yeah. Yeah. I think that's what it is.  It's a look I think marriage is is great. If you love someone so much you're willing to do something stupid. Yeah. That's my situation.  Yeah. My God.  I just think it's you know, it makes sense. You have family, you make sense, you have children. Because the way I felt like I felt like having a child is way more of a commitment than anything financial.  You feel like you're making a human being, bring them in the world and you're responsible for them for at least eight years.  At least now it's like 25. Dude, I know people that are 40 that live with your parents, right? That's. Yeah, especially during covid. It's tough. Yeah. Yeah. It's all become like European families.  Yeah. Yeah, it's intergenerational.  Well you got to survive. Yeah. The reality is like it's not a bad idea to pool all your resources together and try to survive and help each other. Right. Because we really are at a crossroads.  Yeah.  Like when, when you realize it makes us realize how good we had it for so many years when you know people the economy was booming and people could be independent and out there supporting themselves. But then when all that shit is literally cut in half like you got to make, do you have to figure it out? Yeah.  Yeah. And I think it's better for people to be around other people. Yeah. Because all my friends who have been isolated, you know, people it's way more open here. Oh yeah.  My friends in L.A. are losing their minds who have been alone because it's been going on like six months.  That is way more open here. Yeah, way more open.  And that's why I love it. Yeah. It, it feels normal. Yeah, it does.  It just feel you wear a mask. Yeah. I go to a restaurant. It's crazy and amazing. It's nice. Nice. I mean it's been nice to just feel kind of what normal was.  Retail stores are open. You got a retail store, put a mask on and L.A. definitely.  I mean it's when I was walking my dog in L.A. every single day, I have to avoid a crazy there was a guy with a machete. There was. And then I walked out and then I was two days. Every walk I go on, there's basically like a crazy homeless young woman who's out alone and they're having some kind of breakdown and it gets worse and worse every day.  It's like it is deteriorating faster than I could have even imagined.  And it makes me mad because the government doesn't give a fuck about me. They don't care about my safety. I'm supposed to have endless compassion for the homeless and they don't care that there's a guy with a machete having a having a moment. They don't care.  They can't do anything about it. They can their their only job is to keep some what keep me safe as a citizen. That is what they if why am I paying taxes if they can't do that. This is why I'm like, fuck you California.  You got taxes to keep these politicians fed. OK, but they need to make sure that I'm not getting attacked. I walk my dog.  But that's the problem with some some place as big as L.A. There's like a diffusion of responsibility thing that you get to when you get to numbers that are so high.  When you get like twenty million people, you know, borders, there's like an expression about how not an expression, but there's an example about how when people. We'll see someone getting attacked, like if there's only one person there and someone's getting attacked, you feel responsible to help. But if you're in a crowd and attacking someone else, yeah, everyone assumes someone else is going to jump in and nobody does anything. Yeah, but it's not nobody feels responsible.  It's been notably worse. You know, there has to be something. People are paying tons of money. I was in Venice. I was in Brentwood. These people are paying millions of dollars in taxes and they have encampments across the street from their house, their kids playing. Yeah, it's not safe for them. You know, they're there. Something has to. We were it's interesting, too. I mean, to me and I were talking about this because they before just the way I don't even know if they know how many actual homeless people are there, because I volunteered once to be part of the homeless count.  And that's how they count the homeless as volunteers who go through L.A. for like one weekend and count as many homeless people as they can. And you write down what street you're on.  Yeah.  And you, like, go in little groups and come and you find I didn't I never I was out of town that weekend and my aunt was like, please don't do that.  But I legitimately was out of town that weekend, so I ended up not being able to do it.  But I was like, oh, cool, this is how they count the homeless.  But that doesn't seem like a very good measure of how many there homeless people out there. I bet it's probably twice as many as it actually reports. How are you getting.  Yeah, that's a lot of people, 70000. They say now they think New York City is 80000.  Wow. There's New York City. They should be in L.A. It's a way.  Better place, better place to be homeless. Yeah, well, he like tolerable. Well, because now under the underpass. Yeah. But during covid they've loosened all those restrictions.  So used to be like you couldn't block the sidewalk and you couldn't with your we saw somebody grilling a frickin like it was a huge fire on a grill on the side of the road.  It was like a hibachi or some shit like one just having a grill in the middle and there's women with their strollers trying to watch.  It's madness. Oh, I don't know. And I have that's the one I feel like it's the one problem.  If I could solve, I would focus on solving it because it's on homosocial, because it's such a crossroads of economics, mental illness, addiction.  It's so many things that are abuse.  I was watching a video about this kid and he was twenty eight and he's been homeless literally on the streets since he was nine years old. He's he was in a car with his mom. They were living in a car till they were eleven. And then from eleven on he was on the street. Oh yeah. It was terrible.  And he was talking about I mean he he had no teeth. Like, his front teeth were gone. He had his face reconstructed, his arm smashed. I'm going to beat him up with a bat. He you know, he'd been sexually abused. It didn't have any socks. He didn't have any shoes. He didn't have anything. Yeah. He had you know, he talked about the the small amount of clothes he had. And it's kind of weird because he was.  You know, really, for a person who has been homeless and on the street in this horrible life since he was nine kind of seemed pretty together, like the way he was talking, communicating, Lisa, in this video.  And, you know, you realize this is the thing about people when you if you're mad at someone, say if you're mad at someone for their behavior, like, say, if you're if you're a gay person, you're mad that Caitlyn Jenner doesn't believe in gay marriage, even though she wanted to transition and wants you to call her a woman now.  Instead of being mad and I guess you could be mad at the idea, but I think what we really need to start doing is look like what what happened?  How did you get like? What all what are all the things that took place in your life that that you turned into this right now, like what are those things?  You know, this is the concept of determinism, right? This is the concept that there is no real free will. Everyone is sort of an accumulation of all the experiences they've had, their genetics, their life, all the different factors that are out of their control, along with the decisions that they've made because of these factors and all your emotions and you got genes and drug addiction and all these different things. And it brings you to this point, and I think this is the thing with homeless people that we need to take into consideration as well, because when you see someone who's homeless, you know, like, oh, this fucking loser, oh, they're a drug addict.  Get them away from my house. The amount of.  Undoing, you have to have to take a 40 year old person who's grilling in front of a house in Venice with heroin tracks all over their arm and make them a reasonable contributor to a healthy person who can, you know, kind of do anything.  And I know I know there's so much. And I have I do have endless compassion. But on the other hand, there's a lot of entitlement. There's a lot of entitlement in that in the homeless community. There is.  But they don't have anything. Like if you don't have anything and you look at people who have things, look, this is one of the things you're seeing with a lot of these riots, a lot of the looting and all the craziness. It's like haves and have nots. Yeah. And they have to classify these motherfuckers. How and why do they have this, especially during covid? Because everybody has nothing, right? These homeless people don't have anything.  They feel entitled because they don't have anything. And you do.  And there's a weird thing that people people have this thought that if you have something and they don't have it, it's because there's an injustice and you have contributed to this injustice or you've caused this injustice. That's where the entitlement comes. And this is a it's a real problem in the way Americans and particularly think about in particular, think about economics.  Yeah, it's resentment politics. Yeah. It's all resentment. And you can get a lot of people to agree with you.  Oh, yes. Most people most people also don't have good things. Like I was reading this tweet from this girl was talking about, you know, like we we need to start going into the suburbs and going into these people's houses. Yeah. And then she wrote Eat the Rich.  Yeah, that's a big thing right now. And I was like, what are you talking about? So you're 24. OK, what do you think is going to happen when you're 44 and you're one of those people?  Yeah, exactly. Is going to be happy with that. You're happy when you're tired because you've been working all day trying to achieve a dream and you're exhausted and you see these people outside your house.  How the fuck do you have this house? How are you in that house? So comfortable as fuck. Yeah, well, we're out here.  You know, I'm sure you've seen some of those people. Oh, it's video. There is one video from, I think Kenosha. And this guy, I'm not sure if that's where it was from, but I it just stuck with me. He was like yelling at the they had smashed his windows and he was like, I have fucking mouths to feed.  He's like, do you want everybody to vote for Trump? I have fucking mouths to feed. What are you doing?  And like they'd smashed is where you know, you don't know what they're doing. They don't know what they're doing.  And so many so many of the kids on the streets are truly kids like seventeen.  Yes. Children that I like.  Where are your parents? We have a fucking parenting problem. The kid in Kenosha that went up killing those are they on Instagram?  The parents are like, oh, honey, go have fun. This motherfucker, he's not liking my shit. Resentment, resentment, resentment. Oh, yeah.  We you know, we have a lot of problems and there's a lot of us. And we could all like we could all do with some housecleaning and compassion.  Yeah. I think compassion for each passion clean up your own backyard, get your life together, do your best.  Nobody wants to do that shit. They want to blame everyone exactly how he wants to clean the shit in their front yard and not do drugs that are, you know, they're spending all their money on.  They want to go out and be like the Libs are ruining my life for like, yeah, burned down a fucking building.  And it's weird how there's certain environments that just tolerate like homelessness and craziness. And then those folks find those environments like Venice.  Yeah, like Venice is just about as is it's a breeding ground for it. It's crazy.  There's just so much it's such that it is really just so complex.  I don't even know how, but I don't I do wonder why some obviously some cities are doing things that where it isn't festering and exploding and some cities are.  So why don't what are what are the cities that have it somewhat under control?  What are they what's the problem? Bussing them by law and order, people like Giuliani was when, you know, he was the law and order guy, but where do they all go? That's a good question. I don't know.  I don't know what to do with them. I don't know how they help them. I don't know what they do. There was an Upper West Side thing recently where they had a hotel and they had like 300 homeless guys living in this hotel. But then they started like jerking off in front of people and, you know, taking shits on people's car stuff.  And de Blasio had to move them out. And now people are pissed off at him for taking these people out.  And, you know, it really is mostly men, mostly homeless men and was really crazy was this article that was written about it was so distorted.  It was like homeless families are being relocated when their kids are just now going to school.  Like, first of all, yes, literally this is pulling at the heartstrings. There's been a bunch of things they're doing lately to pull this.  But this was one of the most preposterous articles that I that I read. One of them was they're calling they're now calling homeless people the UN housed.  No, it's persons experiencing homelessness. We're going to be canceled for calling them the house no, it's Percelay time period. We have oh, it's I've upgraded announced the announced.  This is an article about people that were putting rocks under underpasses that when homeless people had moved out of certain areas, they were going under these underpasses and putting these enormous rocks.  Oh, so that people can get tents.  And and they were saying, do you understand what you're doing to the UN housed? These are the only places they can go to escape the elements. The reason why they go into the UN, it's literally the difference between life and death.  There. There is that that's also somewhat of a myth because there is this there are beds sometimes that go empty because people don't want to give up their drugs and weapons. Yeah.  So there the idea that like, oh, these they don't have anywhere else to go isn't always true.  Well, they're drug addicts. Bridgit, you need to take a little bit more compassion when you're making these statements, because these people that are drug addicts, they don't know what to do.  It is they need their drugs, let them just do their drugs.  Does it feel like we're on the backside of a vampire? Yeah. Yeah, it feels like Rome right before.  Yeah, yeah.  I mean, one of the things that Douglas Murray said when I interviewed him, I guess I don't interview anybody. I talk to people.  I should remember that.  But when I was talking, he was saying that at the end of every empire, there's all these gender issues or hermaphrodite, really gay.  He went into depth about it's like Rome and Greece. They always had this thing where, like, they want to break down all the there is no gender, there's no sex, there's no biology direction, deconstruct everything.  And they're also the deconstruct, all the norms, all the norms of culture. And one of the more disconcerting ones is deconstructing pedophilia.  That has been a constant one lately where you're seeing there's a weird Petto vibe everywhere.  Well, you know, that thing Duty's David O. Cutie's is crazy, OK? That's about talking about the Gavin Newsom thing.  Where did that pass? Yes, it passed and he signed it and they said it was a great victory for LGBTQ people. What?  Because before it was this is how this is this is the idea. I might be butchering it, but I'm going to do our best before.  If you had vaginal sex with a girl and impregnated her and say, like maybe you were twenty and she was fourteen, they didn't put you in a sex register list because they wanted you to be responsible for taking care of the baby they created.  So this was the idea.  But if you had anal or oral sex with her, then they would put you on the sex offender list.  Weird.  Yeah, well, it's because you're just being a pervert, right? You're just mouth fucking some fourteen year old as opposed to making a baby that you would then be responsible.  That's a weird line. So OK, but this is why they, they wanted to pass this law and this is why it would for LGBTQ folks, whatever gay people, whatever it is they wanted, they said, well, the vagina is not available to gay folks, OK, because these guys don't have a vagina.  So if you're saying there that a 20 year old can have sex with a 14 year old girl and not be put on the sex registered registry, how come a 20 year old man can have sex with a 14 year old boy and he is also a sex crime?  He's committed a sex crime and this is not fair.  So the idea is that it's in the judgment the judge gets to decide, OK, so I guess you're giving the judge the ability to decide one way or another.  So you give them the ability to discern whether or not this was someone who was in an actual relationship with a person who can commit, which is very weird, right. A person who can consent.  So but the problem with people have to give a 10 year gap.  So, you know, like like you could say 14, 24, you could say 10 and 20, like, I don't know what it means or where it's where it's defined. Yeah, that's weird.  It's crazy. But they're they're only doing it because it already existed in that form.  Right. For straight people. Right. So it's not like there's see like we're looking at it like saying oh now you're making it legal for twenty four year olds to fuck 14 year olds.  Right. Already it's already kind of like that with straight people if they have vaginal sex. Right.  Wow, that's wild. It's wild. I didn't even know that that was not you know, I don't know. That's I thought it was like statutory, I think even.  But I think if you impregnate I think this is the idea. If the person is impregnated, the judge has the ability to not put them on the sex offender list so that that person can get a job.  Right. So you could support your child. Right. Right. Especially in impoverished areas. Right. Right. That's yeah.  The whole package seems like it's everywhere. The cutest thing. That's more. Cutie's cutie's here's here's something crazy.  There was a story in Atlanta where these these guys had rescued 39 kids. Yeah. From sex slavery.  I didn't hear a fucking word. Oh, nobody asked about that. A hundred articles about Ellen being mean.  Yeah. Yeah, a hundred. Yeah. And I didn't see more than one.  It's one day in and out of the news about these 39 kids that were rescued.  Yeah, that's another one that is really I was in a rest stop. It was like a truck stop on the way here. And they had the signs, you know, it's like are you being human trafficked? And they're in rest stops across America. And it's like, are you working against your well? Are you being forced to do that?  I was like, shouldn't this be in like three other languages? There was a story, not just English, about a flight attendant.  And there was a man on a flight with a young girl, and the young girl wrote a letter and left it in the bathroom.  When the flight attendant got the letter and recognized that something was going, she she's making eye contact with the kid. She knew something was wrong. And then upon landing, they had police waiting.  Oh, wow. Yeah. Yeah. So it's I mean, that's another one where it's real. Yeah. It's a real problem. Human trafficking and sex trafficking is terrorism terrifying. Yeah. And crazy and crazy and hideous and odious and all of the worst things in the world.  And but then you have cutie's which is like what are you doing, what are they doing. I know I've seen the arguments we explain to people who don't know what the fuck you. So Cutie's is that it's a movie on Netflix. It's a foreign film.  I believe the director is French. Is she French?  Oh, that's all right, I just don't know that I'm correct about that, and it's it's supposed to be a movie about the sexual hyper sexualization and exploitation of young young girls.  Critics of Kudi say the next film, Hyper Sexualized, is a preteen dance troupe. But director Ruaha, who said Monday that she is fighting the same fight in quotes they are to stop the exploitation of young girls. So the way she stops it is by sexualizing them.  Well, I. I guess that, you know, I heard her name.  So that name my my Mona.  DoucourÃ©, quick question. Yes. Do you remember the movie Kids?  I do. Yeah. That was a pretty fun. Yeah.  That's what I that about kids being wild. And it was it was an actual movie about real kids. Yeah. But he's fucked up that direct. Yeah. That's really fucked up.  Thirteen about 13 year old. But the thing about kids is kids was a documentary now. Those are all actors. When am I thinking in the same area? Yeah, but wasn't there one there was a documentary, it was filmed a little bit like a documentary about. Oh, that's right.  It starts with sex right out of it. What year?  But it got a lot of got stuff from the library. The library in my seventh grade. Sixth grade.  Yeah, I was young too. I know. OK, I fucked up. I thought there was a documentary that guy.  Yeah. But it got a lot of shit when it came out didn't it. I feel like it was.  I think it was. I think I never saw it and I think it was out pre Internet I think.  Oh definitely pre internet 90. 94. Yeah. It was fucked up.  It was a fire hose. The director has done a lot of sketchy shit. Right. One of the movies is done. Uh.  Oh, that was a weird one. Made 20 million bucks, Hala. Hmm, yeah, but I wonder what the. I remember I feel like that was pretty controversial. Do you remember the movie?  Was it called Happy Man? Is that it?  There was a really fucking weird movie about this kid who finds out that their dad is a pedophile.  Oh, God, that was the guy is it's I think it's happy happiness. And the the guy is kind of normalized in the movie.  And it's like the kid is trying to my friends and I got into this on Twitter about the cutest thing. And, you know. I I don't know that those girls are old enough to decide to do that film, you know, so that some of the warnings on it and stuff like, I don't even want to watch it. It just seems it seems I probably should.  And just but I don't really want to for other just whatever it just seems. But my you know, I don't think it's necessarily like Netflix is problem. It seems more like a societal problem that we have.  But wait a minute, it's Netflix is a problem to have it on there and they have it on their network.  But it's it's the it's like this writer Jane Cosson said that's like the thing adjacent. She was like, has anyone been to a dance recital? Because I was talking about, like, have you ever been to dance recitals?  Like, we had to do some fucked up shit when we were young kids, like dress up and do that in the black and do they might be addicted to love and like leotards and red lipstick. And I was little doing these dances. And JonBenet.  That's it. That's a whole fucking weird world.  Joey Diaz and I were down 13. We were staying at this hotel. We were doing the absolute improvisation at this hotel where they had one of those things going on in the hotel.  So there was a child beauty pageant there, too.  We heard it was fucking bizarre wanting to see it on TV, but to see five year olds in pumps with full makeup blown out here, that movie starts with sex.  Right out of the opening scene is sex. I saw what I was like. I rented it from the library, the library when I was in like seventh grade. Sixth grade. Right. Right, right. NiÃ±os. It seemed like it. Yeah, this is. I mean, that's right, this stuff is in our culture already.  That's and I think that's more for society and whatever kind of shit with little kids and those baby beauty pageants.  Yes. Like that. Whoever greenlit that, who's like.  Yeah, looks good. Short skirt. Stick your ass out. Nice big one. High heels.  Yeah. Go hear it. And said yes.  So that's that's my I guess my point is not necessarily my feelings about couture. Just from what I've seen. I'm like, no, but I also think that this is in our culture and we need to examine that. That that that's like the beauty pageants and the right, you know, and it's funny because of you like, oh, Kuhnen is crazy.  Not everything is about pedophilia. And then your cuties, you know, prevue and you're like, oh, hey, maybe there are tunnels under what what is it?  My friend said she's like my brother said, there are tunnels, there are tunnels under the getthere some shit for human trafficking.  I don't think that's true. But but there was a fake island. Yeah. That was real. Yeah. The fact that prominent politicians well they went twenty six times.  Nine times. Wow. You do a really great impression.  There's another fucking island, North Fox Island. Oh I was never there in the 70s. Oh really. Well there was a darker way.  Darker story. Oh God. Oh wait. Darker. How can it get darker than Eppstein.  I had to like videotapes and that's what. Have you seen the documentary well, with Eppstein killed himself, case closed as far as I'm concerned. Wow, you really do a great impression. I was watching the documentary at a nice place.  You know, the fucked up realization I had watching that documentary is that I would have been one of Epstein's girl. Oh, right. I was a fucked up 17 year old doing drugs.  What does this say, agent? Jeffrey Epstein was accused of sex trafficking young girls on his mysterious private island over 40 years ago, a different millionaire escape justice in a stunningly similar case.  I you know, I had a conversation with Eric Weinstein about this and he had a very, I think, accurate.  Perception of it, he said, I believe there are people who helped curate experiences for high profile people who can't get these on their own because it's too dangerous and then someone comes along and normalizes it.  And that seems from everything from years ago how we like this person. In Epstein's case, maybe they were telling people something that was really it dressed up like that.  Well, that was the accusation that who was the prosecutor that had to release him because he was told a little boy, if I constantly was told it was above his pay grade and that this man was intelligence. And so he he had to let him go because it was a part of the intelligence community.  So someone told him to let this guy go. What? Yeah. And so when when he got arrested the first time, he got a ridiculous sentence where he's allowed to go back to his house. Right.  Had to be in jail during the day. Oh yeah.  He could be in jail at night and then had to be at his house during the day because he was working so.  That's right, Sacha Baron Cohen says he turned over disturbing who is America footage to the FBI. Cohen says his show nearly helped the FBI expose a pedophile ring in Las Vegas.  Yeah, someone was saying, look, we can we can help you.  We can. Oh, God. And this is what's terrifying. What's terrifying is that if if if there can be an island that is literally curated and run by an intelligence agent who's bringing in prominent celebrities and politicians and even scientists from all over the world to this place where they're having sex with underage girls, and we all know about it, and then the guy gets killed. And then he just hung himself. Oh, he hung himself. Yeah. And then you had Michael Baden, who's a famous autopsy doctor, says, no, these these injuries are inconsistent with that.  And they're very consistent with someone being strangled.  The position that is these choke down, it's not where someone has ligature marks. If they all all the things that point to the fact that he was murdered and months later, anyway, whatever.  Hey, it's all on 24 hour news.  Donald Trump is a bad person we need to get rid of. Keeps moving. And meanwhile, Gullane, she doesn't go to she doesn't even go to trial until October. Yeah, yeah.  That it's the rest of the. Yeah. Where is the lady right now.  It's so it's so weird how it's just like she was in a house in New Hampshire waiting magically disappears by herself, chopping wood, just waiting like redoing like they arrested her in a house in New Hampshire.  She bought a house in the woods. She thought she could just be out there. Didn't even change your hairstyle. Oh, wow. How about when she was on?  They took pictures of her at in and out reading a book about CIA agents who have been killed. Oh, my gosh. Remember that. You have seen that she she had a photo shoot.  Oh, I got in and out in L.A..  Yeah, there was a photo shoot where she was still on the loose after Jeffrey Epstein was killed when she was like sending messages to people. So here she is, like clearly posing and the book. Powerful in and out commercial, by the way. People hungry? Yeah, it was pozole, you could see the book and the book was about CIA agents who been killed, where it was their.  Cute dog. Yeah, one of the pictures, there's many pictures like.  Yeah, a lot of terrible Photoshop. Where is there? Oh, look at that. When this was taken at a time like. Right. There, that would have been like this, companies that had never actually had that posted there, but that looks like. No, this was like this came out two years ago. Wow.  So where's what is that in the lower right hand corner? Is that showing what the book is, where the arrows are pointing? That one right there. Oh, that's where she sat there doing where's the book providing experience. OK, so messed up so bad. I mean, I was I had to stop watching the documentary because it's so it's it's as dark as it gets.  How about when Trump when they asked Trump about it is like a wish her. Well, I wish you good luck. Very unfortunate.  What are you talking about. Are you saying you you wish the the lady who's accused of sex trafficking underage girls, you wish her luck and wish you well.  All these guys are all of them that like level of being is so gross.  I feel like everyone in that fucking circle is disgusting when I think back then you could be disgusting and there wasn't any consequences for it.  You know, when you think of what it must have been like to be a politician, like in the Kennedy days.  Right. I just open Lane and just, you know, go down the road. He does anything he tells you to stop.  Now, you can do whatever you want to get your dick sucked in the in the pool. Yeah, you could do that while people watching.  Yeah. No one cares. Yeah. Now it's crazy.  Like the press would not talk about his affairs that they all knew. Yeah.  It was like how amazing. Yeah. What a strange shifting of attitudes.  And how did that ever exist in the first place. If you're the press and literally your, your whole job is to tell stories and you've got this crazy story that you keep it under wraps.  I see it all the time though. I see it all the time.  But the Kennedy thing wasn't even a good cover. I remember when Marilyn Monroe sang at his birthday party. Yeah, but every time someone gets me to everyone's like I still we knew about and whatever. And I don't know if it's just industries protect their own or if they're like everyone in the industry is like, I kind of knew that was coming.  You know, you'll hear like these stories of, oh, so you could I just feel like way it might be like politicians, they protect each other. I feel like in every industry, whenever somebody gets outed, there's like there's some sense of like, uh, maybe maybe.  Yeah, maybe more than I thought there was.  Well, when the kenneled sleuthing to figure out what's really fascinating is if you apply that same logic and that's like that is assassination.  This photo was one day at a time. There's so many conspiracy theories. Yeah. Because, you know, the intelligence community really disagree with where that would have been like this. You don't think they could have got away with it? Yes.  Fucking people left and right documentary with that documented. Why that document? That's the problem. I have not just him. A lot of people back then.  Yeah, MLK, there was a whole thing written about him the other day.  Yeah. But this, this idea that they could have never gotten away with this murder because people would have talked like, you know, people didn't talk about anything.  Of course they could have got away with his murder and especially if you think they're going to kill you. And then if you go and look at how many people who are witnesses who did wind up dying and really suspicious ways, it's fucking bonkers.  Yeah. Yeah. People that were there for the Kennedy assassination that wound up dying.  It's nuts. Yeah, it's nuts. How many of them, like, committed suicide, parked their car in front of a train, like all that kind of shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that there's the whole world was dark back then. It was dark. I think it's always been dark. Yeah.  But I mean I think like this whole sex trafficking thing, this seedy underbelly of the world thing, I think back then it was way worse and I think was no way of exposing it.  Well, yeah, they all just got whacked, I think.  Yeah, I think it was like a normal it was probably like when you think of things like Skull and Bones and all these weird little clubs in these secret societies.  I remember when Kennedy here that Kennedy speech about secret societies.  No. Oh, my God. He talked about our secret societies are repugnant. This is before he was murdered. You know, Kennedy was like, yeah. Against like the CIA and the NSA and all this, and he made this public speech about secret societies, what does to say the president in the press address for the American newspaper, you can play that game.  You play it because it's really powerful to hear his voice and to know that he's gone. Yes.  Well, listen, there's a lot of reasons to think that he was probably killed by the intelligence community. Oh, that's us.  We talked about it already.  Up you can go watch Episode fourteen hundred with Tony Hinchcliffe.  Yeah, I had the Golden Pony. It's a it's a here.  Listen to that, though. It's it's very bizarre. It's a very bizarre statement because of why think about it today. Well, gentlemen. The very word secrecy is repugnant in a free and open society there, and we are as a people, inherently and historically opposed to secret societies, to secret oaths and to secret proceedings. We decided long ago that the dangers of excessive and unwarranted concealment of pertinent facts far outweigh the dangers which are cited to justify it.  Even today, there is little value in opposing the threat of a closed society by imitating its arbitrary restrictions. Even today, there is little value in ensuring the survival of our nation if our traditions do not survive with it. Wow. And there is very grave danger that an announced need for increased security will be seized upon by those anxious to expand its meaning. Wow. To the very limits of official censorship and concealment.  Dude, he's trying to warn us. He's trying to warn us about exactly what's Hatriot Act Patriot Act to China. Edward Snowden hiding in Russia, trying to warn us.  He really was. Yeah, he really was. We didn't listen.  They killed them and we did listen. We listened. We know now to shut our fucking mouth. Yeah. We're both going to be dead in 24 hours. Get away with more shit back then, just like everybody else. Yeah.  I mean, it's a it's a weird time because some some of the stuff, you know, I have very conflicting feelings about some of the stuff.  That comes out, I think it's good that a lot of lights being shined on it, I also hate that people don't get due process.  So there's like a very strange we live in a very strange time for this where great more stuff is being revealed, although we seem to forget the stuff that's actually proven like Eppstein in five minutes. And then there's stuff that's not, you know, people are being destroyed and have no no access to due process or anything and even and there's no way to defend themselves.  The stunning thing about the interesting thing is that the mainstream media has let it go.  Yeah, completely. You would think that. And they barely even really covered it. It wasn't even something that I too. It's almost like they covered it.  Like there was a story mentioned. Yeah. But they had to they had to mention it. Otherwise they'd be complicit.  Yeah. Yeah. It's a it's a weird that seems like it should be a way bigger deal and be much more covered and investigated. And thank God for those amazing reporters down in Florida who did all that investigative journalism. The woman I can't remember her name, but she she's really responsible for like staying on that beat. And I just I, I think this is why I feel even in L.A. during the riots, like the local journalism was amazing. They were doing great work.  They were on the ground. They were interviewing people in real time. And part of the reason I see so I hate all the division and all of that. It's like that death of local journalism, which has contributed to so much of just nobody really knows anything.  Well, that's what I've been real forgiving of, people writing click Baity articles. Yeah. And one of the reason why I tell people like journalists are fighting for their life right now. Yeah. Yeah. There are very important to me. It's very important to me that there's people that are willing to get the word out. Yeah. And they're willing to explain what's happening. And some of them are forced to write some bullshit articles with click Baity titles because they have to stay alive because no one is buying newspapers.  No, and it's it's not generally it's usually a calling. I think my true journalists are usually called to do it.  They can't let go of a story. They want to find my biggest again, this is another weird issue place where we're in, as I call it, journalism.  And it's activism. Masking is journalism.  And I and that is where I feel like the the press is this is where they're losing their credibility because they're not being honest.  Why there's no one. Well, there are some, but there's very few who are unbiased. Just telling you they're mostly working in local journalism at rags that are being canceled, bought out, bought up by bigger things. And and so you have the people who are kind of activists and they're journalists are practicing journalism. And that's damaging to all journalists because now you're undermining what your job is to do, which is present facts. Yes. And present evidence and present and chase down leads and not have your own opinion about things.  Have, you know, discover something as more evidence is presented to you and always be checking yourself?  Well, my hope is that through this, independent sources will emerge. What you're seeing that with some independent political sources like you're seeing, like whether it's the Jimmy Dorje Show or Kolinsky or rising on the Hill, all these people that are not beholden to any one party. Yeah, they're talking about politics. I'm hoping we're going to see that with everything. Yeah. And that these these people with these biased perceptions and, you know, journalism, as you call it, which is a great word that they're they're going to because of their own faults, open the door for independent people that are not connected with.  Yes, they do have a calling, but that recognize that there's a real you're hindered if you're connected to some machine.  I think this is why people are so confused right now and lost. And I hear this from these letters.  I'm getting letters from the politically homeless and they're say what happens a lot is they'll get read pulled by the mainstream media. They recognize, I think, mouse talks a lot about this and just recognizing the idea of the kid. Yeah, he's great. Brilliant.  And just the idea of the cathedral, that isn't his idea. And I can't remember who he always attributed to and realizing there's a narrative and there's an agenda that's being pushed. And once they open their eyes and see that, they'll it's there's not much of a stop on the way to. And now why isn't Biden fighting against Petawawa?  You know, they're like you're just like you. Suddenly you're like mainlining you've gone from taking a red, felt like snorting, them mainlining.  And now you're kuhnen.  Yeah. Because out here, these people who are start out very reasonable, like, oh, the left got crazy.  I got a little disillusioned. I started going down the rabbit hole.  And then there's really not much because people don't know what to believe. All of the confusion. Oh, you can protest. You can't protest, you can wear masks, you can't wear masks, that there's no credibility, every system and this is generally in societies when you see this kind of breakdown of society, is when people lose faith in the people who are governing them, the experts, you know, you have epidemiologists who are like racism is the real the real virus.  That's not the way viruses work.  You know, when you're when you're saying these things to me as a scientist, how are you expecting people to take you seriously when they've stopped their fucking lives for you?  Did you see what the the U.N. quote was about the pandemic that revealed that the patriarchy is now gigantic problem?  Yeah.  And then you're blaming it on the patriarchy and you have all of these these institutions that are falling in line with us.  So people are they're stumbling in the wilderness and then they're online and then the virtue signalling and then they're there in these echo chambers and then they're going towards anybody who disagrees and then they're demanding compliance.  But it's easy for to people. The thing that concerns me is if you are a person, you know, I have to check in with myself when I'm like, if I feel like I'm saying, fuck you, I'm voting for Trump like that is that is being radicalized. You know, that is the process of radicalization happening. I understand it. It's it's something that a lot of people doing it, but it's completely emotional. If you're like this is some for some people it's not.  Some people think that, well, yeah, that's more dangerous than anything. Is woak politics. Yeah. Yeah, that's pool is like the media's lying to us.  They're they're gaslighting us.  And I think that this whole WOAK bullshit is more dangerous than anything.  Now he's gone like full magga and wow. But see that that is something that I would check in with myself about because if you were here and now you're here, I understand.  And I think this is why we live in one of the most interesting times in American history ever, because there's so much migration, literal migration. You sitting here is a perfect example of that.  And political migration. Ideological migration. My inbox is evidence of this. People from the center going left or right, people from the right coming left, people from the left coming right. It's fast.  I mean, it's that easy for. Yes. Hundreds of years if we have a future. You're totally right. You're totally right. It's just a fascinating time in our in our history. And I think that people we have to give each other space to re realign a little bit.  But what is worrisome to me is in the absence of anyone to trust so journalism journalists, many journalists have abdicated their role. Many politicians are well, they're all just shit, basically sending a populist message to the people.  Like I don't understand the worship at all that in the absence of all of this, where do people turn?  You know, they're turning to people like you, for instance, because you're willing to have conversations with many different kinds of people, of course, across the spectrum so they can maybe, you know, in order to read the news now, I'll see I'll see a headline. If it confirms my bias, I'm like, I better double check that, you know? Yes, I immediately am like, OK, double check that. That's because you're smart.  But this is how everyone should consume the news.  But I understand why they don't, because it's like, OK. And then I read a quote while that was now I have to go listen to the whole OK, that was completely taken out of context. Now they're citing a study. Now I have to go read the fucking study I have.  I end up with all this, go to all the source material. Yeah. You have to just go to the source material always.  But that takes it'll take me an hour to read one article and figure out like what's actually true. And that article. Yeah, no one has that time. It's easier to be like I hate this exactly bad.  Yeah. That's, that's what most people do. They find something that confirms their bias and then they read only those things that that exist in their little echo chamber.  But you should be seeking things that, you know, push against your bias.  I was having a conversation with a person, a person, a friend of mine or some friend of mine who has witnessed so the unhappy and I was like a horror movie.  She was asking me about UFOs. And I said, my main problem with UFOs is that I want to believe. Yeah, I mean, my main problem with all this evidence, like it seems real, it seems real seems about the problem is I want to believe. Right.  And whenever I want something to be real, go probably double check that. Yeah.  Yeah. You have to mind. Fuck yourself. Yeah, yeah, yeah. That's the right way to that's how you can avoid making an ass out of yourself online and sharing something that's not real. Like pretty much video. I will not share it. I see so much video getting shared by people who are independent journalists.  That is cut weird. It's edited weird. It's. Not true, you end up and they're, you know, people everybody on the Internet. I always make fun of the sun dumpster fire like everyone's I hate this new season of law and order where there's a murder every day in real time. And then the Internet is like a sleuth figuring it out. They're like breaking it down frame by frame. See this like thanks guys. Like the police on the ground and detectives probably have this handled.  Thank you for your well.  Sometimes, though, they do find people like that guy before he did the interview with Vice and Exposed that he is the one who killed the magazine reporter.  Yeah, they found him.  They found him because of a tattoo on his neck and they had identified him, people just Randle's that were like looking at this online sleuthing.  Actually, they actually know that.  I believe that there's some use in that. But it just seems like there's also probably more misinformation that could spread that way than actual facts. Yeah, and it's that old quote, like the lie spreads faster than the truth, you know, around the world before the truth gets out of bed or whatever the lie, a lie will go around the world before the truth gets out of bed. That's true. True. And then this kind of environment and then everybody is ALV, you know, the Russian troll farms and Chinese for Russian logging.  And at nine a.m.. Oh, my God, it's madness. I love it. And I don't know where it where it ends. There's no map of the territory at this point, but it starts with us.  That's what I'm saying. It starts with the individual. It starts with people recognizing that they're biased. Right. Learning to consume news in a more intelligent way. That's reasonable checking, fact checking thing.  And it starts even before that with improving yourself. Yes. Getting control over who you are.  Like, think of what you've done, overcoming hypochondria, kicking drugs and all the craziness that you've gotten through. Yeah. That's what's led you to be this critical thinker that you are today and this strong person.  The problem is we're asking people to be strong when they're not. We're asking people who are there right now who they are is not capable of doing these things.  We're asking them to do. Why?  Because of all the experiences they've had in their life. That's no excuse. But no, no, no, it is not an excuse, but it is a fact like who they are is they're so accustomed to behaving and thinking in a certain way that takes a radical shift to rethink this. And they can they can do that. They can act in that way and rethink the way they live their life. But they have to be severely motivated. Right.  To change is so hard. Well, and then there's so much, you know, so say you are so radically shift your ideology online. And I've I've experienced this just not in shifting my ideology, just not censoring. Then you get swept up with all the likes from you get it's reinforced with dopamine of like, oh, if I say this thing, this thing does well. Yeah. And that's again asking a lot for people to work against. You have to actively be like, OK, now what am I not saying again, because I'm worried I might piss off my new audience who's embraced me.  You know, I would ask anybody who's gone from the left to Foley to the right, like, what are you not saying now about things that you're noticing on your new team that you join?  A weird thing when people do completely as a grown adult shift their ideology.  I'm always like, oh, did you oh, did you or were you always wishy washy?  We always full of shit, you know? And to be rigid one way or the other is just so strange.  Yeah, it's so strange. Yeah. I guess I, I, I can attribute my shift to paying attention and being thrown into the culture war and I don't even feel like my actual values have changed so much as the culture has changed around me. Yeah. Most of what I believe about free speech, you know. Right. The the right to have jobs and work how you want to, which I push back against all the time in California what they're doing there.  And well, they had you know, they fight that gig society. Maybe if I told you about it the last time I was here, they had a fight with it about stand up comics. They were going to try and include stand up comedy at the Comedy Store. Actually was the head of that. Yeah. Yeah. They actually fought and won and got comics reclassified. But there was an issue where certain people were not going to get booked because these arenas.  Yeah, these venues, rather, we're going to have to employ them.  Yeah. And like we can't afford to give you health insurance. You do a fucking stupid one woman show here.  There's trying to pass a national version of this called the Pro Act. And this is trying to do this. The Democrats there already passed the House.  That's so crazy there. And it's essentially would categorize independent contracting and it would give it the same label that it has in California.  That's why you write articles for a bunch of different publications. You'd have to be an employee of each one to join a union.  That's what they want. It's like you're either going to have to join a union, you're going to have to work for the government or join a union or go get a. But people were Georg's, you know, most people are adults, they can understand the cost benefit analysis that they're making.  They can say, I might not have great health insurance, but I have the freedom to work as an Uber driver when I want to. I can log in when I want to. I can clock out. I can take an hour break. I can do whatever the fuck I want on my time. And I understood when I was waitressing that I could have gone and got what worked in a corporation. I could have probably gone and got a job anywhere and had good benefits and I would have had to clock in at a certain time and clock out and probably play the game and not say things that I want to say.  And I understood that I would have to take a riskier path and I took responsibility for that.  Now, I think that some of these companies do need to be held accountable in terms of how they treat their workers, how much they pay them, how much they pay their workers.  And it is true, I don't I'm not here to defend Uber because they do. I mean, even just talk to any Uber drivers. They've, you know, lowered their rates and it's harder for them to make money. And it's all so they're not exactly perfect.  But you can't take agency away from people who are choosing to work as a gay person and and not maybe join a union or go work at a job. And this is why I can't you know, this is something that people should be calling Biden out on because he's come out many times in support of this.  Do you know how gross he would be if comedians had a union? Disgusting. Could you imagine? Oh, fuckwit would be in control of that union.  And how many shitty comics would go to the head of that union? Yeah, because they don't have any power or agency in their comedy career.  Yes.  They get a huge H.R. department, the worst comics with the shittiest ideas of what constitutes comedy. Yeah. And they would probably start censoring people. Yeah.  All of it is we should be able to work where we want and how we want that, especially someone like you want to write for a bunch of different.  Like all of a sudden you'd have to be in a union and pay dues while people. So one of the women that I'm friends with had to leave L.A. because in many single this and it always hurts the people they say they're trying to help. She was a single mom and she had you can't work. You couldn't write more than like thirty articles a month. Most people who are freelance are writing thirty articles a week if they can, you know, they're cranking these things out in there.  And if you are a company, for instance, you now have to employ that person. And so companies based in D.C., if you're writing for a political whatever it might be, they were saying we can't work with you because you we would have to fall under the laws of firing.  Either hire you or that's it. And we're not going to hire you.  This is a perfect example of where you can be fiscally conservative and socially liberal. Right. And you don't have to agree with you don't have to, like, uniformly agree with everything that's on your side. And this is this is one of those this is a conservative viewpoint that I completely agree with. Give people freedom. Yes.  Especially with what we do, whether it's a comic or a writer. Yeah. Do both. But that kind of shit is crazy. The idea that you would have to be like forcing people to join unions is insane.  Yeah. And if you really I encourage people to read the pro act bell and to try and figure it out again, go to the source material.  Don't just listen to me go research this stuff. There's some stuff that I think most people are like, OK, that's a little reasonable.  But the problem with these bills is that they try and cram in as much crap as they possibly can. And so you there is it would make it so that you could there's it's just it's very pro union.  And I, again, don't have anything against unions, but they shouldn't have all of the power, you know, shouldn't you shouldn't be forced to join a union in order to work as a comedian or a freelance writer. And it hurt so many people.  I heard sign language people who do translations and hurt people who work as independent drivers, you know, personal assistants like that.  It was an endless there's a whole website devoted to stories from people from hundreds of different.  Why did they pass it? Because the woman who did is an insane person. I mean, I think it's part of the reason that Ellen's probably going to bounce out of there, too, because I don't know that he uses you.  I'm not sure. But I'm not sure that he uses union people in his factories. I could be wrong about that. But I know that part of her beef was with Elon and Uber and these big corporations. But when you look at who's funding her, which I love doing, is following the money of all these people. It's like all the labor unions.  So she's in the pockets of these people and she she will post something and then people will be in her mentions like, please don't do this. You're hurting us. You're hurting us. You're hurting your constituents. Her name's Lorena Gonzalez. You're hurting, and she'll just take her. Her the ability for anybody to reply to her, I'm like, what kind of fucking representative are you that you are saying, I'm helping people?  Your people are like, you're hurting us. And she's like, mutes, replies. Like, you actually don't care about your people. You're just posturing and saying that you do.  And in fact, you're just in the pocket of unions and pushing a bill that most everyone in the state I mean, Uber and Lyft, we're going to leave California not like leave take their headquarters like no Uber or Lyft in California because they couldn't comply with the whole freaking business model of Uber is independent contractors and left.  That's the business. That is the business model. That was the whole plan. That's the whole thing. The deal. And you're trying to say, no, you need to employ these people.  What does California look like in 10 years? How is it going to be Mad Max?  It feels like Mad Max already. A little. I mean, does a little person. Yeah, it's just it's so it's so it's heartbreaking what's happening to some of the cities.  It just I believe that there will be a resurgence. I think whenever the cities empty out, artists move in and weirdos and they're like, whoo! Opportunity. So I, I believe in the creative, especially in New York. It's like people are like New York is that I'm I guess it's not that you know that. Well, I hope they're right.  I hope so too. But people still live there in the 70s, even though it's violent.  And I think L.A. has more problems in New York. Does is just one earthquake away from being a dead man's land?  Yeah, no, I don't want to be there for that, because if the earthquake hits, you think there's a mass exodus now? Yeah. Yeah. The mass exodus now is about freedom. Yeah, that's most of it. It's about freedom. And then the worry about taxes because they're talking about raising taxes. They just I think that fell.  That didn't I could be wrong, but I'm pretty sure that that even that was too crazy for California, that it was that the wealth tax, they were thinking about the wealth tax and then, oh, I don't know, the wealth tax is something they were going to they that died.  Yeah, that was the most ridiculous proposal of all time.  Is it the same tax, the California tax is like if you make over four hundred thousand dollars a year, that's under it, nothing will change. Tax the wealth tax, the wealthiest over 400 wasn't the thing about the California one.  Peter Schiff talked about it.  It's it's so it was so crazy that 10 years ago, if you'd left 10 years ago, you'd have money.  And then, yeah, if you leave now from 10 years on, they could get money from you. Yeah. So if you leave today, you owe money for ten more years. It's so ridiculous. How do you even enforce that. Just criminals.  You're stealing. Dealers you're stealing. Yeah. It's shameless stealing.  And you know the idea Tim Kennedy was on the here it is. If you make under 400000 years, Joe Biden, you will not. By the way, he didn't write this. You will not pay a penny more in taxes. When I'm president, the super wealthy and big corporations will finally pay their fair share and we'll invest the money in working families. We're going to reward work, not wealth, not know.  Here's the thing that drives me crazy. Where the biggest wealth this I believe it's California that has the most wealth inequality in America.  They have done nothing to help the middle class. They've eaten the middle class completely. All my friends who are my and my age are a little younger in their 30s.  They all had to leave and go buy a house and they left years ago because they're like, it's too expensive for us to try and get ahead and have kids and these mom and pops that are getting destroyed.  Nobody they don't give a shit about the middle class or the working class.  And so every you're seeing tons of homeless people are on houses and tons of people who are absolutely loaded.  I can't wear it. How am I going? You know, how much money it would take for me to buy a house in L.A. for a down payment in my neighborhood?  Thirteen hundred thirteen hundred square feet.  Two hundred and fifty thousand dollars like a quarter of a million. You're looking at me like that's not that much money.  You're like, what's the problem with.  It's a lot of fucking money. Yeah, it's not. I get it.  There's a detached but I'm not detached. There's, I still understand it. There's no pathway upward for the middle class and places like New York, don't you think?  Well, let's get really big, though. It's almost they're unmanageable when they get really big and they're always when they're really big, they're always run by Democrats.  Yeah, they're really big. Cities are always Democrat run for whatever strange reason.  I mean, Detroit's a good example of what happened. You know, that was a thriving city. Yeah.  But that was different because then that was when they shifted the. Yeah, that.  Yeah.  And there's no Detroit was one of the richest cities in the world. Yeah. Yeah. They fucked up globalization. Yeah.  I mean that was one of Michael Moore's best movies was about Flint. Oh yeah. I know about Flint Michigan. Was it called Biden. Sorry about that was his first movie.  The big movie The Coming Out. It's Michael Moore.  Make over for the climate. Roger, Roger and me, like under Roger. Roger. Yeah. It was all about the guy who was the head of GM that what it was.  He was trying to contact him to figure out why moving jobs out of the city. And do you understand what you're doing to this place? And that was when he was a real populist.  Yeah.  You know, and it's funny how he became a villain when he had this movie criticizing the industry of climate change, the industry behind climate change. There was a you piece of shit.  I thought I was one of your guys. Everyone's canceled.  I know everything's canceled. It's when we were driving around in our tour guide, our little Sherpa who is showing us around, he he was like showing us all these amazing little all the awesome places that are closed because of covid will probably never open. And they've been there since like nineteen thirty eight and all that. And you know, we were saying like if I was a philanthropic billionaire I would buy all these little mom and pops and help keep them alive because they're the lifeblood of these cities.  And they're also just that. That's what kills me, is like I hate seeing this this coffee shop that's been there since forever closed and there's a Starbucks next door and like, they're fine, but it just kills that.  That is where I want. Austin is all about these little small independent places. Yeah. Restaurants, independent businesses. It's one of the things that I really love about it. Yeah. That's one of the things that attracted me to this place in the first place. I'm hoping that new ones will rise and take their place. That's that's the hope is that the ethic of this community, we need a more robust middle class, you know, if that's what we need to cultivate in California, if you want to try and fix California, that's where you start.  How do you help people who are living in the one hundred to six hundred thousand dollar a year range or even less sixty thousand? Because you what is their pathway up, especially now. Yeah. How do you how how do you help them.  Because that's where, that's where that's what, what holds the center.  It wants to run for president again. You've got mail dumps.  Maybe we should both run. No. Hey. Yeah. No, no. That's probably your veep. No, no. I'll support you. I don't want to be president, I give you have to be first woman president. Kamala Harris would be the first woman president if Joe Biden wins the timber's because he ain't going to make it with the Timberland's.  All right. We did three hours. We said. Oh, really? Wow. Sorry for past four. Sorry. It was awesome. I enjoyed it. That was a fun one going to move here.  I am definitely considering it.  I don't like to be a follower, not a follower of a follower.  It feels so lame, though. Why? Because I got here first. No, no. Just because I'm generally everybody's leaving and I'm generally and I want our stuff. I just don't know where I want to go. It's better. Maybe I'll go to Idaho. That's good. But they'll get mad.  If you talk about now, shout out to Boise. All right. Dumpster fire. It's available on YouTube.
