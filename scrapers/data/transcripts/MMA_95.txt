My guest today is one of my best friends is former UFC heavyweight contender who now hosts The Fighter in the Kid podcast with my brother Brian Cowan. He hosts Below the Belt on Showtime and the Below the Belt podcast. He's fucking awesome. And we got together today to talk about the UFC, this upcoming event this weekend and to talk a whole lot of shit.  It was maybe 20 percent UFC talk that accurate, Jamie? That's fair. Jamie says, please give it up for my brother, Mr. Brennan Schwabe. Fight week, it's here, dude, it's here, we're just a couple of days away. Here we are Thursday. We got Friday and then Saturday's fights and I got to go. I'm going to be in Jacksonville, Florida. I'm going to be doing commentary in an empty arena. No one's going to be near me.  Everybody has to be really far away from each other. We're going to be on separate corners of the octagon, which is which fucking sucks you, DC and Hanneke.  And then is when things go crazy, D.C. always grab each other like you guys vibe off of each other.  Can't do that. Everybody's a pussy, but we're all tested. That's what doesn't make any sense. I'm saying if you all agree, like, we'll risk it memorable. We're all healthy. We're all fine.  Well, not only are we all healthy and find we're tested, we're for clean, we don't have it. It's like we don't have to be far apart from each other.  I got tested yesterday. I got the results back from my nose swab. That's negative. And then two days before that, I took an antibody test. That's negative, too. I'm 100 percent negative.  So whose idea is this? It's fucked in the state. The state just has real rigid guidelines. Apparently they just want to make sure that everybody safe campaigns wanted to come with me. He couldn't come from anybody came in. Nope.  Do you know what can we do to covid? It doesn't have a chance. So of that kind of cardio God. Come on, man.  Listen, I had Elon on the podcast yesterday and we talked about what the actual death rate is versus what everyone thought it was going to be.  Is he good at reading stuff?  He said it's a magnitude of 10 to 50 percent, ten to fifty times less deadly than they thought it was going to be. That's pretty big, that's huge, especially when they start getting to things like, I don't know if you've seen the there's a prison where they tested these prisoners, 90 percent of them had it and had no idea.  Asymptomatic. Yeah, everybody was fine. Yeah. They're finding that in a lot of places. A lot of people are asymptomatic.  And Elan goes hard in the paint, too. Yeah, he goes hard in the paint, which I love.  He said you if you got bit by a shark and died and you had covid, they would count as a covert death.  Yeah, 100 percent. I mean, he's making a joke. He is, but he's not. Yeah, but he's not. Yeah. Yeah he's not. Yeah.  It's so it's so ridiculous.  When did we find out whether or not that's true about the heart attacks, the heart disease. Because someone else brought it up to me today. Someone else who's a pretty smart person in New York.  I looked like I couldn't even find the numbers. So I don't know where they got those numbers. Steve, there's an article that cites art. I looked hard. Is the pod the pod cast out? I looked hard. So the pod cast out. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So does he mention how is it weird that the the death rate went down once the flu season's over?  Did you talk about the accountant flu covid too. Yeah, that's the thing.  If you have flu and covered the candidates covid. Yeah.  And then the flu, you know, look, corvids not good, but it's not what we were worried about.  It's not what we thought it was going to to shut down the economy. No, I don't think so. I think shutting it down for a couple of weeks is not a bad idea to get a sense of it. But once the numbers are back, I mean, I think right now it needs to restart. People need to be precautious. They need to follow social distancing guidelines where massive possible, especially until we get it all wrapped up and figure out what it is in terms of like what the treatment like what does that sort of your remedies of remedies, evere, this new antiviral treatment that they say is supposed to work, working really well with it?  I think you have underlying health conditions. Yes. And you're over 60 put on a mask. If you don't, it should be up to me if I want to wear it.  Did you know that the average age of covid death users, people who get covid and die is higher than the average age of death?  That's nuts. That's nuts. I'm so glad Elon came on. Is that a crazy strike? Some fucking not so crazy. No. Yeah, it's great.  And there's this weird, like, toxic culture who wants to be bad. So when he wants spit these facts, I'm sure your podcast comes out. People like know and they start throwing other facts like these are the stats.  Yeah, it's tough to argue these hard, cold facts. People are so scared. Well, you want to know Doctor again.  Save it, dude. Yeah, we're looking at stats. Yeah. I think you can read stats. Yeah. That doesn't get us to the fucking tomorrow so you can build a fucking planet. You know, I think we, I think we would be all right. You can read those.  I mean listen to that guy. Yeah. It's not what we thought it was going to be. That's what it is. Everybody was scared two months ago. I was like, holy shit, the plagues coming. And it's not that it's not that we got lucky. It's a bad cold. It's really bad. Kill some people. It fucks people up with respiratory disease. It's really bad for people that are obese. It's really bad for old.  Everything's bad for old people. Obese people, though, everything's bad.  That's that's reality. That's giving shape, man. God damn it. Say it.  Say it back in shape. Join the boys bike club and get your fat ass in, bro.  How many fucking rattlesnakes are in your neighborhood every day? You're sending me a video of a new rattlesnake.  That's ridiculous. And that's that's like that dirt Mahorn Road and the Topanga Canyon, like that's those dirt roads. And they're if they go on the road, they go on the run, they go in the sun.  Oh. And now I'm just I don't accustom to I used to be so scared to buy in the morning my car and we go home and be so scared but now it's like they're not going to bother me.  I mean if I, if I step on one, it's, you know, it's give me trouble. But I'd still rather get I'd rather get cold than you be rattlesnake do that right now. One hundred, one hundred percent. 100 percent.  But you, they look like these big logs that Mike Posner got. He got bit by Roulston fucked up as a baby one.  Yeah. It's stronger than him I guess. No, that's a myth apparently. Yeah. Well, all right. Well they all suck. It didn't baby.  Do you see the one I seen today? How about that bedbug who's a little aggressive, too. A little big, a little aggressive. And then he started my way. Do come on. Don't try and make noise like. Come on, dude, go that way, man. Every morning I see you every morning.  You know, their venom, apparently it's like it digests the animal. Like if they kill a rabbit with their venom, it actually helps digest the rabbit. It breaks down the tissue. So when people get bit by it, it makes your skin rot. It makes your meat rot. So it allowed like so if it was going to swallow you, it allows it to digest you easier.  I think my be. Yes, OK. I think I'll be all right. But it's going to be such a locked up man.  You can get fucked up a rattlesnake, such a nightmare. I watched this horrible fucking website where they had a series of photographs of this guy that got bit on the arm and they had a medevac them out of there and they had to do a bunch of procedures, skin games. And all kinds of shit, and his arm was fucked up, was like it rotted a hole through his arm. Did you watch that thing I sent you about Alex Smith, the quarterback?  Did you see?  I started watching it and it was gross. It didn't really mean he had some flesh eating bacteria in his leg was a compound fracture. I was playing for the Redskins, did take muscle from his left leg and put in the right leg.  It's just a nightmare. I probably would have amputated it.  Why are you still under contract? Is it going to try to play again?  I mean, that's how it was so bad, where they're like, you're not going to have motion in your foot.  And most of the when we see these kind of injuries, it's usually soldiers from stepping on IEDs or whatever. So most times they just amputated your legs. Never going to be the same. Otherwise you're looking at 18 month. You know, you're in this cast with braces and screws into the muscle and the bone. You're looking at that long leg. And even after then, you're like a motion your foot. I'd like to just take it off. Give me that fucking cool RoboCup carbon fiber one.  Toss some special stickers on that bitch get sponsored by the Circuit City.  They're changing like every year.  They're changing what they can and can't do in terms of like biologicals, like stem cells and different treatments they come up with. You know, they can fix ECLSS now without using anything other than your ACL, UNAM. Yeah, Dr. Rodney McGee was showing me these videos of this guy who they did it to, and then he went into the Olympics four months after surgery. That's pretty gangster. It's crazy. They're blowing out their ECLSS, right. The ACL snaps, which was game over back in the day.  Yeah, well, used to be they had to replace it either with a patella tendon graft, hamstring graft or a clapper. Yeah, I've had a patella tendon graft on the left and a cadaver on my right. But this thing now they're taking the actual ACL. It exists and they have some new way of suturing it and they squirt some stem cells up in there and it heals on. You're good to go. Yeah, it heals up. Jesus Christ.  Yeah, it's pretty crazy. So my thought is that they're always coming up with new ways to cut you off.  Don't cut your head off just for sticker's just to get swats. You know, my thing is, is robotics coming along too. So that's come some badass with this robot lay.  My worry is one day artificial leg is going to be so good, people are going to get their good legs removed so they can get an artificial leg.  Make sense. It's going to happen. Yeah, it's going to feel like a regular leg.  You just run forever. It's like you jump over buildings and be sick.  I mean, going to become a superhero. Yeah. Six Melanda men. Remember that shit. Yeah. It's going to be way more than six million bucks, a lot more.  But Alex Smith can afford it. That's what's going to happen in the future. Probably you don't cut the leg off.  Yes. Let me get your leg after you.  Have you watched the countdown show for this this weekend's event? I watched it. Did you see the trailer that I posted?  No, I did not. Would you post?  I got emotional watching it. Well, Dana posted it and someone sent it to me. I'm like, oh, shit. I got to I got to post it. Dana has me blocked so I can't click on his profile and see.  I'm like, what the fuck is Instagram like? Oh, we're we're blocking people now.  We're throwing spin and shit. What like I don't know, probably when we got into that whole scuffle on Instagram, but that was his not mine. Was that at least two years ago. That's his doing, not mine.  I tried so hard to mend that bridge. Have had so many sit downs.  I don't get the hey, I don't get it but I love who's a beer. So it's a problem, you know, it's like I don't get it. But it's so strange. Like when you when you look at the list of people like who's a bigger advocate for the UFC, nobody. Nobody. But I mean you. Yeah. And you work for. Yeah. I don't receive a dime off of it. No. Yeah. But I shop from the rooftop.  Well you know some people they fucking dig their heels in.  Yeah. He's like Michael Jordan. He just doesn't let anything go.  Oh is this the thing to talk about. I did see this. Yeah it's great. Yeah. To be the best promo they've ever made. It's very good. The countdown show begins with this.  It's so good. It makes me so proud to be part of the UFC.  The countdown show is so good, man. The countdown show so good. And you see Justin first of all, Justin, how hilarious is just engaging he goes. I hope he breaks my nose so I can get it fixed.  Crazy because you hear him talk. He's talking. He's talking like that.  You know, his nose and his nose is useless. It's smashed. I mean, his style is so fast forward. So such a brawler in a good way, I think.  Yeah. Tacoma Brawler. I mean, I'm a hard look. I'm a giant fan of that guy. I do. I'm I'm a fan of his his personality, his mindset, the way he approaches his attitude. He's here. He's he's kill or be killed.  I think it I think this is actually a tougher fight for Tony Ferguson than it could be. But it's a scary fight for anybody.  If you're locked in the cage, just engaging. It is it is war.  It's a different fight. I'm telling you. It's like it's like Tony Ferguson was getting ready to go deep scuba diving, deep sea scuba diving. And we know you can go in the deep waters, but we know what to expect. We'll bitch, dude. But you know what to expect with Gage. It's like you're not scuba diving anymore. You're snorkeling and you're in hurricane waters. And you got to get past the initial part. And it's a mother.  Fucker. But if you get past that, you'd be all right, but good luck, man, because these waves are fucking common, dude. Yeah, he's he's a different kind of guy because he's so reckless.  He's just like he takes big chances. He doesn't play it safe at all. And the other thing is, you know, Tony gets hit.  Yeah. Yeah. He'll stand in front of you.  And you look at the Petis fight, the fight, not a fight is a really good example of that.  But I think the land of not a fight. First of all, he took it on short notice. And second of all, awkward Lento's.  Nobody knew. Lando's good. He's good. He's very awkward. Yeah, he's very awkward.  But Tony gets hit baozi early on in every fight he can hit. He wants to play that game. The Anthony Pettis one, he got warbled, you know. Yupp. Woodgate, you can't really play that game, right. Craxton He justifiably he he doesn't he just cracked is no space.  He doesn't give you any space. He jumps all over you. If he gets you hurt, Ill throw himself right into the fire. It's like he's not worried about losing. And that's real. Like people say that sometimes, but I don't think they really mean it.  That's a gift. He really means it's a gift.  Yeah, it's a real gift for him. Yeah. He's got a very unusual mindset. I don't think Tony is either, though.  That's what makes this fight so fascinating. That's why I think I love Kobe, but I want to be Tony. But this fight to me is more entertaining.  I think so, too. I think so, too.  I which just weird to say. No, I think he's more entertaining than anybody. He's so fucking wild. And then Tony's more entertaining than anybody to like everybody who fights Tony. Looks like they fell off a train.  Everybody there look at the Cowboys face was a fucking mess. So it's a mess. Patti Pettis is covered in blood. Everybody gets fucked up. There's a photograph that shows the list of the last like nine or ten people that Tony's fought. Everyone looks like they got shot in the face.  They look like Ted Bundy victims. It's crazy. It's nuts. Yeah, look at that. Look at those people. Everyone's face is just a fucking holy wreck. Everybody looks dead.  And the cardio, the Tony Furguson cardio.  That's why you got to get past that first initial wave of just engaging. But after then, Tony doesn't get tired, never gets tired.  His cardio is off the charts.  I wonder if anybody's going to shoot because they're both such phenomenal wrestlers. People forget how good Tony is that he never shoots.  He's got no real takedowns in the UFC zero zero takedown attempts, zero.  I go back and forth on picking who's going to win the fight. I you know, as far as if you want to make money, choose a good dog. But it'd be impossible up against Tony for the last eight years.  The thing is, Gaikai comes in and he does he comes in with his head lower.  Well, that snap city for Tony Ferguson, well, he starts his anaconda's.  And the the other thing is we don't really know what kind of jujitsu or jujitsu defense Kaiji has.  He hasn't been in a scramble with a real high level guy is a big unknown.  And I think that Tony is one of the trickiest submission missionaries in the sport. He's very sneaky. He catches Darcis and scrambles. He's got leg locks. He's got triangles. You tap Kevin Lee off his back with a triangle, he basically can do everything.  So I wouldn't be surprised if Tony at one point starts diving for those ankles, because if you're not sieverts and jiujitsu, that's that's where it gets dicey for guys. He's going to it is when a guy comes in, he doesn't know. Like, once you get in this rabbit hole, man, you can't keep up, especially in training.  It can't keep up. Right. And Tony has a leg like his. Yeah. Eddie bravas his coach. Yeah, he's got everything. He's got everything.  And his fucking hands are off the charts. He's so weird to like the way he moves. Tony is so creative with his striking and it's almost like he moves almost like he's breakdancer in there, you know, like he's he's fucking stepping side to side, left, right. Populist jab comes out of nowhere.  The fuck is he doing? I can't tell who would win the fight. I don't know. I can't tell you. I love it, though. I love it.  I keep doing it. I can't. I cannot.  We cannot wait. To me, this is one of the biggest U.S. fights of all time.  It's a giant card. The card is stacked is one of the most stacked cards in the history of the sport since UFC 100 from top to bottom, UFC 100.  It's there's so many great fights that people are forgetting like, oh yeah, look, Francis and Gano versus Rosen strike.  I mean, that filthy holy shit. How about Tom Cruise? So you know what? The crime was crazy and everybody's forgetting it's so good. People forgot. Got Jeremy Stevens versus Calvin Carter. That's a fucking look.  I really believe Calvin Carter is the dark horse in that division. I think he might be the champ some degree. He's got a real shot.  Yep. God damn. That's a good fight. I wish I was five round, so.  Yeah. Better in five. Well, yeah. Well, if you look at the Zambito fight, he was fucking the beat trautmann.  Yes. He might have stopped him the third round.  He was chasing him down. He was walking him down. Oh man.  So Paris Fabrício Silverdome is back. Oleynik Jesus Christ. You know what I picture is Onex team going. Yeah, dude, you got to fight is like, oh, yeah, who's getting this 10 fingered choke? Well, yeah, it's for Dhume. He's like, he's not do that. You know, boy, kind of see how much you like Inmet.  Uriah Hoffer's is Jacker Ray Carlos Esparza versus Michelle Waterson. All the shit, even the pre prelims Petis versus.  Oh my God. Look at the senti Luke versus Nico price. That's wild and shit. That's a good price.  Mitchell rolls. That's a great fight. Oh my God. Ryan Spane. Sam RVO right from the fucking jump.  It's awesome. Fire The night's all over the place. Good luck. Like such good cause it's such a good card.  Well when you're trying to jam you know all this goodness into one of that because you've had this fucked up situation happen where.  How many cards have been cancelled for five cards.  Yeah. For the last fight was in Brazil. And was that January was March. It was March.  It was right after the UFC event that I did, which was the seventh. I commentated on that one in Vegas. So I guess it was the fourteenth that was ill. That was what was at it, I think. I think somewhere around there, the fourteenth. And that was the one where Gilbert knocked out Damian Mayo.  That's right. Yeah, he's right. Wordly. Yeah, I like that fight. I like that a lot. I like that a lot.  I mean, you know, I love Gilbert, but for wordly to take that fight, you know, he really picks and chooses who he wants to fight. So, yeah.  What is they said that Dana, I got to talk to Dana this weekend and he probably if he tells me, I can't tell you or I'll tell you. Tell me. I can't tell everybody else.  There's some sort of a fight for the doll.  I think it's Conner on Fire Island. That's what my fight brain's going towards, because he said we have a bigger fight for Masvidal because they said Kamahl are responsible for the belt, right.  Does the top Frager fighting because we have a more exciting fight. My fight? Well, there's only two guys who'd be bigger Kaspi now, I'd love if GSB, but I don't think so.  You know why. No belt, no belt.  Enough to worry about Giuseppi taking off and taking off GSP fights mosfet all that'd be Gigantor the nice guy versus the bad boy giganto Connor Mastodon's the fight.  But then I was even thinking of GSP. I haven't really seen koner amazing amazingly at 170. Amazing.  Well I don't like Katsumi, but GSP Koner at one set rate for this.  How about Masvidal Nick Diaz.  Oh Nick Diaz. GSB Corner, same card fight island. Good Lord. I might have to take a trip to wherever the fuck it is. I might fly down there. Where do you think Fight Island is. I don't know, he said it's one of that Brunson's Islands, the Virgin Islands, the Virgin Records are fuck yeah. I'm pretty sure it's one of his islands.  Would you hear that?  The water cooler is the water cooler. Water cooler these days.  That's I thought it might be. But dude. Nick. Nick Diaz. Was it all now, does Nick Diaz definitely want to fight? I don't know, but I was in my brain, I'm thinking, who's out there? Who could be bigger than Kamara Usman? All either Connor or Nic?  Well, Nic would work because Masvidal beat up his brother.  Exactly. And redemption. He asked for that fight.  But it's always tough with the negotiations with Diaz is well, especially with Nick, because Nick has, in fact, since Anderson Silva was a tough time ago, tough go to Mars with all Connor.  When Mazlo was on food, drug diaries hit off camera. Him and his manager were like, Dude, it's Connor Mars at all. That's our fight. They told us they want it to. That's the fight.  Well, that was months ago. That was right. That was after he beat who he beat last. Ah, yeah, we Diaz, right? That's right, that's right, yeah, Halman literally like a week after that, he was like, oh, conures the fight. They're telling us he wants to fight. We want the fight. Wow. That's a big fight. Connor, Jesus, you're talking will be off the charts, do a press tour for them.  Yeah, you can't scare Mooresboro either. It a big fella.  I'm only 455 before. I mean, he 455 for a long time.  But it wasn't his weight class. I don't see Konkona at 70, though. He's going to fight him at 70. I guarantee you, if it was I was not going to go to 55.  Really? Is that what they said?  That's the that's what they said. That's that's what they were talking about. They want to mojado.  Well, they want to pull a Floyd Canelo on. As much as I love Masvidal, you are still the top, top dog in town. So you got to meet him a little bit halfway.  So he's the top dog in town. But I'm telling you, man, when you go to the UFC and you see the pop that Masvidal gets, there's this change in his style.  He's a star. He's a huge star right now. I mean, he might not be as big a star over the world as Connery's is not.  He's definitely not conures. Konrads eclipse the sport, but Masvidal was one of the biggest stars. He's his giant easily.  I think that fight would be bonkers, just straight up bonkers.  Connor said he wants to fight three times this year, but that's not happening. So they're going to have some big fights. Damn man, Masvidal, Connor. Talk to your boy serotypes. So who's going to fight Ousman? Jospeh GSB, a Colbie husband, told me husband has been a fighter, I mean, just beat Colbie. He just stopped Coleby, you can't you can't sell that Kolby rematch yet, not yet. Not yet. Kobe's got to beat somebody good.  You know, he's got to beat Leon Edwards. He's got to beat someone good.  Leon Edwards is like, yeah, boy, he got fucked up fucked. He got like, Woodly can't leave the country.  And he's as far as, like, how good he is versus public perception in terms of, like, the knowledge of him, people knowing how good he is. He's waiting for that one fight, that one big fight and wordly could have been that fight.  Wouldn't it have been that fight like there and still got cowboy right. That's how he got on the map. Then he got Wonderboy. Yeah, that's all Leon Edwards needs, like a wordly and then like a Coleby or something like that.  Well, if he beat Kolby, that would be it for him. That would be a good fight. That's a real good fight to make. Kolby versus Leon Edwards is a really great fight to make.  And both guys look, if both guys win, they've got a real argument to fight for the title.  Again, if Kobe wins, he's going to talk bad shit and he's going to you know where you are, Marty, and that kind of stuff.  And hilarious, dude, what happens?  Leon Edwards will fight next on Fire Island against high ranked opponents as Dana White finitely. All right, come on down. OK, who's that high ranked opponent? Who would that be?  Who else is left? Well, there's Wonderboy.  Wonderboy still in the great fight. That's a great fight. Who else? That one seven is in the mix. You see Guy Gilbert who's going to fight Woodly, which is a great fight.  So those two are accounted for Wonderboy. There's no fight for him right now. Who else is in the mix at the top of the food chain?  Did Wonderware not talk about going to eighty five? Did he thought he did. Really? It's just a fair question.  Maybe he said he would. OK, let's see what we got here at one seven.  All Damian Meyer, Michael Shaza. He's my dark person.  Oh yes. Very good. He's so big. It's so crazy to think that guy's fought 55 for so long.  He's a motherfucker to set number twelve. Neil Oh yeah. It's a monster jam.  Seventy years he missed the dark horse of 170 Jeff Neill. He's one of the most technical and talented guys in the division when when when he fought.  Mike Perry and knocked out Mike Perry with that left high kick, I was like, holy shit, Mr.. Jeff Neal, he's one of those guys where you look at him like he's something special, dude, when you look at history, you look at 55, 1785 to it is murderers row from top to fucking, top to bottom has no Sandro's fault, Leon.  He has a right. No, that's a possibility. A possibility. He said just beat those animals.  Yep. Gilberte, I mean, it really seems like Leon and Stephen Thompson is the way to go. Wonderboy and Leon. Leon seems like it has to happen. Right. Talk to your boy. I mean, that's probably what they're going to do on Fight Island.  If I had to guess, that'd be a great fight. That's a great fight. I like that a lot. Now, where's Robbie Lawler in the mix.  Robbie's at 11:00. It's interesting, right? Because after Kolby call, we just kind of ran him over, didn't he?  Hey, did Robbie versus Jeff Neil be a crazy fight? That's a great fight. That's a great fight.  That's a great coming out party for Jeff Neal. God, what I thought I needed was a big fight.  Dude, how about your boy Barbosa going down to 45? How the fuck does he do that? That guy's shredded. You can't be good. Can be shredded at 55.  And if you think 45, you then 55.  I got anything for your brother who is you fighting at 45 is fighting someone good times five. Yeah. Yeah, yeah.  Let me see the forty five pound ratings that 55 nasty. What's what you got here. Forty five. Pick your poison whosay fighting.  Pick your. I like. I can't remember who the hell he's fighting from. Shane Berghaus.  I don't know who he's fighting son. If I know he's fighting someone very good at 45.  See if you find dude to thirty five all the way up to 85 is so mad dad it's man it's so hard to become a champion.  Now there's a real good argument for opening up these divisions and having won every ten pounds. Now when you've got World Channel style burgers. Yeah that's a good point.  Now I've never been in favor of open up divisions, but now it's so stacked to get to the top, it'd be so fucking hard.  Well, not just that. It's like everybody is not going to get a chance because you have so many guys in a division that are world class too tough.  The title can't be defended that many times in a year and you only have so many years at your peak.  Yeah, you're right. Yeah. It seems like like I haven't seen in forever every ten pounds just open it up. I wonder why they're against it more.  Beltz You're doing all these interm bullshit. Beltz Why not open up the weight classes, give more guys chance to shine. I don't know.  Want to have the most delicious beverage of all time is in Asia. Yeah. Grape grape kill cliffe CBD there, caffeine in it.  No that's 25 milligrams of CBD though.  Right. Just try that on the fucking God damn delicious.  Um yeah. I mean where does it go. You know, and in eighty five.  What happens in eighty five now. Right. Like Darren till just said that he wants to be pretty good. Right. That's nice. They said Darren still wants to coach Ultimate Fighter opposite Israel Adesanya.  So he, he put that up on Twitter or Instagram or whatever it is.  A lot of stuff on the style banner just writes No stubbornest too big a star for that. They just, you know, does it just. No. Why would Style Banner do that? But it's the way he wrote it. He's a beast.  No, not happening. Just just this like no explanation. Just no.  Just no andere until the well but oh Dan e gay.  Oh too varied.  And first of all, Danny Gay has fantastic cardio. He's got great submissions. He's got great strikes. He's fucking ferocious. He's coming up. He's improving every fight.  I don't know the odds on that, but that ain't that ain't fun for Barbosa. Forty five killing himself to make forty five. I mean unless he knows something we don't in terms of like we went earlier, if he knew something. Angela Hill and QLogic Idalia is a great fucking fight to to Dimmeys who.  Well here I am. I'll step over him. Dude, what do you do with the winner Francis Rosen. Stroke you give them the interim title. That's right. Because stupid can't fight right now.  You know, he's he's he said he he goes, I can't get a hold of knocked down right now. I can't even get a full training camps. I'm not fighting, you know. He goes, no, I couldn't fight by August, but come on, dude.  Well, I don't understand that necessarily that that argument. But I, I do know that he's got real problems with his eye. Yeah.  It's an issue. It's a torn retina. And, you know, it's supposed to be healing and he's doing his best to heal. And I'd actually, you know, talk to him about it. And he's he's been pretty vocal about that.  It's not healed yet. And so he definitely should fight. Yeah.  He was talking about see if there's some stem cell options. But the people that he talked to are essentially saying that the only thing that's available is. Venus stem cells for overall body healing. You know what she could do for sure, and it would probably accelerate some of the healing, but it's a real problem.  How do you do your eyes? Are you busy? Yeah, exactly.  He should talk to business because I wonder if Bisping would go through the I know business said he was she didn't take the Telvin fight, I think.  Remember that when she heard his other eye. Yeah, I think so. Yeah. Yeah he heard is good on field. Talk to you about Eyes Bibi's being man. Yeah but WIPA. All right, so you're on the shelf. You got to give the intern belt to Francis and Rosen.  I think so. I think so. And there's no no one else that stands out.  And then if you're DC, he wants the belt, the real belt. So he's not going to fight the winner of Frances. She's on the right. You don't want it. Nobody wants to fight for it.  Dude, have you seen I text? Have you seen Francis shirt off?  Yes. What the fuck is training? We're not all the same. He's training hard. No, no.  Look, man, that guy is like a character in a movie. If you stop and think about his childhood learning how to fight and then growing up in a fucking like working in a sand mine and just just digging in the sand.  Yeah. I mean, it's like a Konan movie. Yes. He's so powerful, man, and he's so big. You're talking about a guy was cut and wait to make two sixty five and all natural just genetics. Look at that off the charts. Genetics, power, insane power. But I'll tell you man Rosen strike is no walk in the park. Yeah. He's a real elite striker man. Yeah.  Big fuck too. He's more decorated as far as striking and he's big man. He's fucking big like that though. No.  Not like does get some body fat on him but he's a solid to sixty five.  Rosen strike is huge bro. Have you met him. I haven't. He's enormous. Wrote The strike is fucking huge. I mean he hits on him.  He doesn't have the same amount of low body fat. No he doesn't, but he has great stamina.  I mean he knocked out Overeem in the fifth round with a few seconds to go.  Right. He's losing that fight. He was losing that fight.  But Overeem is a legit elite striker. Now, the difference between the way Overeem fought him and the way over in Fort Francis Overeem got stuck in these exchanges with Frances and Frances hit him with that left hook, which is just one of them, right.  It was like a shovel.  So one of the worst knockouts in the history of sport ever, ever, ever had. The puck in the back of his head slapped him in the ass. It really did.  Instead of bit, I've never seen that part of he can't just this African uppercut, this superhero fuckin Superman Surace left hook, boom, rozin strike and take it to like he was walking through Alster shots.  I bet he doesn't walk through Frances and no one wants to. Frances's CPA did a little bit.  He got hit by Bryce, though.  I think that part of what happened in the second fight or the first fight rather with DC was the damage that that Steep had incurred in the fight with France.  That's fair because he took some big shot, big shots, and then you get so many of those.  And when he got hit, knocked out like that, it's like he wasn't the biggest shot he got hit with. I don't think he saw it coming. But the way he went out from that shot, it's almost like it's like you got to wonder. Yeah. How much of that was a great point. Residual damage from battling the scariest fucking striker in the sport.  Yeah, I'm just super high on Frances now. I yeah. You know, you got humbled a little bit in that steep fight. He was like, dude is just too fat. I wasn't ready. I was too arrogant. Went back to the drawing board. You look at him now like, holy shit, who's going to beat us?  Yeah. Yeah. Ree's champ. I turned 21.  Well, I mean, he's I'm telling you, still got to get past Rosann strike, which I think he does.  My nose man, who knows I might not strike is a really talented striker, super talented. It's gonna be fucking crazy. It's going to be crazy. I can't wait for that thing.  Jeremy Stevens versus Calvin Carter is a crazy fight, too. You can't count you never can count out.  There's a lot of live dogs on this. If you like the best you can put together a parleying risk like a hundred and he can win fifteen thousand.  Yeah, it's like some crazy party. But you look like I can see that shit happening, man.  Yeah. Yeah.  And also, who knows what kind of fight camps these guys are getting. Right. Like this training partners to be the biggest thing. The only one I'm not worried about is Tony Ferguson. Well, he's a lone wolf.  What are Jim's Howard gems dealing with this? What happens to a guy like Tom Cruise? Is he allowed to go to the gym and train? Like how what do they do?  If you're one of those big names, I guarantee those guys are getting keys to the gym and going and doing other thing. But even if you get a key to the gym, are you allowed to do that? Like, this is one of the things going to stop. But this is one of the things that's been weird. They're giving people tickets for shit.  Do I get to ride my bike? What? I didn't tell you this? No, I got a ticket. Do we talk about this yesterday? I, I brought it up.  I was brought to life. It was. What did Elon say about you? I was like, I'll take care of this one when I ride my bike, like you do every day avoiding rattlesnakes. And I get on the descent. I'm in the middle of nowhere to know where I right from Woodland Hills to like Malibu. I'm in middle of nowhere in between there. And then I see two ranger trucks intercept me and they get out and they have masks on and I start laughing.  Oh, no way. You think we call it out here, fellas?  Do you think we can take the mask off, get to get the mask off? Nobody's going go without it. And they take their mask off. Like, I can't believe they listen. They take the mask off. I go, are you giving me a ticket? And he goes, Listen, here's the problem, dude, is the parks are closed. I go, they're closed. Since when he goes, how long have we been in quarantine?  I don't know how long we've been here. So I think like over 50 days. I mean, I've been out here every single day for the past 50 days. He goes, really did take it. Yeah, he goes, really? I go every day, dude. And he's like, well, you know, just got lucky.  And he goes, here's the problem is if a thousand people had your same mindset and came out here, then we'd have a problem. I go to Ziemba right here. Does anybody ride a bike here in the big guys? Like, I ride a bike. He goes, I'm part of the Thick Boy Bike Club. I know they say that I go.  So he knows. He knows. I go, dude, have you run out here? And he goes, I usually don't go this far.  And I'm like, well, you got to be in pretty good fucking shape.  You get all the way out here, man, and back. You think those people are in covid or spreading it? We're going to be fine, man. And he goes, You're probably right. It's not my doing it. Yeah, it's so good. Give me a ticket. He goes, No, I'm like, can you take a oh fuck yeah dude. Yes, but he is.  And this other guy gets out, gives me a ticket. How much. He says the lowest finding it gets like forty or sixty bucks. And I go it's only it's like sixty bucks. I go sixty bucks you'll see tomorrow. And they started laughing.  I was there, I was there the next day. I was there today.  Don't say this. They're going to come now. They don't make that example out of you. I don't give up that right. Are those one of those parks open? They're not open yet. Friday now.  Yeah, but you're supposed to wear a mask while you're, uh, while you're riding a bike. That makes no sense. Oh, my goodness. Do I saw a guy on his bike today out there with me on the trails.  He had the mask on I and to get the mask off, dude, get the fucking mask off, man. What are you doing? How are you going to get it out here?  It's not it doesn't make any sense. Everybody's so paranoid.  It's so weird looking at this sheet mentality. Man we're not in the ICU, OK? We're not in the hospital. We're not in a nursing home or do this.  My favorite when we're on these trails. Right. And you're pretty far apart and they see me and they put their mask on like.  OK, I go by, can't be my friend, Whitney told me she crashed and got really fucked up and no one came to help her, went over the front of the handlebars, almost broke her neck.  Nobody wanted to help her. And everyone's wearing a mask. Everyone kept going for not wearing a mask to know.  It's fucking dark out there, man. Bunch of bitches, especially out there. You know the sun. Yeah.  Those guys, I don't think they care. I was even talking shit about giving them to them. And they were like, dude, we don't agree with it. It's something we have to do. Yeah, they're just doing their job sucks.  That's why Tom, when I get it, man, what would it be like if a thousand people did it? First of all, a thousand people are going to fucking do it. A thousand people ain't coming out there, man. No, it's hard. That's why I told them you ride bikes, dude. You're part of the club. You know how hard it is to get out here, man. You know, if if they're going out here, then fucking shape it.  Even if we all got covid, we're all going to be fine. Yeah. And he was like, I get it, man. The problem is, once the narrative gets established, you know, once the narrative gets established, it's crazy me.  The news isn't held accountable for anything like the slander, the penalty.  Like why aren't you showing anything positive. Yeah, that's why I tweet out positive stats. I'm like, why don't you guys show anything positive? You're scaring the fuck out of people. They want to.  That's how they make money. They make money off advertising to make advertising off of use. They make use of scaring people.  And then China said they're starting to get overcovered. Release the fucking warrior hornets.  Where the fuck the murder horn is a murder, call it. That's what I thought this would when I walked in.  Dude, they're about that size, though. That's a tarantula hawk. I think those Asian hornets are actually bigger than that.  They make it makes me feel sick. Western Washington, I bet they're fucking thick asses are going to head to California. Everybody loves California. How many of them do they find? I don't know.  A shit ton. Right. Have you seen? I was like, how bad can it be? And I look on the video, they're intercepting bees and ripping their fucking hearts. Our heads off.  They snip their heads in half with their mandibles. Yeah. And they kill thousands of bees. Look at the size of these fuckers. Oh, my God.  And they show up on these at these colonies, these bee colonies. They show up at the hives and do just burn through the hives. They start chopping heads off.  There's a horrendous video of these Asian hornets that show up at this beehive and just start chopping them in half. Have you seen that video of that Coyote Peterson guy? Let's once sting him and it. Oh, my God, my.  It's the camera guy. What she is the guy's like, oh, God. Oh, God. All right. Now tell us what you're feeling, man. We got that's why we do it. You got to tell people you're feeling like, all right, you can tell he's like super annoyed is the worst pain.  It seemed pretty bad. Well, and then twenty minutes later, his arm had swelled up like someone shoved a shoe under his skin. It was like all popped up and Puffy couldn't touch anywhere near it. He was in agony.  Dude, have you seen kings? Is it kings of pain? Jamie? I think it's OK now. Remember, it's on I think it's on the History Channel.  I think it's on History Channel.  But it's these two dudes, one Australian dude, one regular American who's a Marine. And they're like the the pain scale hasn't been done since, like the 1970s. So we're going to go around. We give it a one, two thirty. We rank on the rank among these, you know, criteria's. So they go around all over the world. These fuckin dudes, man, they they collect these wasps, they collect, you know, the tarantula hawk and then the finale.  I'm like, well, what are they gonna do here? They get a they catch a giant boa constrictor in the forest and then they put a mask on so we can't bite their neck and kill them. And then they give the thing their arm. Dude, this fucking python destroys their arm. Was it a python?  Our bark structure? I don't know. Reticulated Python says, yeah, pythons have horrendous they have horrendous fangs. Kings of pain. Oh, Jesus. Why is it biting the guy's arm?  Well, they want to see how painful it is. No one's ever done a pain scale on a python. Oh, my God, that's a big that was a Komodo dragon or something that didn't get off like 10 minutes. Yeah, the Komodo dragon they did couldn't get it off of them for ten minutes, just kept it snapped.  And it was just they had like soap. They're like spray the soap in its mouth. The lizard, like, I don't give a fuck.  But Komodo dragons have poison in their mouth. They might have been a Moneta crazy lizard bites last ten minutes.  Is it a cold right under my nose? OK, well, they're in the same family. Oh, Jesus. They can't get it off.  They can't get it out. Well, I know how to get it off. You put a bullet in that fucking thing's brain. I'd be like, fuck this game. Oh, my God, it won't let them go.  Look at that then. So the one guy does it and then they switch. They both have to do it.  So I would definitely want to go first. Oh, yeah. Well, why don't they put a wedge in its mouth like you do with a pit bull? Look at him punching the board.  No one knows what to do. Its claws are getting into them. So. Oh, so my thing is I looked at I want to see how much they get paid to do this. I don't think what I was hoping they hate was man, look how it's using its claws.  I'm pretty sure the one guy's like a Marine. The other guy's just like, you know, the Crocodile Hunter recipes, but so stupid.  This is such a white guy thing to do. This is like what little little devil calls white boy in his little devil and this white boy can't get enough of it. I've been watched all 10 episodes in like and I couldn't get enough of it one day just through all of it. Why do you like it, though?  Because it didn't say, man, no desire to watch that really and see which animal hurts the most. Really tells it all sucks. Don't, don't don't get bit.  I know why it's doing this. I fear that the idea me because I keep giving the show praise and he's like dude for four seasons No.  Two or three and having celebrities on and we'd love to have you on.  I was like, oh well maybe I see like I don't know if I want to let a crow bite me. Yeah. See how bad those pigeons. Right. Well what's the scale of parakeet.  Yeah. I don't know. I don't know. Why not for me the fuck out of here. I have this weird because I see I think campaigns possibly to him. Graham, I don't think it's a rattlesnake but he came across snake. He's like, yeah, save these things. Ones like Shub. You got to start doing this, man. We run the snakes. And even before I saw him do that, I've had this weird urge to grab the snakes.  I don't know what it is might be, but I have this weird urge to just grab the snake and like, I don't know, fuck with it. Like, hold it.  You bring anything with you, like a stick or anything. Nothing, Joe. That's why I'm like, dude, I need that knife. Because the problem is if I take my specialized stump jumper, it makes noise. It makes noise.  If I take this is like this this white t is like it's silent so the animals don't hear me come in.  So today I stop on three coyotes, pretty big, pretty big coyotes. Well, they're looking at you funny. Yeah.  And I was yelling that's I knew what to do and my fellow yelling give a fuck. Oh they didn't give a fuck.  So not scared of people, you know, they literally just was like, look, this was a fucking moron doing that. Like, I wish you were smart. I could eat you can eat you. Yeah. But if you fall down, fall down, it's OK to break a leg. But I was thinking that's why I text you when I got done to him. I don't have anything do I don't have a knife.  I don't have anything.  Yeah. It'd be a problem with the rattlesnake. I don't know what the fuck it. It's just you know it is what it is.  Well with a rattlesnake most of the time you just got to get out of the way of them. They're not interested in the coyotes are interested in you either. A mountain lion might see.  And where I went today, there's pictures of mountain lions, pictures like warnings.  So, yeah, that'll give you the heebie jeebies. Saw a bobcat. I see a bobcat probably once every ten right there.  Weird looking after their feet. Fucking fat.  Yeah. It's like they wear it out there like Exxon and they just hang on the tree and stare at me.  They're weird. I told you I'd find a bobcat up. No, I regret that because when I saw my cat. Well, here's your chance. They're pretty big.  They're pretty big. They're pretty big and ferocious. It would be a problem for sure.  Yeah. And plus, who knows what kind of fucked up diseases they have inside their mouth.  Even a housecat like I mean, you're fucked with the how even those cats. Fuck, yeah. Yeah.  A house cat that wants to kill you. That's a real problem.  Bob can think of a rat like a rat wanted to kill you like a five pound rat, like a big ass New York City. Probably terrifying, terrible bobcat is literally like twenty times bigger than the problems.  I talk all the time about nature. I run into it when I saw a bobcat like dude talking. All that shit is a block away.  It's not even 10 times bigger than a five pound rat. But rats don't really get to be five pounds. Know, I'm sure some of those New York City good, five pounds, 10 and 20 pounds.  That's what those for Bobcat, 18 pounds. So, yeah. You had a bobcat in my backyard problem? Yeah, they're gross, those little fucks, but coyotes don't fuck with people, right? They will.  Coyotes kill the girl in Canada a few years back, 19 year old lady, she was a promising folk singer and she's wandering around the woods.  And the coyotes found it by herself and they circled around her. Yeah, they killed her.  That's a terrible way to die to a really bad way to die.  Got that be a bummer. I don't think I was going to fuck me like it's too big. I'll use the bike as a weapon. I would hope so, yeah. I would hope so. Well, no, you never said all about going to the ABC this weekend. No, no, no, no, no.  I'm nervous about how weird people are going to be, that people are going to be acting real strange, hate people. The cove, it's made me hate people. Yeah, I'm not worried about the actual disease, I'm worried about people.  Yeah, I'm worried about people freaking out like I get my coffee at ten speed, this guy. And I'm trying to be funny. Probably 400 pounds, six foot, just so out of shape. He worked security there. He's like, you come in without a mask, there's no line. There's no one in there. I'm like, homeboy, that mask everything that gets you, dude, it's your fucking cholesterol. Then leave me alone, man.  Well, trust me, I'm trying to outlive you. My man can't come here without a man's heart to heart.  What the fuck? Nothing can be fine in Florida. Well, Jacksonville is a weird place, I've never been in Jackson. I've been to Jacksonville. What's it like? It's it's it's not that crowded. It's not like a big you know, it's not like your country is a pretty country. Pretty laid back. Tim Tebow is from there. I used to do this golf tournament every year. Oh, really? It's nice down there. Super laid back.  I don't want to calmly out there. Well, they're the first people to say, fuck it, let's do it all. Florida did all right. I think so.  I think Florida's basically opened up for everything. Missouris opened up for concerts.  Most of it, I think they didn't open up like or Miami and Palm Beach. Are those three counties down there? They well, the Bay Area, too.  I'm getting so many offers for clubs really in June. So clubs are about to open up again. Huntsville Wiseguys, Salt Lake, Nashville and Spokane, like all all these clubs are starting to come about. Good. I love it.  I don't know what's the store open was considered a legitimate time as I considered a restaurant.  Right. There's one guy on stage. Why not?  It's a live show. It's a theater. Well, it's kind of a live show. More.  It'd be more.  Wouldn't it be labeled a restaurant when anything bothers fucking hundreds of people, it's not going to kitchen. It's food and.  Yeah, drinks. That's their because you know the servers. Yeah, yeah. And just sitting people at tables, you have one guy you know.  Yeah. Because restaurants should open up in phase three. Yeah, well, I'm probably a certain capacity, but yeah, they're opening up way before some others.  Oh, that's the thing. These clubs I've been talking about, they're all they're all not at full capacity. It's all less.  So that's what's going to happen at these clubs. So you get a reduced rate. Yep. Interesting.  Which is 50 percent less people.  I know wiseguys, guys open up that open mike night. And I think it was 150 people. They already opened. I'm pretty sure they did their open mike. Really? Yeah. Yeah.  Utah. I know. I looked at some of the restaurants in Utah Park City still not open, but Salt Lake City has some some restaurants are open, but most of them are open just for takeout.  Feel was in actually. Why says there what they're doing is they are open yet 65 percent capacity.  Not bad. Hey, that's better than nothing. Customers will be asked, keep a minimum of six feet between groups and while waiting in line, all customers will be seated, by the way.  Well, touching the same shit, breathe the same air. It's all crazy, dude.  I'll do the meat. Green spoke and lick everybody's face. Hand sanitizer stations are located at club entrances and at the front desk. All high touch surfaces, including, but not limited to tables, chairs, menus, doorknobs, faucets, bathrooms and more been sanitized will continue to be disinfected after every show.  I love this. Customers are not required to wear a mask. I will show with everybody when a. Yeah, fuck that awful dude.  I'll start doing shows other places. I'll go to fucking Utah and percent. We should go down there.  I'm happy to go down there. I mean, I don't know what I'm doing. I have so many gigs that are booked we're doing.  We're supposed to be doing arenas in September. I don't know if that's going to happen here. We are incredibly close. The problem is the ticket sales are sold out.  So it's not a problem. You be close, I think, because because you see the NFL, I think we release schedule.  Is it tonight, Jamie? You know what? They changed nothing.  Really? Yeah, I felt it sucked this whole arenas. Yeah. I don't know. They haven't said anything about attendance, but as far as scheduling goes, everything. And now what the fuck are they going to do here in L.A.?  Because our governor sucks. He's not. He's not. He's a safety first.  Yeah, but you're getting where people aren't putting up with and he has to change. Right. People are freaking out about him. It's not good for the protest at his house. Oh, he's fucked. He won't win a protest at his house. Yeah. Shut up. His house real. Oh, yeah. That's like the beach thing. I told him I. I'm telling these people to put up with these beaches.  Big thing that's happening. When is when is the night. What's the Saturday. Saturday. It is a big, big sort of demonstration that's planned. Right. Isn't it? I don't know. So it's weird, I mean, we are opening up like I can argue with my dad about covid and he's like, I don't know why you're crying. We're opening back up again. But not quick enough.  Did not quick enough. Not quick enough. Yeah.  Oh, just what they should do is quarantine the people that are at high risk at this point, you know, have to quarantine the whole country anymore.  But when Newsome goes so far left and he's like, here we are meant you can't dial it back, he has to be forced to dial it back because otherwise he looks like an asshole. Nate, I'm not eager to give it up.  Yeah, he's it's hard to change paths once you've already committed to a certain path. It's a bummer, it's just a bump almost through it. Listen, though, I'm positive this quarantine is we've all kind of got to relax. You know, you've got to win when you have stand up your shows. You have all this thing going. We're moving a million times an hour. I've got so much time with my kids starting fight club.  You know, I like rattlesnakes now. I've lost weight.  I've really enjoyed not going on the road, but I've enjoyed that a lot.  I was enjoyed going and they forced me to shut everything down.  Yeah, I've really enjoyed that. Not flying. I've enjoyed that a lot. Flying. Fuck you up, man.  It's not good for your body, man. You know, I had Jesse man here last week chasing the same thing. She was like, I can't believe how good I feel.  Yes, I feel great. Best I've ever felt.  We're killing ourselves. Yeah.  Oh, but but I missed the fact I missed the road, man. Yeah.  Oh I miss the shows. I miss the store. I miss performing.  I definitely miss, I miss writing new material but I haven't written a god damn thing, have written any stand up.  It's tough to stuff. Feel creative during this lockdown man. Well the other shit going on you can I mean you can.  Right. You could. I could have written. I just decided not to. I decided I'm just going to just do do podcasts and work out a lot.  How many years have you think nonstop. I also thought maybe this is a this force break is good for everybody.  This is good for me. You can make it good for you. You can decide it's bad or decide it's good. But do the thing that I decided is I want to see how I feel about this organically, you know, instead of trying to make comedy out of it right away, I just want to see what my real feelings are about this.  Like let it let it seep in.  And then, you know, once once I've got a handle on how I feel about it. Well, my take is then then do some do some writing.  What's done for me is that I feel great. I feel better. Started by club lost weight. But the other thing is I've gotten I've paid more attention to politics because it's never really affected me. And whatever these guys are fucking con artists. But then when they lock down your lifestyle, that's like, what are we doing here, man? They need to look into things like, holy shit.  We went over the list with Hinchcliffe yesterday. We went over the list of all things the governor, the governor has approved for outdoor activities. And it's so condescending, it's so ridiculous and so fucking stupid. This is a long list of things you can and can't do. It's so stupid.  It's not. Yeah. It's also shows you how little power governors have. Yeah.  Well, also it shows you how they like that power. They like it. Well you don't want to tell you what to do.  They're not saying, hey, keep six feet apart from each other and, you know, use social distancing guidelines and be safe. They're not saying that. They're saying here's the things you can do. You can enjoy the sunrise and sunset free. You can enjoy yoga, you can enjoy bike riding, you can enjoy golf, but no cartes.  So that says no carts we'll take. People got upset because they posted that the city of Venice filled the skate park with sand because they want kids stop skating. And I put this is lame as fuck. And I had all these comments like, no, it's not like I've ever looked at the mortality rate of young kids. It's zero. Yeah.  And you're taking away their happiness. What about mental health? Have we thought about mental health and gone outside and what that does for those kids? What about that?  Well, they're worried that the kids are going to get it. They're going to give it to the grandma, dad or. Someone's going to get sick, but you don't you can't mandate good behavior. You can't tell people and you need to be smart in terms of like infectious diseases doesn't work.  Give me give me a guideline. So this is what's probably best and then let let the people of America decide. Yeah.  Once they figured it out, people know what to do and what not to do. You're going to allow people to make all these bad choices no matter what. You can allow people to drink. You're allowing people to smoke.  You're allowing people to take prescription medication.  They're they're killing themselves left and right, doing all kinds of other different things.  How many people die every year in America? You know, you have to look that up. It's not something we don't pay attention to that. We just we just go now. That's just normal.  Well, we're willing to put up with that. You know, well, the thing is about most of the decisions, like for cigarette smoke and car accidents, stuff like that, like you decide, right? You decide to drink, you decide to smoke, you decide to drive your car.  And this is it's not contagious. This is contagious.  The worry is that you're you're giving it to people that they it's not their choice to get it.  You know, old people in particular stay away from old people. But it's the same thing with the flu. Right?  Any of it? All of it. Yeah, I don't know. The real problem is if this if they start doing this for the flu, they start this is a bad flu season. So we're going to institute social distancing. I'll fucking move.  I will have like Utah here. I come home at that point. Going to. If it were if we got worse. Winstar open up. I was at that point, I was in the film about maybe doing something.  Where would you go. Colorado is a good choice from their side, like something new if I go to Texas and Texas is a very good choice, Texas, they don't give a fuck, they're free. I talked to Adam Curry. He's already eaten dinner in restaurants.  Yeah, Theal said he was. And he went to St George, Utah, this past weekend. He's now in a restaurant. That place is a shithole. But best restaurant I read at.  Yeah, man. What does that going to be like eating in a restaurant again?  But meanwhile, you're going to your server is going to be wearing a mask and like, what the fuck, you know, what the fuck are you smiling? That black dude? Can you tell if they're smiling?  Hopefully not. Hopefully people read the actual statistics and everyone kind of learns from this.  And the problem is they're already committed to this doom scenario. You know, millions of people are going to die. Well, millions of people are going to die, period, or millions of people going to die for this disease.  I don't know if that's true. You know, I must say, that's not true. Listen, Ellen, I know eight people have gotten it. The worst was Michael Yo. He came in sick.  I came in sick. He did? Yeah. Underlying health conditions and came in sick and was flying.  And he's half Asian. I think that now he's Asian. I don't think that matters.  OK, well, he's coming here on Monday.  Is he talking about it?  I'm going to put him in a plastic bubble in the corner.  You get him tested before he comes on three times. Oh, yeah. At least make him wear a mask.  Oh, yeah. He's got to wear a mask, gloves to oven mitts.  He's fine. No, look at them thriving. He actually got tested three days ago, so he's fine. Sturgill Simpson, he he caught it. He was fine. He just said fatigue felt a little the entire Utah jazz team got it.  Nothing asymptomatic. No. What? They were pissed.  Of course, they're fucking superathletes. He think that shit has a chance in the body of a super athlete.  You think that shit has a chance of every UFC fighter on the card this weekend?  Yes. Well, how many judges? I want to know how many jujitsu guys are getting it. You want to talk about people that are like constantly being exposed to other people's funk nonstop?  Yeah, nonstop.  You're rolling with five or six people a day. Everybody's in a room together sweating like crazy or literally rolling in puddles of other people's sweat, like the immune systems that you must have from doing jiu jitsu.  It must be off the charts.  What phase is gyms that phase three, this phase three lame ass fuck. Is it phase three? Yes, phase three. So that's when they can open up. Yeah.  Anybody who wants to open up, can they open a jujitsu gym, open up a regular gym, they're going to spray down the surfaces. And I mean, I think they're talking like spinning classes and shit. I don't know if they're talking about jujitsu.  I don't think they're detailed enough where I be introduced to gyms. Open up. God, I hope so, too. I hope so. They will. Oh, so weird. And then the requirements for the fighters this weekend, did you read the whole list like these poor guys? Yeah, it's crazy. It's crazy. The requirements are nuts.  And the winner goes to another tunnel where the interview secluded. Yeah.  I wonder what kind of restaurants are going to be open in Jacksonville, run a service. Yeah, I don't even know if Jacksonville's restaurants are open yet.  Like, where are we going to be able to eat?  I'm in and Outman, I'm in there on, I'm getting there Saturday morning and I leave Sunday morning, there's no way and no way and no public way.  And I mean, the whole deal is just winds are supposed to be public anyway. The only time I'm there is to, you know, to do it on ESPN. And I do. I'm there for the presentation and I announce the fighters weights and interview the, you know, the main event coming about how cool would it be if Florida's.  Okay, we're going to open it up. If you want to go, you have this sign. This is great. Sold out.  Oh, yeah, for sure. Dude would be sold out.  I want people to buy this pay per view, man. Yeah, they're going to buy it. It's going to be huge. I hope it's going to be giant. I hope it's going to be giant. I'm I guarantee you people are sold even with the economy down like this.  Thirty million people out of jobs. There's so many people look, there's so many people that are out of jobs. That's a fact. But people have some money and they need some fucking form of entertainment.  They need something you'll see is going to get people together, too, because people watch you offseason with their crew. Yeah. So my kiddo, are you really that scary? Koven I get the fight. All right. Coming over. I'm going over a pizza and then everybody can get together.  You imagine watching fucking the fights with your boy and he's wearing a mask.  Dude, my producer. Can I go. Are you watching the fight. Yes. Yeah, me my buddy's going to zoom it wrong and watch it and get zoom on it. Don't talk to him for the the day. Oh God.  God damn it. I hope they get some bomb by some fucking asshole so fucking gives you a virus dude.  Assumed you deserve it. Zoome Bombers click show. People are having Zoome meetings.  They find it and they just fucking fuck sat back.  It's like a serious meeting. People need to grow up and pull their pants down. Put their ass on a webcam board is fuck.  Oh it's going to be real weird over the next six months when you see the economy because you know the way a friend of mine put it, he goes, there's so many people that are out of work right now.  They don't even know it yet because their business is not going to be able to survive whatever they're in, whatever they do in small businesses, they think at the high end and we might lose as many as 40 percent of all small businesses.  But then and for and for what? When we look back on it? For what, man?  Well, I wonder I wonder what the death rates are going to be when it comes to suicide, depression, starve it hunger. One in five kids are starving, one in five right now.  I just read where in America. One in five one in Florida looked that shit up, Jamie, one in five during the when there's depression, one in five. Oh, jeez, domestic violence is up, suicide will be up.  Swardson told me he was talking to the sheriff and the sheriff said they usually deal with about one suicide a week and now they're dealing with five a day. No, no saying yes, we have, but let's keep the old healthy man, let's let's let's stay quarantined like you have no idea the implications. This is awful, man.  I wonder how how this is going to affect the governor politically. So I really want yeah. I really wonder if you wants to put down his throat. Even Democrats. Really?  Yeah, he sure. But that is. No, I don't know that. I think his poll numbers are fairly high. It was one in seven before this.  So one seven and five kids are starving, one in seven before this shit hit. Yeah.  And a fair amount of them were getting food like at school. That's a thing.  School program putting out right to eat meals. They have got found ways to do programs that have stopped down a little bit of food. But yeah, that was their whole day. That was their child care.  And if you're a mom, if you're a mom with little kids, toddlers, you're your break your fucking grace for the day. Is those kids going to school, going to daycare when you don't have that? Yeah, dude, it's a big you know, it is with little kids right now.  What happens to those moms if they're single moms and their kids are at home and they have to go to work?  Still, Mozumdar, they're out of a job too, but they're stuck with the kids and everyone's just going, well, they do if they don't, but they're not out of one house.  They have to work and the kids can't go to school because the schools lost them.  Doesn't care about that man. Let's make sure that the old people are OK. The economy goes to shit.  Do you think that's his perspective? Do you think he's looking at it politically? I think politically. And if they can ruin the economy and that's what Trump's known for, then it's going to give Biden a better chance or hot take to turn Trump.  Just kidding.  I was looking at this article with this woman said that I believe Tara Reid, the woman that says that Biden sexually assaulted her and I'm voting for Biden anyway just to get Trump out of office.  I saw that crazy bitch. How crazy is that then? How about then how about Biden comes out and was like, we got to believe these victims. And when I become president, I'm a changed the law. They should be heard. It's like.  Huh? Yeah. The fuck are you talking about, dude?  It's your horse shit. It's crazy. They're all full of shit, all of them. It's just some weird ideological battleground. And Trump's not doing a good job either. It's hard to defend him like he's he's so worked up about all the stupid shit and telling the media he was being sarcastic so that they reported that he said, you know, I really didn't mean to inject Lysol.  And it's affected.  It's all bull. It's all nonsense. Men, when when you look at all these politics, you're like, oh, this is all a bunch of nonsense. I know.  But to see how combative he is, it's not so silly.  It's such it's such a waste of time and energy and it makes him look so bad. But that lady, that new press secretary, she is, and he sent me a video, too. She's a gangster. Have you seen that video? Never seen someone more prepared for a question in your life, Jamie.  Have you seen that? Yeah, I'm talking small point on that.  Not the big point, but small point. She was so prepared. Yes, that's what I'm saying. Well, she's supposed to be prepared. That's why I said you've never seen. So prepare for that. They're there specific questions. Yes. Because they're prepared. And you know why they're prepared? Because they're trying to play. Gotcha. Yeah. She played gotcha with them. She checkmated.  She came in there with that fucking Elon Musk flamethrower. That video played that video like Leonardo DiCaprio. You're on the air on the. No, no, no. I was saying, oh, God, no.  Hey, listen, before everyone jumps in, I almost was saying that it almost seems like she was working with that reporter to say, hey, feed me this so I can shit on everybody now that I got, because that does happen.  That guy was yelling. He was like, oh, you are ready for the hold on, hold on. What do you just see?  Self served up a softball so she could fucking fire off the machine.  No, I don't know. I don't have didn't. That's not what he did at all. Like, I tried to play gotcha with her. Do you want to take your word back? Because she said that Trump is not going to let Coronavirus come into the country. And what she's saying, the reason why they're shutting down travel from Asia is because they're worried about the coronavirus coming to the country. And Trump's not going to let that happen. They they tried to take what she said and and take it out of context or frame it, make her look bad.  While she was saying that Trump is not going to let the country get infected by the coronavirus, she's trying to say is that she's not going to have free travel where people have coronavirus because it's going to bring the virus in. Not that it's the only way the virus is going to get here.  The virus got here anyway, but came with the fire guys. Jamie, are you going to take that by it's a first of all, it's a douchy question like all those kind of douchebags in the first place.  They're trying so hard to have these moments where they they fucking play gotcha. But when when do these journalists quit being journalists? I become like fucking trolls off Reddit, like some of the questions, the Trump. That's why Trump got so hard in the paint on them.  I know, but he goes too hard. The problem, he cares too much, cares to my kids too much about what they think.  A lion should not be so concerned about the opinion of sheep, correct, Nazih?  It's not it's not becoming of someone who's in such a powerful position.  You're the president. Yeah. That guy's a fucking writer for the way she handles it, though. Oh, my God. She just dropped a was sassy. If all these ex wildy coyote with the TNT, but she's like, you ready?  You want to do it now. Oh yeah.  And then she had a big smile and walked off as you're trying to say, and he's like, are you prepared for that. Yes. Thank you. Have a good day. Oh gee. You think she'd prepare for it with all those stats that she read right in front of you?  Do they need to hire your boy, Elon Musk to get on that first video? POWDERLY The first thing I have didn't have the video link. I, I retweeted it.  He's holding onto it. He doesn't want to give it to us. Oh, Jesus Christ. Jamie doesn't want to know.  Gee, I guess because of this, I'm in the middle of doing five things and switching the cameras with me, we're just playing. No one online thinks you guys are playing real well.  People online. I love Jamie Vernon and we're just playing. However, I do know that he's on the wrong side. Oh, he's on the side of the bad guys. That would be fun for you.  I'm going to say let me go to the fight companion, Mike. Oh, here it is. Here, play this. Hold on. Full, full page and make it loud.  President Trump will not allow the coronavirus to come to this country, given what has happened since then, obviously. Would you like to take that back?  Well, first, let me note, I was asked a question on Fox Business about president's travel restrictions. I noted what was the intent behind those travel restrictions, which is we will not see the coronavirus come here. We will not see terrorism come here, referring to an earlier set of travel restrictions. I guess I would turn the question back on the media and ask similar questions. Does Fox want to take back that they proclaim that the coronavirus would not be a deadly pandemic?  Does The Washington Post want to take back that they told Americans to get a grip. The flu is bigger than the coronavirus, which is The Washington Post, likewise, which kick back that our brains are causing us to exaggerate the threat of the coronavirus is The New York Times want to take back that fear of the virus may be spreading faster than the virus itself. Does NPR want to take back that the flu was a much bigger threat than the coronavirus?  And finally, once again, The Washington Post would like to take back that the government should not respond aggressively to the coronavirus. I'll leave you with those questions and maybe you'll have some answers in a few days. I might just do a few words about your drink. That shit in Jamie Drink. You are prepared for that? Oh, yeah. Oh. Like you wish you practiced. Bullshit question.  Imagine you have one opportunity to ask her a question and that's what you ask her this.  But then you get the fuck up lit up.  Dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, dot, boom.  And then you get out of there everyone's like, yeah that's crazy. Yeah. You got served, you fucked up. He got served.  I want Dana. He's asking a question. I'm throwing it out there. You guys can say that's not it, but I'm just asking a question.  Go ahead. Ask you, what was it you think it was a soft touch, etc.. Now he's a cunt. You could see this guy is I'm just asking nicely that what he was doing like that that was a is a country question. I don't know if he's maybe a really nice guy. You look at his face, though. That's his job. His job is to try to get attention and get some gotcha. Yeah. So he played gotcha and he got caught smack down in the game of politics.  He might get one back in two months by helping her out now and now. They're going to be a little bit of friends because they definitely play both sides of the Jaimie's online way too much to keep an eye on it.  Jamie, Jeremy's on the market down. This is one that one YouTube video that everybody sending me the servers. And you got to look into this about that lady who apparently worked for Foushee. What do you know about that?  When I read it, she did it work for Falchi. So she's a liar.  I'm not saying that, but that's. Well, what did you read and where did you read it?  Is there an article you could pull up? It's God damn it, ten fucking people you're to look into.  It seems pretty good. What is it? She used to work for Falchi. I don't have the time to get taken down. Yeah, I've watched a few minutes of it and I try to click on the link. Twenty minutes later, it's taken down. A new one pops up YouTube keeps pulling it down, got fouled.  She talked about a pussy. Hmm. Well he Hey. Did come up with a do you have any solutions. Well just shut the world down for a couple. It's just doomsday.  All the it. Oh you want to shut down everything non stop. I do got to say the Bill Gates seems really excited about vaccines.  And you know, what I've heard from more than one person is that, first of all, I don't know if there's ever been a coronavirus vaccine.  I don't think there has been right. I don't think so.  And two of the other things they're saying that even if you get vaccinated for this, you might have to get vaccinated every year for it. It might be something that returns every year in some new form and you have to get vaccinated again. Jesus Christ.  And there's no there's no indication so far that people who have antibodies are 100 percent immune to it. Also, they found out there was an article. See if you can find this, figure out about that Falchi thing, see if you can find this.  There was an article that said that they've determined that the people in Korea, at least, who tested negative for the coronavirus and then tested positive that these were some I think they were described as latent antibodies in their system and that they're just such a small amount that even though they're testing positive, it's still from the initial infection and not septic residue in there. Yeah, it's not like a new infection.  Boy, did we fucked up their testing to see if they've been reactivated by. Being worn down or something, being like reinvent re infected, yeah, I think it's funny to how, you know, like Texas, Ohio, Atlanta, Utah, Denver, the city's opening up and people on see, look what happens when we open up more cases like no Don Dump's were testing more. So of course, there's going to be more cases. Yeah, there's all I care about is the mortality rate.  The mortality rate. Gnomeo in Denver yesterday, zero.  Nobody died in Denver. Nobody yesterday. Well, Utah or was it Montana and Montana is one death ever one death from from covid.  We moved it. You can take this operation to Utah or Montana. Montana gets real cold, bro.  Yeah, I don't want to cold so you can go do. Yeah. Utah, Texas. Dude, Texas does not get cold but it gets hot.  I don't mind the hot but they are good food, great food. Good people like to accent great clubs. Yes. Great place to work out the best. Well Salt Lake City wise guys are some of the best clubs don't have of them now.  No wise guys. Yeah. They have at least two. I don't know if the one the main one. I think they have at least two. Really. Yeah. I love Keith. Yeah.  Wise guy is a great club. My favorite people. Yeah. They're at Salt Lake City Club is fucking his brother.  You're like this Jimmy. His brother was the offense coordinator. Alabama. OK, yeah. Roll tide. So I'll talk to him about football. Casinos is shit man. It's such a good dude man. Such a good idea.  Yeah. That's an underrated place. Salt Lake City real underrated. The Mormons got everybody so scared of Salt Lake City. You can go there at five o'clock in the afternoon.  There's no traffic that's great out there. And go to the red iguana, get that Mexican food I to go out a good spot.  Oh, my God. You can get fat. They're easy. It's so real easy. Yeah. Get shopping out there.  It's clean. It's very nice. Get hotels. Yeah. Very nice. Yeah I like it. I like Utah period. Nice people.  The that I have a show end of June which is almost sold out in Spokane and I do mean streets and the clubs I know meet and greets friends. I can meet with anyone because there were about Korona. I emailed my manager this morning. That dude, I'm not I'm good to meet and greet man. I'm telling you, I'm good. I'm comfortable with that. He's all really I'm. I just tell you I'm good. Yeah. The clubs freaked out.  Oh my gosh. Sign a waiver, whatever you want, but I'm I can go there, not meet people.  Dude, uh. So when do you think is going to be back to normal or people won't be scared anymore? Let the beaches suck on the thumb and hide in the rest of us, just go about our business, man.  As my dad, about what it was like for polio, like in the 50s when they're growing up and like that summer when people were getting tested, like people were afraid to jump in pools because they're like there's like polio in that pool, don't get in there. So it might last through the summer, you know, until well, the worry is that it comes back in the fall.  And I don't totally understand this. When they're going to say it's going to die off in the heat and then come back when it gets cold again.  You mean like flu season? Yeah. You like your standard flu season. Well, here's the other thing is we did the quarantine to, you know, really protect the old and those at risk, but also to make sure the hospitals can, you know, tolerate the mass of people coming in there with covid. Well, I think we've done a pretty good job of that. And that's why we're opening up those hospitals. A lot of them are shutting down.  They can't afford to stay open and not crazy.  I mean, you pulled my mask. New York says hold my mask. The crazies in New York. Yeah, but other than that man.  Yeah, I have friends who are nurses stuff, especially in Texas and L.A. And I know people are scared to come in here now because they think they're covered here. I so weird. The whole thing's a fucking it's like we're living in a real shitty black mayor episode. It's like the most boring episode of all time.  Well, the guy from black mayors says he's not even going to have a season this year because you can't like this is the world is too bonkers for him to be able to do black mayor.  So he's going to have to let it sit out and even watch it or even watching Ozark. Do you watch Bozak? So did I.  Did you watch the whole season all through the end, benched him. All the ends. I can't get enough of the fuck.  I can't get enough.  I as soon as the last episode of Season three was over, I Googled When does Season four start what to say?  But the answer like, how are you going to leave me hanging like that?  Everything's on hiatus. Oh no, they can't act.  So they have to get close to each other. Oh, God. Someone might get the cooties. I watch Hunters with Al Pacino Nazis. Oh, how's that?  Amazing. Really? Oh, it's good really. Is that a series or is that a series of series on Amazon?  Oh, Amazon is doing some good shit, man. You've watched marvelous Mrs. Masel.  No, I want to though. You said it's good. First two seasons are very good. Third season lost me at the beginning, but I might try it again now that I'm back.  Now that I am that now that Ozark is over.  Oh, I'm sorry. Those aren't has to be top five of all time. It's fucking amazing show. It's so, so fucking good. And you know, it's crazy. We were just talking about this. The scariest people on the scariest show are women. That Darlene bitch is the scariest woman in all of television, the the the lady lawyer poppies. Yeah, the law, that crazy bitch. Yeah, that one. And then so earlier and spoiler in three to one.  And then she's hooking up like that 17 year old Larry. She kills her husband. Yes.  She's so she can sound crazy but she shoots home. Yeah. To keep it so bad at spoilers.  Yeah. It's a spoiler alert. It's been out long enough. No, no, no, no, no. I got some. I don't have the time. You can't ruin it for them. Brand people have time to do what? You don't have time. Nothing to do other shows.  There's movies. Maybe just I binge watch every Adam Sandler movie he's ever done.  Good for you. Except little Nicky. I haven't seen little Nicky is good people hate. I love little Nicky. Kevin Nealon has tits. Maybe we'll watch gross tits on his said. It's hilarious. We've been super under we've been doing every night we have a movie night. Oh he's a great with the kids little dude. Adam Sandler movies are.  It's the best Xoan is to this day. One of the funniest movies you ever seen in my life is Bill Marston.  Happy Gilmore. Yep. What I'm seeing was amazing. Wedding singer. Amazing Big Daddy. Yeah. Yeah. Big Daddy was great. Great. Got great fucking movies man.  Like and they, he gets hated on like The Rotten Tomatoes.  I wonder why. I don't know. I don't get it. I guess so.  Talented people want really clever, you know really great writing.  Just be entertained. You tell me Billy Massen and Happy Gilmore is not creative writing, especially at the time.  It's the thing is the kind of jokes, although they're hilarious, they're like all dick jokes. It's all like. But it's funny. That's why Brian, all I care is what's funny. Me too. I just wanna be entertained.  Dude, I howled at Happy Gilmore.  How it's it's so good. Right dude. You forget how good it is. So good. There's so many of those Bob Barker in forever.  Yeah. I haven't seen.  So did you see uncut gems with him. I haven't heard. It's great. Oh dude I heard.  It's great he blows you away in that way. That's a drama right. Drama. Yeah. He plays a serious character with the whole you just sweating the whole time. It's so intense. It's so good know.  Great movie star ready. Player one that's fucking great movie. I'm seeing that Michael Keaton who's the director.  Steven Spielberg. Spielberg if you care to the book, which I didn't ready player one of the only fiction books I've ever even bothered to go through. I listen to it. Wil Wheaton, the guy from Star Trek, reads it and he read some character voices. Fucking awesome nurdles are way different than the movie way.  Really. Movie.  Yeah, the the stuff they do like the trials, if you will. I don't want to like spoiler much because it's so different, it's so much more detailed. It's, it's, it's way awesome. I just couldn't do it in the movie because they would have had to pay for way more licenses for women.  Hey, did your boy Tom O'Neil, who wrote that Mantan book, the CIA book, did he say when they're going to come out with the documentary, the TV show of it?  No, because they still haven't decided whether or not they're going to do one single documentary or they're going to do an Amazon series like Wild West or Wild Country.  You know what they should do? A series like like our country. Or Tiger King or something? Yes, yeah, that's what they should do. Yeah, they should definitely do that. They should do it here. It's too intricate that it's too soon to so much going on with that fucking book.  That book's amazing. But that book became a New York Times bestseller after it came on the podcast. It's blown through the fucking roof. It's huge now.  It deserves it. Yeah, it's so fucking good. Yeah.  And the amount of time we put into it, I don't even think the paperback is out in twenty third, I think unless they bump it up. Right.  So the vast hardcover sold out. Fascinating. Yeah, it's a it's a really well researched and well done book, it's his life's work, man.  It's crazy to think that this guy worked on it for 20 years, 20 years on this one book.  And it started out as a magazine article for premier, not super deep. And as you started uncovering things, he's like, holy shit, it'll make you question everything with the CIA, all that stuff.  And Manson, like you got into it way before he was on the podcast. How did you find out about it?  It's very strange. I'm not obsessed, but I like Manson stuff. Really? Yeah. Why? I don't know. I thought that that whole time period, you know, in the late 60s or 70s, I like that time period, especially in Hollywood. I just got into the Manson stuff. Man, it is a weird time. And then then then somebody recommended to me like a fan. So you might dig this. One man I picked up was like, holy shit, this is good.  You know, Fitzsimons knew that guy during the entire time he was writing that book. They were next door neighbors for 20 years. What? That's how I found out about the book. Fitzsimmons does my podcast. We're hanging out and talking. He goes, hey, man. He goes, there's something you'd really be interested in. My friend Tom O'Neil wrote this book about Manson. I mean, I lost my great book about Manson. Yeah.  And then he starts talking and the more he starts talking, I'm like, what? He's like, yeah, he goes, he was part of the CIA LSD experiment where they were they were helping Manson Getsy get LSD and they were teaching him these tactics for getting these fucking hippies. And they probably did it while he was in jail and they probably dosed him. And then it turns out that those doctors with the same names as the doctors that were in the CIA LSD program also visited Manson in prison.  You know, like, holy shit, you see how much how much leeway they gave him get along, like, whatever.  He got arrested.  They let him out even while he was on parole, not violate his parole. They let him right out of jail. And every time they talked to the sheriffs of the different different cops that arrested him, like it's above my pay grade, they were told they were told to let him out.  What's instrument Manson to. He's labeled as he's possibly the most famous serial killer. Not a serial killer, though. How can they when a serial killer is never killed anybody?  Well, he definitely killed somebody. He shot a guy. He killed that one guy at the ranch that that shot a guy. Yeah. Yeah. And he directed those other people to kill people. Maybe, maybe. Well, what's interesting is that when a serial killer. No, he's not a serial killer.  No, he's he's a killer, but he's also a part of a CIA, LSD, CIA program.  All that fucking music kazinsky to the bullshit. Yeah, he was a different one. Kazinsky was a part of the Harvard LSD experiments. Yeah, they were too. They were doing a lot of wacky shit with LSD back in those days.  There's a lot of terrible things that happen to people because they don't come up with LSD and blew their brains out.  It's weird.  Manson never came out and said this like, Oh dude, I was fine until these folks came on. Give me LSD. That's fine. I was trying to fucking play with the the, you know.  Well, do you think they were the Beach Boys? I mean, back then was legitimisation like pretty legit musician to man.  Is there any music you can listen to his music. He almost got you hang with the Beach Boys.  Yes. Yeah. Brian Wilson was going to give him some sort of a contract.  And they they then his agent went down to his ranch, was like, well, this is terrible. And that's when he's like, oh, well, we're going to kill you now. We're going to kill everybody. Oh, man.  Que Madjid? No, back then, no internet. The whole hippie movement is a new thing.  Right before the sixties, the fifties, there was nothing like that. So sudden, like that's like from 2010. There's no hippies at all. And also and here we are in 2020 and hippies are everywhere. And the flower children, they're doing acid and freaking out, having sex, having sex and having orgies. You mean having a great time, Joe?  Some of us probably good time by the best of times. Don't you know Woodstock went on during a pandemic?  Yeah, you sent me that. That's now they closed down.  It was before Woodstock. Right. And they shut everything down when it hit.  Woodstock still went on. Yeah. But like the economy, everything that shut down, how long it was it was bad is more deaths than we than we have during this thing so far.  Really. Yeah. Mhm.  And the America's kind of powered through it like know like we've never seen something like this for us, like yogurt history man we have well we definitely everybody goes to 1918.  Hong Kong flu in 1968 killed one million worldwide and one hundred thousand in the U.S.. Wow.  Woodstock went on during that time. Think about all of the do together take stock during that pandemic. Dirty hippies in mud. Yeah, dirty mud and Hells Angels were there starving people and that was called the Hong Kong flu.  And then I tried to call this one the kung fu. But is it racist?  If it came from Hong Kong, did it come from a wet market? They say that's fake, right? It's created in the lab, they say, well, there's two stories. One story is, yes, it was created in the market. The other story is it was something that was in a lab and it was leaked.  What's Elon Musk say? He's my lord and savior. I didn't ask him. Oh, really? Yeah, I didn't ask him about that. We talked about the disease, but we basically talked about the infringements on civil liberties by forcing people to stay home. And he doesn't agree with any of that. But he said you should you should have the right to quarantine if you so choose to.  That's America. Yeah. Yeah, I think so, too. I'm always over by his space X, and it's it's so in a weird way, motivated.  You look at what he's built over there. I take my son Jim over there, Jeff, Folies Jim and I, we park right by it and just see the huge spaceship and the parking. And it's kind of used to be a hoodie area. It's booming over there now, man. Is it really?  Oh, where is it? A Burbank?  No, it's like Hawthorne. Yeah, Hawthorne. Right by the Hawthorne Airport made you see this, you take a right and see this huge spaceship space X, this dope building, we're talking about neural link lot yesterday.  You're talking about what neural link with that they're going to drill fucking one inch diameter hole in your head and insert something with these little wires. I'm going to go about two millimeters into your brain and they're going to juice up your fucking noggin so severely is fucked.  That's how it's going to work. So they just have a computer in your brain? Oh, yeah. You're going to be smart as fuck.  And he goes underneath that. This is what Elon said.  You're not going to have to talk anymore. Not going to have to talk anymore one day. No need to talk anymore. Well, how are we going to communicate through our brains? Oh, God, I tune into each other with the universal language going to be robots. I mean, the robots, Elon.  I don't know yet. Elon, don't create this shit. Did aliens. We're going to become aliens. Oh, that's look, one of the thing he said, we're talking about artificial intelligence. It was like, if you can't beat them, join them. Look, that's what it's going to look like.  There's a hole in your fucking head, bro.  That's what I'm signing up for that first. Me? No. First in line.  Fuck it. Let's get the latest version.  Started talking to people. I'm going to put out podcast. Just lie in there and just think and then you're going to receive it.  What a nightmare. What's the point?  Well, the point of this, first of all, initially is to heal injuries. He said we're going to be able to take people with spinal cord injuries, even quadriplegic.  Yes, all those things, everything, brain damage, Alzheimer's. And you're going to. But the thing is about people that are injured that can't move. You're basically going to have new things that move your muscles where your spinal cord doesn't work anymore.  And he goes in and ultimately it'll work even better.  I got better. He goes, yes, better. So to work better than your own fucking spinal cord and your own nerves and your reactions, your movement, sports are going to be insane.  Yeah, I don't want a dude who's got like a catastrophic neck injury and they go, we've got good news and bad news. Bad news is you have catastrophic tropica neck injury. You're paralyzed from the neck down. The good news is we're going to install neural link and your body is going to work way better than it ever worked. You're just going to have to bypass the regular nerves with these synthetic nerves. And we're going to install everything. It's going to take about 16 hours on the operating table and you're going to get out.  You're going to be able to jump over buildings.  Yeah, but you know that first that first versions can be like the cell phone system. Some blocky thing.  We I can ask her, you know. Yeah.  For me, man, I'm not for you right now. But just like you don't want to carry that brick that fucking homeboy had in Wall Street in your pocket.  Remember the Michael Douglas brick? Yeah. I don't want that in your pocket now. I'm going to wear that thing out. But look, all those years later, look what we got. Right, legally, right. That is so nice. Right?  That's what it's going to be in the beginning. It's going to be some stupid thing you got you got to wear a football helmet everywhere.  But you could see the moon. You can read people's minds, but you have, you know, some fucking big bulky thing in your head, like a motorcycle helmet or something.  I'll probably be dead. But for my kids to wear.  No, no, I don't think you will be. He's talking about five years.  He's talking about the implementation of this stuff, that something like a trillion dollars, I don't think it will be met, but I think the thing that you have to worry about is the haves and the have nots is never going to be a bigger distinction between haves and have nots to when you have this neural link that literally turns you into a super cyborg and the people that are poor have no access to that.  So he's like he was sort of saying, look, you know, you're going to have access to so much more productivity. You're going to be able to get so much more accomplished during your time. It's going to be so different.  And he's creating this. He's making it. Why do you want to do this?  Celan I don't think he can help himself. When you talk to the I said if you can't beat them, join them.  Well I also think his brain is so different than our brains. When you're sitting there talking to him, I think he's he's trying to talk to me. The way I talk to a three year old like a three year old is trying to talk to him about a drawing they made. And I'm like, oh, OK, cool. So is that a house that the house right there or is that, you know, your daddy? Oh, OK.  The on a daily basis, how is the worst he's off.  I'm always surprised that he talks to me whenever I text. I'm always surprised he text me back. And then when it's Elon Musk, I know when I'm sitting down with him like whose idea was it for him to come on?  Well, he was tweet a bunch of crazy shit about which I love getting rid of his houses. And did he explain why he wants to get rid of his house?  Yeah, he said that it's an attack vector. The fact that he has so much possessions and he's so wealthy people. Oh, you're a billionaire. You have so many things going, OK, I'll get rid of everything.  I won't have anything. Then what what do you say then? We got to have somewhere to rent.  It's going to rent. It's going to rent a house.  I come to what he told me. Listen to people do you're fucking billionaire become a supervillain.  Do you think he was tweeting shit like Free America now?  Yeah. I love this. And I loved it. I did too. Everybody's going nuts and, you know, people mad at him. People were agreeing with him. And so I saw Mike.  I guarantee you, he probably wants to say yeah.  And he also wants an opportunity to express himself freely where someone and there's not a lot of places where he can just do that. And so I said, I love it. I just sent a text.  You never want to come on talk. I go, you have an open invitation. Was he like he goes, one would be good for you. Does he writing code?  No, really. Just the text messages while he's a fun guy, man, I really enjoyed. He didn't smoke weed this time. No, I told him we could leave the weed alone. We drank. We had some. Oh did he drink. He always drinks. Oh wow. Yeah.  So we. We talked, it must be tough for him. Yeah, he's so smart. The only reason why he didn't come in the day before yesterday is his kid was born. Well, that's right. Yeah. So he left the hospital, went home, came right here. Gangster.  Yeah. Oh, it's always been a fan. Even when he didn't have here.  Always a fan got those plugs on to work to come up. He's a high level high level player.  Elon Musk plugs man he spent good money. I don't get why Trump and LeBron will figure it out. Elon can.  Yeah, well, LeBron, first of all, just shaves said yes. And Trump, first of all, just shave your head, I imagine.  Trovan, if I compare, I swear to God, if I could grow hair and shave my head, I'm I don't know if you draw like that.  Jesse Stamos.  I'll come on my head, dude. I like the way I look bald. You're cool. I do. I do like it. I like the low maintenance of it. I used to have a hairdresser that I went to for years and she's nice and I miss her. She's cut my hair. We had good conversations. That's it. That's all I miss about having hair. Yeah. Shampoo and and all that hair on you. The two men back in the early days, that shit started going on.  Yeah.  And then the Propecia is not good for the pecker.  Brian begs to differ. He says it's harder on it. I don't so said who knows with Brian.  It's so far so hard to figure out. You got to decipher to the madness yourself, like so crazy.  And Brian is shaving his head too. Now he's just taking it in steps. That's all I.  I go back to the road. He's like, no, no, no, I'm it's a matter of time.  But for now he got it really short and now he's letting it grow a little longer. It's like it's engraft looking like shit. Father Time is his barber. Yeah dude. Let it go by. Sit down. Sit down. Do don't be scared.  People dig the short hair on Brian. It's so low maintenance.  That's what I like about being bald every like four or five days I take the Clippers, I fucking work and I try to convince Jamie because Jamie can't get a haircut because there's no barber here.  She looks nice down bro. Now who she looks flowing when you go outside, you got to put on like sunscreen and that you wear a hat everywhere you go, somewhere you want to go.  Right now there's maintenance. I'm saying, hey dude, my my my hair. My hair was down to hear my hair is down to here. And then I got on the trails.  I'm hot. I used to buzz down when you thought, oh yeah. You see it just low maintenance.  Yeah. Because, you know, I mean I was like, look in the mirror fix.  I'm like, what the fuck am I doing that's shaved. Yeah. When you're fighting, you can't be thinking about. I see you. She is trying to convince my son to shave it to. It's like he's not shaving his head. Looks like a little Navy seal and shave.  It's cute as fuck dude.  I got to convince him not to touch fuckin rattlesnakes man. Oh yeah. He doesn't understand. I kept showing him videos because I show him the videos before I show you guys. I'll show him when I get home. I saw another rattlesnake and he has this false confidence, right. He goes, I'm the first guy in the world. Are you the first guy in the world that cops can help you when you get older? But right now, he is on the fast.  In the world of you. You are fast. You're not fast in snake. Yes. Yes, I am telling you, not fast in the snake. I go, Are you following me? Yes. Yes, I know. All right.  Well, let's say you're a little faster than me. We're not as fast as this. And I'll play a video of a snake striking. You're not that fast. Here's the knife fucking I chop it chop.  You don't chop it. So I've been shown just like you it dynamite. Yeah. I just I saw some horrible videos of snakes, horrible videos and it's just not getting through his head.  So now I tell you know his the, the lady who watched him during the day if I'm at work or his mom like if he goes outside so us go first. If you're a rattlesnake you get him the fuck out of there because he's really I think he's faster.  Oh, my God, I'm a fast boy.  I did.  I got admire the confidence. I know it's going to pay off when he's older, if he gets in sports. But right now, just get bit first.  Oh, dude. Nightmare. Oh my God.  I guess I guess there's rattlesnakes out. You can buy people can send me watching by where the snake can't get through it.  Huh. It must be Kevlar.  I don't I have no idea. But yeah, it's got to be the same material they use for knife proof vest and shit like that.  Dude, I'm going, I'm going mountain biking. This guy Joe, he's a he's a specialized pro and I mean him go on the trails. And that's why I've been trying so hard because I know I'm going to go with him. So I want to try and see what I'm up to with this project.  Know pretty nuts. So you're designing.  I'm training. Yeah. I go to sleep if I go to sleep and I'll go through the trail in my head, just like when I was fighting. Go through my head. I'm obsessed with it, man. Mountain biking nuts. Right.  How did that happen to contain it out of nowhere. A glacier downhill thing. Yes. Yeah. Where's that. It's in like France. You go to the top of a glacier and you go all the way down. That's the thing we've seen a few times where everybody. Oh, that looks terrifying. That's that's the one when you go over that ridge and the left and the right is that different thing.  That's just fun. That's just fun trails.  What's what's weird about me is I like to suffer a little. I like I like going up the hills, Matt. I like when it's steep, if I can have sometimes my quads will get so pumped of blood, I have to get off and walk and there's I have this weird triggermen. I'm like, fuck, yeah, dude. And the sun's beating down. There might be a rattlesnake. I'm just like, fuck, I'm going. I just love it.  Well, it's no pounding too.  That's the great thing is you're getting cardio without beating the fuck out of your joints.  I'm getting I'm getting lean, dude. I'm losing weight on it. Oh. Was doing this every day. Every day. How many miles today. I did twenty four miles. Wow.  Yeah dude that's real dude.  It's that funny to when you get a flat you're 24 miles out, you fix it and fix it. Some of these are, some of these are tubeless but I'm not a fix it really. Yeah. Tubeless tubeless tubeless tires. So where, where if they get a flat there's a there's a liquid in that fills the hole but sometimes too bad like at my chains broke.  Don't fix it. You fix to fix my chain. Well are you going to do this. I don't even know you anymore.  I know it's for chains like when when you first got into hunting weren't you obsessed with it. Yes, that I am right now with biking it. It's weird dude. That's interesting. It's very weird.  Like the thick boy bike. That is a joke at first. But then all these people just started by I mean hundreds and thousands of messages of people on their bikes. I was like, we had a real fucking club here, big boy, you should do it.  Like, you know, Kevin Hart does those things where he has, like, these races. That's what I'm doing to gets together. That's what I'm doing. Joe, where's the Thick Boy Bike Club going to meet?  Well, when I once we go back to normal, every city I go into that Saturday, we're meeting at their top trail. Come on. That's what I'm doing, dude. So you're going to do a Kevin Hart? I'm doing a Kevin Hart, but with bikes now, I like it.  I like it because everyone everyone can relate to, you know, bikes.  People are going to fall and break their fucking necks right in front of my insurance. That's like that's why you can't charge them to be part of it. Oh, right. Then it's like we met here. It's like Boy Bike Club. But, yeah, you're on your own. We're all riding together, man.  No liability. Wow. I like it. Hey, man, it's a great activity for cardio and the biking can be so positive. I have so many people reaching out to me specialized. You know, all these people just, you know, it's not stupid.  Wow. It's insane. It's one of the best things to happen on this continent. Holy fuck. When I say I love it, man, literally, I close my eyes. But the night before I go through the entire trail, what is Coulon think about all this?  He said, Well, I'll post bikes all the time. Like, get on the go, please quit posting your bike. Why does he get upset by it?  I think just fucking around, but he just I don't know, you know, where are we going to move him out of Venice.  Who's telling me about the homeless problem? He's got near his place. His place is dope, man. You know, I grew up investing in the summer, so Venice is in my heart and I love Venice.  But there's always been a bum problem. We went to Feliks that fucking dope restaurant, and I love that place. And as we're passing this on, the left is a beautiful house by a five million dollar house.  At least it's right in front of it. There's ten tents. I was like, this is crazy. Yeah.  This guy is literally across the street from a homeless encampment. Now he's got this gorgeous house.  The tough thing is, again, I love Venice when my favorite place on earth, if not my favorite, the prom is do you want to raise a family? Like, I don't want my son being around that. You know, it's just there's so much homelessness. I know it's weird.  And Brian sent us that article about how it's essentially just devastating real estate prices.  Fucking they don't know what to do when people have no idea what to do or how to fix it. There's I don't know, it's only growing.  I know now that I'm so into biking, I'm only going to live in either Palisades, Malibu or Woodland Hills where we're at. So because the mountains there. So when I go over, I go to Palisades, Malibu, I'm in Woodland Hills galvanises.  Well, I'm only living there.  Those are great choices, especially Malibu. The air over there is fantastic. You get in that ocean air, no smog. It just blows right from the ocean.  So, you know, this is my neighbor, so.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. He loves it. He loves it.  It's a great place to live in terms of like air quality. And, you know, it's nice, nice places, great places. You can surf bike ride.  My kid goes to school over there so I can to figure it out.  Might be the move. Yeah. Might be the move. I love where we're at them.  Yeah. Well, you know, I mean California is good in terms of whether there's a lot of great people here.  We have a lot of great friends here, but best restaurants if that's comedy club, best comedy club. Two best comedy clubs. Yeah. La Hoya and the store in Hollywood. Yeah, the best comedy club.  And The Improv was great too. I love the improv and I was upside down. Yeah, that's just killing it.  The real question is what's everything going to be like when everything reopens and what happens if we get a second wave if we get locked down again, if this governor thinks you can lock everything down again, even after we've shown, look, if the statistics come out and what Ellen said was true, that the death rate, when it appears to be, is far lower than anybody anticipated. If this guy still thinks they're going to lock everything down again in a few months, if we get a second wave, he can eat shit.  People aren't going to put up with it, man. People going to leave. They're going to leave the state. I don't even already people aren't going to put up with it. And but, yeah, they're going to leave. But I also just think they're not going to put up with it.  Well, it could be very bad for him politically if he continues to go down this route because it's devastating to the economy. You've got to give people that I like when people need to make their own decision. Yes. And I like when people are revolting against it. There's something I don't know what it is I'm getting. There's something about them. I'm like, fuck, yeah, dude.  And where they're revolting is all the Republican areas. And it makes sense on Newport Beach, but also makes it all the time out there. There's he wanted to shut down. Yeah, he does that. Not weird. It is weird. San Diego you guys. Ventura say Democrat but Republican beach is shut down. The fuck are you doing. What is that. And then those people at the beach. Swint not happening. Why do you think he did that?  Do you think he did that politically? Because they are a Republican town has to have.  Why else would you do so gross if that's what he did? It's just a scare. Tactics are disgusting in general. It is really a foul. The most foulness. It's so greasy.  Yeah. When we could read each other's minds, we won't need those cunts. No, we really won't. Just there should be established rules that we all follow. What you need is that you need the military. You need someone to watch over the military to see that they don't fucking go out of control and try to take over like China. You've always said it best.  You need a committee. Yeah, but Elon Musk on that fucking committee, I need a guy who can stats.  But Elon, on there, you need a large group of people, not one person.  And they need to be they need to have exhibited the fact they're objective and reasonable and ethical and moral.  You can't just have a popularity contest. No, it's not. It's just too stupid. Yeah, if we're if there's going to be like an uprising in, you know, cases and if they shut down again, I would probably have to leave word for word.  Would you go to Texas? I think I think all of us should talk. Yeah, I think all of us should talk. Everybody has money. We should all talk, go to one place and go to that comedy club and fuckin rock that house. That would be every fucking night.  I'd be crazy. And we still do podcasts and we're getting on each other's shows. I'm down, I'm 100 percent down. Yeah, let me check with Callen. Yeah, he's down. If there's an earthquake, that's when everyone's really going to understand that we're in a bad spot.  Yeah, well, taxes should help you understand you in a bad spot to the taxes are insane. They are crazy to pay for. Right.  Well, that's what so many people moved to Nevada. You know, Nevada gets 60000 people a year from California. Yeah. Denver got a shitload of them to 60000.  A large number, 60000 people moving into Nevada every year. And that's it.  Dana and I were talking about the political atmosphere of Nevada and that their governors is Democrat.  And a lot of the reasons why they used to be really a red state and they're not anymore. And a lot of reasons why are all the people that are popping in from California. Interesting.  Yeah, but they don't have state taxes, so it's a great place to try to save some money.  But you live in Nevada? Um, I don't think so.  Yeah. I'd rather go to Texas or Florida without those state taxes. Yeah, I wouldn't mind Reno. I wouldn't mind like living in Tahoe up on the mountains areas.  I'd be Mountstuart Mountain biker, but.  But Vegas. Hmm. Vegas is tough. I hate Vegas. I live inside the devil's balls. I just. I don't know what I mean. We could perform there. I don't know. Yeah. I love your idea of doing residency in L.A.. You do it. Not me. You do. Yes. It's a brilliant idea.  That's the that's the solution to travel. I don't tell people where I am. You can do it, though.  Yeah. Like the like a decent sized theater, like the larger or something like that. Yeah, something around every Friday. Every Friday night. Yeah. I mean shows you do at the Comedy Store and at the Improv.  Yeah. Mean you go through the tickets. That's a lot of people. Yeah. Thousands.  Yeah. Every week dude. Yep.  Hey who's who's not going to fly the LHC and do the Largo every Friday. Yeah. I'm kind of already doing it right. I'm already doing it. Doing it at the Comedy Store in the Improv when everything was up and running. But yeah I would do something like that and it's not a bad idea and maybe like do that and then tour occasionally.  Yeah. And when I tour like I'm touring once a month, you know, but I have a lot of dates coming up and I look, I have dates coming up in October and I don't even know if I'm gonna be able to do them. You know, like I've got Madison Square Garden almost sold out, Boston Garden almost sold out.  You're doing Macerich? I don't know.  But I bet you October 3rd, I bet you it's 18000 people. If you got 18000 people, what are the rules?  Do you have to have only 9000 people?  You have to everybody is like the you have to have the Ray Romano used to have the I'm not a homo joke about going to the theater with your buddy. You have to have the two of you.  I'm not a whole to eat, but think how fast you know, we talk all the shit about open up, but think how fast things are moving now.  You think about July. Yeah, but summer real bad. New York City still looks bad. And you know what?  The other thing about the decline, though. Yeah, it is on the clouds. But I'm worried about New York in terms of people moving out of New York. I think people are going to realize how preposterous it is to be stacked on top of your insane say, yeah, Fien figured out yet.  I mean, this is going to be a big wake up call for them because you said it's in October.  Yes. Meant New York in third August.  Dude, things will be booming. I hope Trump to me pumping fucking money in three months from now, though, and it's three months.  This shit just started two months ago, but the fastest rolling dude is it.  Things are kind of on the run now for the last month and a half, but the states are ahead of us.  Remember, Newsom's a goddamn cocksucker, so he's holding things back.  But other states, a real start dropping like flies. Two weeks in Atlanta. We're going to have cowboy shows. If it's one of your boys, play that game up there.  There's going to be places we're going to be allowed to go for sure.  But there's going to be I get message every day, do Spokane ticket sales. But I'm I haven't promoted it. I'm so Pamona because I'm like, I don't know, man. Yeah, it's me.  I first think Boys by club get together that Saturday morning.  Are you going to do that every time every city I go to now you don't think you going to get bored with this biking shit now?  I don't think so. I'm obsessed with it. But there's got to be some places don't even have bike trails.  Well, like Florida probably going to pass. You're going to get bit by alligator, 100 percent. New Orleans probably pass.  Dopey lady in. Was it Louisiana? She got bit by an alligator.  She's trying to take a picture with it. It's like get closer to him and the alligator ater it just sader.  It's on camera.  I don't think it's I can't get enough of that. It's our camera. But, you know, it's pretty rare that an alligator attacks and kills a person.  People think I'm close to the rattlesnakes when I post a picture of them, but or the video of them. But I zoom in. I'm not. You get my bike. So it's between me and the rattlesnake.  Usually it's just run over its head, flatten out, hold onto it. Yeah.  But then I thought someone sent me a video of a guy running over one in it, you know, even though he ran over it so big it turned back and bit his fucking calf. Really. Yeah.  Even though I was like oh beat his ass. Oh I could see that happen. Yes. Yeah.  Some boys, I think they, they flex, they flex all that muscle in there.  Well he probably tried to be a pussy and run over the back of it, you know, at first. Oh that fucking crushes talking heads wit how dark they are man. Wow man. They're a dangerous creature I've ever seen one dragging a rabbit.  It's not that they're monsters. My this is fast. It's not good.  It's a nightmare. How old is he? Like four. Four. No fast boy in the world. Yeah. Dude, you keep saying that man. And he is he's the fast four year old you have seen before. Year olds aren't rattlesnakes.  Dude, it's hilarious. He's he's big old cards he got from his mama. He's all shredded.  It's hilarious. Fast boy in the world. All right, man.  Some kids are just jacked when they're young and you realize that life isn't fair. You look at some kids and they look at the literally made out of marshmallows like marshmallows covered by a thin.  It's a bummer. Thin skin.  It's like, did you see that that five year old that stole the car to go buy a Lamborghini? You want this five year old stole the car, and when you see me like, well, that's the biggest five year old in the world, he's probably I don't know how he's so fat.  Look at him. They put a weird thing over his face. Oh, so you can't see you can't see him.  But there's video of his family talking. They're all thick as fuck.  And he stole this car because mom told me he can have a Lamborghini, five year old driving an SUV on a Utah freeway.  And then he goes, I'm going to California, buy a Lamborghini. And then how much money have you guys have? Three parts of my wallet solidness.  They spotted the vehicle driving thirty five miles an hour and swerving. This five year old is just driving on the highway. That's what a confident kid he pulled over.  And not bad and not bad for a five year old.  And he's got his foot on the brakes. Just how crazy how old are you? Five. You're five years old. Wow.  His sister fell asleep while she's babysitting, so he just stole a car.  Yeah, because I guess because his mom left work, he's like, can I have a Lamborghini Chiquitita to fucking mine now?  He's like three dollars with him and he was going to buy a Lamborghini. This is like a Will Ferrell movie.  It's insane. But not bad for a five year old to see that big baby to that meme that was going around with this gigantic baby, it's about three years old, I think. What?  Yeah, look at that thing. He looks creepy as shit.  That's a that's like a dolt pretending to be even weird kid.  God damn it is thick. Jesus Christ. Yeah. Giant, this giant baby never really ends well for him, does it? Well, it doesn't end well for giants. Mom of Big Baby tells Hater's he's actually healthy mom. It was started going around the NFL draft, just like this is the next NFL like lineman who might be a giant might be.  Did you see all that shit where Adele was getting crap for losing weight?  People are starting to shift losing weight. Fat girls, of course. How dare you girl used to be a representative of those fat fucks. That's a plus sized models.  Oh, God. They're saying that this shouldn't be that this shouldn't define beauty standards and that losing weight and being thin shouldn't be crazy.  That is fucking crazy. That is. You mean Adele got healthy and you fat folks want to stuff your face with pizza and get covid and blame it on us? They also want to pretend they're still beautiful.  It's crazy, even though there is some some chubby chasers like that second sloppy fuck did that on Adele for being disciplined, finally get their shit together, quitting fish and chips. I want that plus size model thing to carry over to men.  I'm waiting for men to decide that these abs and six packs and ripped muscles and this is she can't define beauty standards. This is this, this is how good I look.  I look good with a gut aliments ever going to happen. It's not going to happen. Not only that, there'd be no support. There would be no you go boy, start that club.  There's a lot of fat girls that get you go girl, you are beautiful. You're beautiful. Show courageous.  Oh, you're so brave. You're so amazing. Don't worry guys.  They're wrong. They're wrong. Guys aren't like that the way they're they're picking on you.  Yeah. It's the war from when the Marvel Comics when he drank a lot of beer. Yeah. He lost the weight real quick in that scene though, remember. Couple scenes later, he's thin again. Did you see that movie using on Netflix? No. Good, Andy Stop said it fucking sucked and he said it is so unrealistic because, you know, Andy is a legitimate seal.  He said it's 100 percent horseshit, although Andy likes Fast and Furious shot and lives through you like Fast and Furious on a street race car driver.  Yeah, but that shit, the other jumping are all right from building to building. Andy. Wow. And they got the rock holding the helicopter by a chain.  But then this is real. That's why you don't enjoy this business. Come on, dude, I get it a little bit. I watch fight moves and I get this, like warrior watch Rocky.  How about Warrior? That stupid movie, the Callum's and I fight two days in a row. I don't want to watch it. It makes you mad when they fight two days in a row. I'm like, hey, hey, hey. Do you ever talk to a guy a day after he had a fucking cage fight ahead? Looks like a watermelon. Everything's sore. You barely can walk. The idea that you're going to fight two days in a row.  So stupid. That's Hollywood shit. It's such Hollywood shit. They think they're smarter than everybody.  They're going to rewrite things and for dramatic effect with uncut gems you're talking about earlier, there's like three points.  Shut the fuck up. Like three big plot points that people say are real.  Please don't ruin it for me. I'm going to watch it, please. It's still a great movie. Please stop. Please. Right. Fantastic movie. Don't ruin show you. I know you don't. I know you hate it. I know you hate other sports. You got to watch the last dance on ESPN. Jamie, we talked about that.  I know you don't you don't just definitely watch because it doesn't really get into the X's and O's, the basketball just from a sheer personality greatness of Michael Jordan. I like. Holy fuck, dude.  Yeah, it's insane. It's insane. Yeah. He was a madman. He was a madman. Yeah. Straight up Mad Men punch doesn't stick her in the face. Gambling addict.  Just, you know, when they're when they're in the Olympics, you know, they're practicing and they're all the best. Guys were on one team. He was on one thing would like the B side and they got up by six and so on. Talk shit. And he's like, excuse me. And then took over. And they're like, holy fuck.  But they said he was nasty about it. Like he's just the ultimate winner. You watch. This is insane, dude.  And then like the just the pressure, like he hated the negative, the like because, you know, he came out, he was a gambling guy and so on and all the negativity got. And one of the reasons retired from that negativity. Yeah. You're like, oh dude, if you thought that was a negative thing about the players, now deal with social media.  Oh, yeah. That's one of the reasons why people respect LeBron James so much in comparison. I mean, he's dealing with the worst aspects of social media, you know, the social media and it's hate still gets it done.  Think about John Jones. All the shit John gets. Right? He brings it himself.  Yeah. You like you're fucked. He'll get arrested, right?  Whatever. Shooting, whatever gun he's shooting.  And he's like, hang out with bums at 4:00 in the morning. Next day, let's have everybody shooting arrows, don't you? Fuck. See, you make whatever it is. It's like, all right, dude. Well, he definitely bounces back easy.  It's interesting. Like some people get devastated by bad press. Some people just let it roll right off their back. John's roll right off the bat, guy. What else do you do lay down? Because, you know, because he's he's the creator of this madness, but he's still just like he had it. All right.  Yeah, well, he's a risk taker. That's why he's such a great fighter.  And, you know, when you're a risk taker, you fuck up, make mistakes.  Yeah, you're right. I mean, that's part of what it is.  I mean, I always point to the fact that the guy opened up that fight with Shogan youngest guy ever to win. The title opens up with a flying knee against a legend, not who does that?  Well, not as an but what is crazy is when you're fighting cock up on the same court, opened up with a head kick. That's right. And Murka went like this and smiled at me. Was like you, what the fuck are you doing?  It's like, yeah, you're right. That's disrespectful. Well, you won, though. Yeah, I did. When I after you knocked him out due to my crazy win. Yeah. My biggest win. Am I crazy to think Dominick Cruz can beat Henry who don't decision.  Dominic Cruz is a legitimate bantamweight. Henry who don't beat Mahlum arise but Mahlum arise it seemed like kind of fell apart, got tired and fell apart.  Broke He broke them down.  Dominic Cruz. We haven't seen it, he doesn't yet have carpet fight, but, yeah, but he got real emotional with COGAT Brown fight. We don't know where he's at physically. He just got off another surgery. He's thirty six thirty seven now, which is old for a 135 pound fighter.  Very old. But you guys are fucking his movement.  DeWinter man and Hennesy will start slow. I see him getting down in rounds to Dominick Dunne.  It's impossible to hit man and his movement is pretty substantial. That's a big factor. If there's a weird to it's awkward.  His wrestling style switch in the feet. If it's dumb and kind of that fashion. I don't know, man. It's a tough fight for Minnesota.  Well, Dominick Cruz is a tough fight for everybody, is not an easy fight for anybody.  And also, you know, I mean, he's got to realize there's not a whole lot more opportunities left now his age.  If he wins this one, there are if he loses it, it's kind of like, yeah, if he loses it, it's over. Just be an analyst for a little bit. But he's great at that. The best. He's. Yeah, one of the best. Yeah.  He's for sure. One of my favorites. My favorites. You Anick in D.C. though.  Well we may in D.C. have a fun time and we get silly. Well this is one of the guys. Yeah. This is I guess. Yeah. Yeah. DC texted me the other day. He's, he's like one of the guys.  Yeah. He gets silly. He's getting mad waiting around for steep you know.  But I think, I think it's a disservice to DC. I love Steep and he has the issue in these times. I can in a cage where guys are freaking out, it's like dude if you're not going to fight then we got to figure something out because I think the UFC gave him some sort of an ultimatum.  I would imagine that's what he said. Oh, did he? Yeah.  Yeah, there was an article about it today. There's there's some sort of some sort of a discussion.  Well, what I don't want is Stieber to come back too soon. He's not ready and lose that fight, you know, ruin a little bit of his legacy. Yeah, dude, wait it out.  Get that. I better let these guys do the thing, then they come back. Hmm.  Yeah. I don't know if he's ever going to be able to fight again and maybe he shouldn't. You know, the I it's not worth it.  He's a great. Yeah. Whatever he does is still great.  He got poked quite a bit. Not that first fight. We watched that first fight. He got poked back in the eyes, first fight with DC.  I don't know if that's where the injury came from, but could have been gone unnoticed. I don't see DC jumping out of bed to fight Frances. Fuck that.  I think have step backs off and says, I'm done. You know, my eyes are too precious. I think D.C. retires.  Agree. Unless they come up with some sort of wild 205 pound fight for him that allows him to make that cut again, dude, and then how long is France going to reign as the champion who know?  And then John goes up there with a frozen strike wins.  Yeah, you're talking malarkey right now. I'm not just kidding. What do you think?  We could easily what do you think the odds of that fight are?  I would say look at one three to one, three to one, because they're basing off the overinflate, which is a bad idea to do in the first place.  But remember, they set lines to get movement. They want you to bet on them. Yeah, I would say three to one.  Hmm. Because they're basing off the overinflate return about two different game plans, which M-m math and maybe betting is insane. Yeah, insane. I have no idea what the guy's feeling at night.  Like like Sironi to you know, to the point we all I think in the media, especially American media, we all went to one to one to one underdog and a three to one favorite, other three to one minus two years ago, we all went pretty hard on Stephen Smith, like you went hard on. I went home. We were like, shut the fuck are we talking about with dance running?  Then don't come down. Was like just wasn't there that night.  Yeah, but he always says that when he loses, you know, I think Donald gets real nervous and I think it's always been it was warm though.  It was a big event. And I think the overwhelming pressure of those big events was bad in the Petis fight is bad in the half all the Sandro's fight. When he gets to that, yeah, he gets pretty tippity top where it's the chance of a lifetime.  And so Stephen Smith right now, because he didn't quit, he got fucked up. I mean, it wasn't did he say cowboy was nervous as fuck?  Yeah, I thought he said he didn't show up, which is a fair assessment, even though he's not from the sport, which is insane to say that he's a hot guy.  So him saying didn't show up and then Colby was on it, show up like a little and he asked for an apology from everybody in the Miami community.  It's the way Stephen Smith did. Please. It's the way the disrespect.  Yeah. Because you're not from the sport. Right.  And he's talking about it the same way you would talk about someone who misses a free throw. It's not the same.  Yes. Connotation is just it didn't vibe well with the actual fans, but they brought him in to do Stephen Smith stuff.  They just did this. Yeah. I mean, that's why he's he's popular because he makes those bold statements. So it makes nine million dollars a year from SBN.  That's what it is. Yeah. That's why in terms of sports, the same thing. It was like, how dare you?  The sport, it requires a different perspective. It also is a sport that they know if you're a real fan, they don't want regular sports guys. They don't want you jumping over here. They you can be a regular sports guy, but you've got to be a real fan of the pretty hardcore to get in the game.  Yeah, that's what they prefer because there's enough people out there that are talking about it on a regular basis that are hardcore fans of it, that are really good, like Luke Thomas, guys that are hardcore fans of it, but that have real objective takes where they're analyzing it from a perspective of knowledge.  Oh dude, I love The Partridge Family. I love I love his YouTube show. He's one of my favorites. Yeah, it's very good. No, it's just I love me. I Luke do a show before big fights. We didn't do it this time. But he's on such the other spectrum when it comes to covid. He's so terrified of things is the worst thing ever. We shut down everything and I see I'm all the way the fuck over here.  So I did the show before. I'm like, do let's not let's not do the covid thing, but you can't help it pop up.  So it's just just one of those things. What does he think these thinks? It's like we shouldn't like the UFC having a fight and saying, I don't know who he's at now. I don't I don't misquote him. I know before when they're and put the one on California, he was like, absolutely not any other sport be shit on. But the media doesn't care. The media doesn't care about the UFC. They shouldn't be doing this where I'm I think they should be doing it.  I think they should have the fight in California if Newsom's bitch don't come in and stop it.  But without, you know, with precautions, why is it such a big deal? I don't know.  I don't misquote Luke, but if they're testing everybody and I'll tell you what happened to me, I had to get a nose swab, which is weird. Weird man. Doesn't feel terrible having one.  And, you know, it it they dig around there and then they pull it out. I mean, like gets way up to the top of your nose.  It feels weird because it doesn't it it's irritating but it stays irritating for a long time, stays irritating for like fifteen minutes after it's over.  That better than the prick. Oh the pricks. Nothing. You don't even feel it. No, I'm saying I did the prick but it's nothing. But is it the testing better. It's now it's active.  It's the active bacteria or the active virus rather. Um whereas the other one is just testing the antibodies and the other one they can tell whether or not you have a current infection or you recovered from an infection. But this is like are you sick with it right now. So I did that and it was negative. My antibodies were negative. Everything is negative. I don't have it. But you could do that with everybody.  These aren't it's not these New York is doing that, though, right? This is the thing. It's not like these tests are hard to get anymore. Right. There was a point in time, the beginning of this outbreak two months ago was very difficult to get these tests. Now it's not you get these tests, you get the results back fairly quickly, very quickly. Fifteen minutes for the antibody test. It takes a day or so with the nose swab.  You can test everybody, so you test everybody. Why is that hard? If everybody's negative, let them fight. It's not if you're talking about healthy people. I do that. That's irresponsible foolishness.  It's unbelievable.  And plays basketball because even if they had the. These fucking guys aren't even showing any symptoms. Dude, how about baseball? The motherfuckers are, you know, far apart.  Baseball players are get back to work, MLB, you know how far away they are from each other. Yes. Get back to work. Yes. Damn it.  Yeah, it's listen, it's not what everybody thought it was going to be. Everybody thought it was going to be like the Spanish flu or the fucking black plague. It's not how we thought. How about how about.  Dana said reporters called in and complained to the newsroom to the government and that's why it got shut down. Reporters, that's the word. And he has a list. Am I right on that, Jamie? I heard that.  I started to check the quote. These fucking haters are like, how can you do this? And called in the newsrooms, like, how can we do this? And then that's why they got stopped.  So that's why he said, Pussy, the pussy media.  You know, I'd love to hear that list. I wonder to see.  But the objective of the of the people back then, a month ago was different. The public's perspective, the information, the more the information comes in, the better things look, you know, the the worse it looks.  If you're a fan of someone in your family died or your grandma died or I understand that. But the more the data comes in, the more it looks like it's not nearly as deadly.  You get open your eyes. All the information in as many as 70 percent of the people that get it are asymptomatic, which is just bonkers.  Right. And then young, healthy people, it's off the charts, but just people in general do something that's like ninety eight point seven.  Yeah, people that are just fine. Yeah. Yeah, it's weird. It's a weird disease.  Take my chances. Yeah. But I'm pretty sure Dana was saying, here's the list of those fucks who called in and what are you going to do about that by some other. I don't know. Every does people making Lokman Instagram. It's kind of funny.  I can't believe you blocked me. Do I'll try to talk to you this weekend. Come on. I'm me. Maybe I got a request. So pay per view over here like a motherfucker for you. Man, I know you are right. That's what's crazy. Well, the thing is, I go hard on the pain control.  You you're too independent. I know, but it's a good thing because I know.  But but the show especially see when you and him started tangling your show was not nearly as successful as it was now as it is now, which is really kind of funny, because if he had just like bury the hatchet with you back then you'd be an ally.  It would be helpful. She could come on the show, could all pump up the pay per view, would be great for everybody.  But you guys are getting millions of views. It's a different world now. Like now. The show is bigger than anything. It's on ESPN by far, and they don't bigger than anything. UFC has combined all their shows. I beat all of them and I still ride or die for them. Give you a bloody boat over here. Twenty four and again.  And the show keeps growing. That's growing crazier. See, when you don't have a connection to a network like it's basically a meritocracy.  Like if the show's good people tune in and more people tune in, the more fun, the more they like it, the more they enjoy it, the bigger the more realness. Yeah, well it's not overproduced and someone's in your ear and you got an agenda.  Someone's censoring you that's holding you back and slowing you down. Take it easy, sharp. You got to stop calling girls bitches you got.  But I have a good way. She's a bitch. I know it's a bad sign. Peace. So speaking of which, is Rachel Österreich going to fight Paige Van Zandt?  How many people are going to be watching that fight with are backing off this guy that's going to be the most watched fight ever? Yeah, and they're talking about a two like page had it on her that it's going to be the hottest fight ever.  Ever. Yeah, the two of them together.  And and Rachel, all stivic is wearing a fucking fur coat in the stare down just to die emesis.  Make that a pay per view, man.  I don't want Paige to lose any weight though when she's off thick like that. So much good so so much healthier. Do you see her husband.  Dude, he tapped out boogie man. I was super impressed. I said a monster. I sent him a message on Instagram. I like to do not only that, his fucking explosive takedown defense or his submission defense was insane. Insane the way he exploded out of things. I was very impressed. That's Simmons thing, right? Yes. Yeah. Very impressed with his submission, though.  The fact that he caught look, boogyman is a real type of shit.  Tenth planet jujitsu, blackbelt, international competitor.  It's all he does tapped out Sakuraba that's all he does. Yeah that's his profession.  He's a Mason man affords MMR fighter former wrestler. He's but he's Stralsund Instagram pictures naked with his girl.  It's like All right let me go roll this dude up.  What a stud. He's really strong. The nicest guy in the world I bet he is the way he tapped him with that head and arm choke too. He was in half guard.  He could tap quick to spend a lot of pressure, you know, boogie man singing the type of bullshit.  He's he's a guerrilla man. He's so strong the way through him around to I was like I was so impressed at how he got out of that arm bar. We explodes out of stuff like really explosive stuff, really strong guy stuff. But the clamp down on that head and arm choke and apparently, according to Chale shows one who was doing the commentary on the pay per view. He said that's Austin's favorite target, to go to this submission underground.  Yeah, the shit was super underground, super. Nobody even knew it was happening. We had no idea. Yeah, seven people watched.  Do you see Vinny Magallanes refusing the tap on Craig Jones snapped his arm, snapped his ankle.  Oh, no doubt it broke his tibia, Cheesus tibia, his fibula. One of his one of his shin bounces shed, broke, snapped too much pride.  But you could see the angle, got him in the heel hook and you could see the angle. That is his leg is in all the pressures on it. And you see it go kind of sideways and you like that can't be good. And apparently they were talking. Well, they were talking. I watched the match. And Charles, like, what are they saying to each other? But Vinny was saying, you broke my leg while they're still going, holy fuck.  Yeah, yeah. He got it more than once to to grab stuff. He grabbed that same leg more than once. So he's grinding on it with he's got this broken shinbone and he's digging on it with another heel hook.  I wonder how many people watch that for me. And drugs. Three degenerates. I mean, it's on Yevsey five past there it is like so he gets it. And Craig Jones, by the way, one of the very best grapplers on the planet Earth. Yes. Slick and Vinnie was like, I don't tap to heel hooks. I don't tap the heels of he said, I don't tap the leg locks.  So. Right there, he stands out. Yeah, he got up weird to, like his left leg is shot right there. Watch again on Instagram. So he snapped that shit. So he's got it. It's a terrible angle to look at.  Oh, right there. So it's broken. So he broke the bottom of his shin. And that's really dangerous, too, because when you get a break like that, you get infections, it's true, you could lose the leg. It's a really bad result.  Just, oh, he's an animal, but he's an animal. I mean, he's basically always on his right leg. But human legs, how much that dude's grown since the ultimate fighter a long time.  Well, he got to the finals, that PFL million dollar thing, by the way, Rory went over to the PFL now, huh? Uh huh.  Kind of weird, right? Yeah.  It must have been a big offer. Yeah, it was him. Vinnie, make it to the finals. Was it the finals?  Made the finals in Florida. And you got knocked out by Ryan Batur. And then he went over to that PFL thing and he got knocked out by that dude. That's a sports broadcaster. He's a radio broadcaster now that now he's doing the Sean Sean.  He does the commercials for him to God damn it, he fought in the UFC.  Really tough to find that. No, find out. PFLAG knocked about things like White Timecode, he told them in the finals.  Yeah, but then he had success in PFL. Yeah, he just he was he had a research time every time the U.S. there's no time.  Do you need to learn how to really strike? You know, he needed to really understand. If he's impossible, you can't strike.  It's impossible, especially these days. It's fucking impossible, O'Connell, that.  Yeah, there you go. He did find this. He didn't go well for sure either. No shop for him. Shut up for him.  Well, tough guy, really fucking tough guy. Didn't go bad for him in the UFC.  But, you know, he's you know, he's another guy that's sort of developing on the job.  Do the you'll see posted a clip it me whatever. They posted a quick clip from The Ultimate Fighter ten. I said, yeah, dude is like a baby. I have so many good memories from that. I've, I never I've never watched it.  I've never seen it since. God, what a time.  What a fucking huge time for Justin ran with short hair. Yeah. Weird. Justin ran in Roy in there. Yeah. It was not. Oh. Such a good time. I hope they still do the ultimate firemen, they are going to do it again. Yeah, they've signed up with stop though. No, no, just. No, he's so funny. And yes, I think it was Twitter.  He said the interview I saw, he said McCain and Dana said that the ultimate fighter is going to be at the apex center as long along with the fourth fight and two weeks on the twenty third, which nothing's been announced yet.  Are we doing a fight campaign next week? Oh yeah, we should fuck. What night is it? Saturday night. Thursday and Saturday. Thursday interplays Ambros. Wow. And what is. Let's see the car overtake Sarah and your boy Smart who.  I like that. I love that fight. And that's interesting. Chale said that does the guy has a hard time finding submission matches for his Anthony Smith. Mike, that's weird. No. Yeah, that's what he said. Yeah. Apparently Anthony was very, very good on the ground to overtake Jerry's fucking good on the grass.  Go back to that, please. I got the card.  I've had to grapple. Yeah, but just go back to what you got there. OK, so Walt Harris and Alster Overeem, that's sad to share. And then OK. Hey, what did you say.  Smith Texeira Wednesday though the thirteenth I thought was Thursday, 30 to 60. I don't know. I mean, which one you want to do, Joe.  I don't know man. Let's look at the card. So look at Smith Tachira. They're all in Jack and Rothwell and even same old same Pru's going up to heavyweight, huh?  He's asking me self interest. That Drew Dober Alexander Hernandez.  I like that fight a lot. Do Drew Dobre is a guy. There's a dog. He's a fucking dog kid under look guy. He's a Denver kid. I was super impressed with him in his last fight.  Alex Fernandez. No joke, man. That's a tough one to Ray Borg and Ricky Samon shot to reboard. Reboard to went up to 35. Huh. Because Ricky Simmons at thirty five. Right. Anyway, that's Ricky Savol is going down his Ricky now that is about him.  That's right.  Oh Karl Roberson's another bad motherfucker. Oh. Against Marvin Vettori.  That's a good fast Italian kid, right.  Yes. And Roberson super talented man Orlovsky.  How do you put him on the prelim. Who's Philippe Linn's. Who's that guy.  They can give him a photo of some fucking monster from Norway or somebody who is Michael Johnson.  Fine. Do you know that guy. I don't. Sarah Eubanks reports Eubanks, yet the title of everyone's shit on her. They took her off of it. Yeah, Brian Keller, yeah, they give her a title shot and everybody in between. All right. Do you see that I my job at that time, I get off. Take it off. Interesting.  So that's that's a decent card. Is that the Wednesday card? Yeah. We can learn about we can learn about Kuhnen.  Yeah. Right. Yeah. Would I can't let Eddie get drunk though.  And some of it yet. So this is a better card.  This is the Saturday night card. OK, got so Vera Marlyn Vera versus Songa Dong. That's a good fight. Scroll up the Eric your boy Anderson versus Cristoff Jorgito. That's a very good fight to Barbosa versus Dan EGA. A love that I want to see.  I don't want to see what Barbosa looks like at 45 and I do love that QLogic Idalia. I love that Angela Hill fight.  That's a great fight over him and Walt Harris. That should be fun. The better card. All right. That's what we're going to fund and we'll see what else they got there. And this is the rest, Goldthorpe Anthony Hernandez versus Kevin Hall. And that's a very good fight. The court cases, the long face. Yes, yes, OK, Tyulkin, it is Saturday night, beautiful, OK, fight companion, get the cigars, bring in the fucking kuhnen robes when they were called, you know, should we get Freddy?  You all them have any drinks?  I'm not I'm not opposed to him having a drink. There's something that happens really clicks over and he gets so eyes. It's like three drinks in he's gone.  It's insane. He takes over the show. It's hilarious. He doesn't listen now. He just just power through it.  Yeah, well, that's just drunk. Eddie is too. Eddie's maybe just one. Maybe just you know, maybe we shouldn't wine.  I think wine is a good one with them.  Now that whiskey brings out the fucking devil in them, brings out the Indian idiocies line. Well, yeah, I don't think JOIDES would leave the house. We should get him. He's been here twice. He will leave the house.  Oh yeah. He doesn't give a fuck. He's not scared of coronavirus.  Oh fuck. Yeah, he's not scared of it. I'd love to see him. Yeah, he he's upset by all this, too, though. He's ready to move Josele with us.  Yeah, I think Theo's in. We're still going wherever we go. He's in Bryans in who else.  Cowens ready to go. Kalanchoe For sure.  Kallum want to leave Venice the homeless invasion. We all love zombies on the street.  If we all leave he has no one to go with us. Really especially I go find the kids come over here where. What do you think about Eutaw. I'd like you to come here in the summers. It's bad move. Move in the winter say oh bad move. I know. Not bad move at all. You don't know good trails up there.  Yeah. I bet the laws are better. But they're a little looser with things. It was pretty cool over there. Well, it's also a stigma. They've already had one cult go there. I think I think Furt I think Bertel role with this Birte Vertigo maybe.  I think Burt likes California. Bird likes to stay Hollywood, but he likes to lie about it. I agree he's pretty Hollywood.  But if we lock down again. You mean not so Hollywood.  Well I'm on some fucking text messages where they are shitting on Jerry Seinfeld special.  Oh really? Well the first clip they posted was no bueno.  Some text message chains that I was involved in with comics like Wolf, I saw one said, you're special, Ben and Jerry Seinfeld on what the thing must be terrible.  He looks uncomfortable. Well, it looks like he's uncomfortable. It doesn't it's not bad in the sense that.  But he's been doing old material for so long. Like part of his whole thing was he would do specials, but he would do specials with old material.  He doesn't believe in switching an hour all the time.  This is a new hour, though. There's a whole new hour.  Yeah, but he's probably run it for 19 years because his old specials were of his old material. He's special of my old material that I've done before. I was like, hey, dude, I loved you. He's the biggest push guy. Oh, yeah. The biggest portion of.  Oh yeah. He owns like hundreds of Porsche. He's the Porsche. If you go to Malibu, the market there, him and his boy Spiker out there all the time.  Oh really. All the time. And they do a podcast of just Porsches out there.  Do they really. Yeah. Just Porsche podcast Porsches. Hmm. Sounds like a bad idea. Comics love when other comics have questionable specials.  They really do.  I don't think I've ever heard a comic go, dude, have you seen this special besides like Chappelle, every comic wants go dude. Oh that's terrible. I'm like, oh come on.  They there's there's a lot of comics that enjoy when someone, especially someone that's not in their circle, has a special.  You know, it's unfortunate.  I know I I had this talk with Billy. I think one of the reasons his special was like the number three most watched thing in America.  It's huge kitaura at night on a different level. And I think one of the reasons he gets hate is his demos similar to mine.  It's eighteen to thirty six males. And that's where you need a lot of hate. Man. Those those are the guys on the on the Internet. So for him I was like, dude, I know you're special to me. Great, whatever happens. But just know your demos young dude. So the haters going to come out man brace yourself. But that thing was a huge success. Did the haters come out for him?  I haven't looked, I'm sure, but I don't think he gives a flying fuck in his mansion in Bel Air.  You know, I think everybody cares. You you told me this from the get go. You can't you cannot read that stuff. Yeah, you can't.  It's damn near impossible. But you have to. I don't run my account when I saw it.  I don't wanna deal with any of us. Keep moving. Keep moving. Yeah.  You know, when things are going the wrong things are not good. Just when things are bad, use that as fuel to make the next things better and keep moving, you know.  And here do. Yeah. You know, and here key you know, I don't need people tell me. I know. And they go on the road and then get better and get better and get better and that's what you do.  I want to see what people do when this is over, what it's going to be like watching someone's first set in three months to me, like running amok.  Everybody's been clunky as fuck. Well, there's it's the thing is, every time telling it's not going to be like, yeah, Tim's like he's he's basically doing stand up with his rants.  Yes. He's so funny. I loved him.  I loved him too. I think that it's going to be interesting because everyone is going to be stale. It's not or flat.  It's not going to be like most like if you go to the store and you're on the line up and you haven't done standup in three months, everybody else is doing it every night. It's just going to show. Yeah, it'll show. But for the audience, there'll be a contrast this way. There's not going to really be a contrast. It's going to be everyone seems slow and clunky. I mean, people are going to be gung ho to see the first day back.  OK, can you imagine walking down the hallway? We're only hugging each other.  Oh, I can't wait. I can't wait. I can't wait for the first day back. I'm going to. Yeah, I mean, when the first day opens, when the comic store opens, if I'm home that day I'm on stage one hundred percent.  And also I want to give all the money, the waiters and the waitress, 100 percent, hundred percent of money to the waitstaff.  I was getting my money anyways. Yeah but I mean you mean the whole door. I think I'll give it to them. I'll sell out shows and give it to them. Those fucking people didn't do anything wrong. They always work real hard.  Although the fucked over the bastard they got fucked over by this thing because they're, they're the people that are really paycheck to paycheck and then this thing just dries up.  It's a it's brutal. I just I just I think every comic I think people at the Comedy Store and comics on the road and everything, it's just to make us appreciate it so much more. And you have so much more respect for. Take it for granted. I think there's light at the end of the tunnel for everybody, man. I hope so, but this fucking governor is open this shit up, let people take their own chances. Let people decide they know what it is.  Now, dude, when they gave me a ticket on my fucking bike in the middle of nowhere, I was listening to Rage Against the Machine. I wanted to fucking start a protest at Governor Newsom's house.  I was this close to fucking organized and won my first six Politicker.  They're going crazy now and like Huntington Beach and Newport and Eisenbeis and I love it, there's a hilarious video on the video.  The guy goes, Bill Gates is the devil. He's saying all this thing, these things that seem like they kind of make sense.  And then he goes, Bill Gates is the devil that OK belongs lost everybody.  Bill Gates, the devil. What kind of is he, though? But I don't know if he's a devil, but he's a little too much of an interest in these things.  Yeah. Financial interest. How much we need, dude. Much money.  Get the fuck out, man. Yeah, because you and I had had obviously a friendly bet and you were like, I hope you're right, because when governors went, beaches are closed and then we have this tax change with you mean Cound Eddie and I go, dude, I'm telling you, people are going to put up with it. I said, I guarantee 10000 plus show up, you know. All right, let's bet. Let's bet. Friendly bet.  I think you won.  I won. Yeah. It's over right. Oh yeah. Yeah. OK, bucks. Yeah.  But I think that I'm coming you know I think that we need more of those protests for things to really change, you know, for him because it's all right.  They keep saying, like apparently they're suing the governor of Michigan and Illinois, Illinois as well.  Michigan, that lady, she's trying to extend everything.  And then did you see Intec? I think it was Texas. They go, we're going to start finding people for this, this, this, or maybe it was maybe California.  But the sheriff who you know, we're not going to do that. Yeah. You guys got to do your thing. We're not going to give people fines.  And the governor's like, all right, fuck it shows you really if people really don't give a fuck, the government can't do shit.  It's real close to people turning on him because so many people are losing their jobs, so many people are losing their businesses and they want to look there's methods to stay safe. They know that you can be tested. They know that you can everybody can get tested and you can have a certificate that shows you've been tested and then you can go to a restaurant.  I mask and not wear masks. I'll walk around with a fucking T-shirt that says I'm good.  Now let me do that, dude. Yeah, I'm good. T shirt.  I'm good. Back off. Back off. That guy. Security guard at the coffee place. Back up, bro.  Put the mask on. Oh, dude. And then he went to the manager. It was like this point me. I'm like, dude, you're like, I'm nice, you know, I don't know if it just didn't happen here.  I'm trying remember the steak I just saw last night, but people that were like they encouraged snitching or whatever. Yeah, there was a database that got leaked and people who snitched their names got put out.  And now they're afraid that people are going to find out that this is going to have good.  That's what you get to do. That's what you get. It just get stitches. That's what you get, bitch. People don't like that.  You know how insane that is. A fucking cover came out and said, snitch on these people. It's on our governor.  It's the mayor, Eric Garcetti. That's right. Mayor of L.A. But the thing is, it's not what we thought it was. If it was killing people left and right, like something horrible plague. And, you know, we really do have to stay in home and lock down because there's a demon out there, an invisible demon. That's what we thought it was. It's not that it's not good, but it's not that speaking snitches get stitches.  The snitches get stitches. Stitches don't get stitches that Kim Jong un fake his death. Did we find out if they did?  He's healthy. He's driving. A matter of fact, he lost like six minutes to find out if people would tell and try to take power. I think because I was reading.  Speaking of which, he's done it before. Do you remember stiches, the rapper? They had the big stupid tattoo on his face. They're still selling cocaine and shit. Really? Yeah. Yeah. He's I mean, not as popular as he probably was not three years ago. You know, it shows right now, but he's still in the drug gang. I could look him up right now. I'm sure it was more than three years ago. Right.  Takashi's out to right now and Takashi's out talking shit.  He's going live tomorrow or today on Instagram talking about his new music, his record, a video in his backyard.  You know, he turned down government sort of like security because he's going to say he would pay for it. You know how expensive that is.  He doesn't have anywhere to go right now, so. It's not that expensive. What do you think happens to him and he's going to die, every blood in the world wants to kill him.  How many people do you ran out? So many. Now, did they let him out because they let him out? They let him out because of covid.  But, yeah, he he was let out early because he sensed that he was going to have like maybe eight more months. So they just let him out and finish the rest of his time at home, do the letting out so many people from jail that should be in jail for the rest of their lives.  Yeah. Like child molesters. Yeah. It's like I don't I'm I'm baffled. And for what, for this covid are not your goddamn mind. Everybody is out of their goddamn. You're right. Like I'm saying, so disappointing. I think people prepared and were anticipating something that was way more horrible and they can't go back.  They didn't make it and just can't go back because they don't wanna look stupid like Governor Newsome. Like a fuck.  Now, look like he I think Governor Newsom wants to be president. I think that's the same thing with that woman who's the governor of Michigan.  If is the same thing who's getting sued by the house. She's getting sued by people in her own state because they're like, hey, you don't have the authority to do this. And she's saying, I'm going with science and statistics.  You're not, though, but not that she's not my boy, Elon.  And what he says goes down.  But the thing is, she's on a short list of people that for the vice presidency with Biden, that's what it is.  You're going to win because he's not going to win. I'm not going to win. He ketamine's like get this rape allegation out and then you also can't speak. Yeah, I speak out and hear what he's talking about. I have problems with the speech impediment. I talk for a living and I speak better than you. He's so doomed himself.  He's going to die in four years as president.  He's just doomed, period.  Like everything about him is doomed. He can't talk.  And it's like the allegations and the fact that people are showing such fucking unbridled hypocrisy by supporting him, why they were against all these other guys that were accused of sexual assault because they want Trump out there.  They'll ignore everything, just get Trump out. They want their team to win. And that's what they're showing. They're showing it's not teams. It's not believable. Women, it's believe all women. If they're accusing a man that you don't like, it's insane.  I can't believe Trump and I are the best we got. It's not the best because the smart people don't run for president.  Yeah, that's what it is. A lot of the smart ones don't. There's some smart ones out there. Yeah.  But they don't seem to want that job. I think Mark Cuban could do a good job.  I think he'd like to be president. I agree. I'd probably vote. He's more of a libertarian. You know, he's been a real mark. You know, I love it. He's been a real bitch about this covid stuff. Is it? I don't think the NBA should be back. He said recently. Yeah, I think his mom's like 900 years old, so she's worried she's going to get it.  Well, it's like Hollywood aliens. I do put in a bubble, dude. It's like the same.  It's like that Hollywood actor that that Indian guy who's in the Marvel movie who just preaching from the mountains. Who's that like? We're going to open up this and get worse.  We should shut down Kumail Nanjiani, that guy. Shut the fuck up, then make another Marvel movie. He's just saying because his wife has an underlying condition, so he's worried about that, which I get. Dude, from a personal standpoint, I get that. But also read the stats. You're smart. He's super smart. You're smart, dude. Man, there's a little bit of that.  But there's also a little bit of virtue signalling where people are saying things that they know that the enlightened, thoughtful people are supposed to say, and then they get support online.  They check the tweets all look at all these people who agree with me. Look, I did. I got them to like me more, help them in fucking Spider-Man.  I thank you for saying this. You're amazing. Oh, God.  Every life matters every life. And that everyone has to say that every life matters. Yeah, well.  Where were you before this covid thing because people were dying all the time? It's interesting to see that this that obesity is the number one factor in people in New York City, because all these people that want to think that it's OK to be obese, it's fine if that's not cutman.  Now, is it not cute? It's like really bad for you. Yeah. Yeah. We've known this for Kovik. Comes goes. Oh, this is too easy.  And if this doesn't scare your fat ass in the show, do you think that people like with all this fat shaming mentality out there that people will that the government or someone the public health will step up and have some sort of a public health campaign saying, look, folks, you've got to lose weight, you've got to stop eating sugar.  It's terrible for your immune system. Get yourself down to a reasonable size.  So we'd love to see that and see what to the people freak out about it and all the people that try to counter it with emotions and bullshit.  It's all right to have to stop trying to define beauty standards. Muffin tops are cool. Yeah, I don't know what you're going to do, man.  I saw a video. I don't know what I saw video. I think maybe Joshua is a video of kids in the 70s and in gym class, just a random gym class, these kids were all in fucking phenomenal shape.  There's like 100 kids, one slim, everyone slim. That's how it should be, man. I know I'm a little thick, but I'm in shape. Dude, my heart's great. My heart rate's insane. But these kids were all in shape when all these kids you go to high school now, every kid gets a letter from his mom.  He can't work out because of, you know, Billy has sore ankles. Billy, Billy gets anxiety when you make him run a mile. What the fuck? I had to run a mile. Yes. Billing's anxious. Billy gets anxious. Billy his dog really doesn't respond well to pressure.  Leave him alone. Leave him alone. God.  God, that's one thing that we saw from this, is that there's so many people that don't know how to deal with any sort of adversity.  I can't be their friend. Have I have people I used to talk to and when this thing came out in them, it was going to bunker down. And I think candy stores be close to 22 and we're not going to be on the road anymore.  Who am I going to say the name? No, I can't. I won't. They rhyme with was the names, right? We're not going to do it afterwards. OK, I went up.  I can't be friends anymore. Oh, wow.  You can't be my foxhole. Dude, this scared you all this shit, bubba. Well, we can't be friends anymore.  I don't I don't think I'm anxious to talk to Michael Yo on Monday. The way he was describing it. Like, I just.  I'm cool. Michael, be cool, man. You got through it, bro.  He's going to scare the fuck out, everybody. He still thought he was going to die, but he got pneumonia. But here's the thing, pneumonia is still real. People still get pneumonia.  People die from it if you get pneumonia and that I got pneumonia when I was 19.  Yeah, if you get near, my son got pneumonia at two and that you're fucked tonight. That's what happened with him.  But you still survive. Don't come on here. And fucking Michael yo, I will fuck you up. Don't come on in and scare everybody. Do we have we.  We get enough man. You ever watch CNN? You would think the world's on fire. What's that guy's name?  Brian Stelter. He's my favorite. He's a chubby guy. Is like the Baldor chubby guy.  He's rarely on the very feminist's more lemon.  Yeah, but I love when he gets when he's all doom and gloom. Oh, God.  It's just Tim Dolan tweeted this last night. This is interesting. I just I saw it from it's on Newsweek.  What is this coronavirus survivors permanently disqualified from joining U.S. military recruitment memo suggests like what would that be for?  Right. Why? Tim said, what does the Pentagon know? That we don't know.  But but that says U.S. recruitment memo suggests that that's permanently disqualified. So this is the standards change all the time, that this is based on what I mean, if they've show that you can completely 100 percent recover from coronavirus, it doesn't make any sense.  That's I doubt that's true.  I think that memo is probably in response to this idea that you that it could be a reoccurring infection. That was something that people thought those of tested.  What happened to those who tested positive for covid-19 and no longer eligible for military like body cover.  What? No way. We don't know if that's true. During the screening process, a reported history of confirmed covid-19 will be an annotated. Considered disqualifying, reported history of confirmed and I'm not buying I'm not buying it, I'm not buying the victims did that could that could shift back and forth and that's probably just being fear mongering.  Some bullshit, some old bullshit.  KOMO came up on the come up right during this. Andrew Cuomo. Yeah, he did. But again, if you look back what he did initially, if he initially where New York had the problem was that the old folks home and what he did, anybody, the old folks home who got covid, he went in the showing symptoms, get back in there. So then they all got it and they all fucking died.  It's like, did you fucked up, man? Yeah. You kind of fucked them.  Well, I think in the beginning, no one knew exactly what the fuck was going on. I mean, in January, the World Health Organization tweeted out and the World Health Organization, one that everybody's telling everybody that you have to listen to them. In January, they tweeted out that there's no evidence, according to China, that it's it's the catch it person to person, which is insane.  But that's in January. I mean, this is just insane. No, listen, I mean, the first one. But the other thing is, how about the estimates two million people are going to die, know in America alone.  Get ready. I know.  But they're saying that, well, if we didn't have this lockdown, maybe that would have happened. And then and then even Cuomo came out, said what?  I've realized they were doing the lockdown. It's spreading inside the families. Yeah. He's like kind of fucked up there. So we don't know what to do.  Not just that. There's also the concept of immunity that your immune system really needs interaction with other people. Get sweet, dude.  Swinnen did nothing. No, just seminar's. They did nothing. Yeah, I don't know.  Are there no seminars? I thought their numbers were a little higher than the neighboring countries that did do social distancing in lockdown.  Bring that shit up, Jamie.  I don't know this, but I know it's murder wasp. We're coming right now. The murder wasps. Jeez, if I have to avoid murder wasp and rattlesnakes, I that stop.  I don't have a chance. We have a chance to relax. Let me know. Not too. When did they become murder.  Hornets like oh murder hornet murder bs. I don't thought about murdering anything else I know but when did they change their name like they used to be.  Asian hornets, murder bees. Now remember hornets, wasps or hornets.  Killer bees that disappeared.  Yeah, that was Africanized. The idea, killer bees. They would swarm you bees. This is this is a different thing. But this thing is similar to this, though. It's a similar size. I think it's bigger.  I think they're bigger. But here's the thing. Are they murder wasps or murder hornets? Murder wasp wasps.  These wasps, like they never called a murder wasp until like two weeks ago, someone had a great and with it great name.  Hunter Hornet murder. Murder haunted. OK, so murder Hornets.  I'm a college student on my picture. I'm saying I got a murder until two weeks ago.  I never heard that term. Did you hear that term? No, but it's terrifying. I know when they go murder hornets hit Washington, I'm like, well, they're coming to call you dude. That Coyote Peterson guy, though, that guy got stung by one like two years ago.  Now it's a real pain. They didn't call it a murder on America. I don't give a fuck what did in other parts of the world.  Now, are they in Seattle? Is that what happened? They snuck in on some. No, no cargo ship? No, no. I thought they're in DC. Oh, good. I hope they only go to politicians.  Are they in the West Coast? Right in the dick.  I thought it was Washington State, dude, that's where everything seems to be hitting.  That's where the Korona hit first. Is that where it is? Where's the murder hornets?  Jamie takes on Spokane.  Yes. They were discovered late last year. Washington State's not even Ghile. Oh.  So staying relevant. They've been killing two of them were discovered.  Some asshole probably had them as a pet. They're not even breeding. We're just looking for something to be scared of. Now the media's got to sell CLECs.  I mean, they got me they got Korona didn't. But these hornets, these murder wasps did that right now. When I saw I'm like, fuck, let's Corindi.  If that becomes an issue, like they start flying into people's houses and staying in one of them, one of the two was found dead and the other one flew off.  So I was like, yeah, but that's really the fucking story. Isn't CBS which made damn it.  Well, now this isn't too bad. God damn it. Everyone sucks.  The media gets you, man. They got me in business.  Their business is to scare you. The only way they make clicks. How do you get clicks. Someone's got to be scared of something or angry.  We get clicks. We're fine. Yeah.  But will hunt them where insects are hunted and eaten. 30 to 50 people die per year. That's a problem. But they're hunting them. So there's a shitload of people die by rattlesnakes.  You ever look up rattlesnake death. I don't know this. They fuck you up man.  Yeah. Rattlesnakes are not good.  I sent you guys a picture every day. I know. Every day you do. You send me a new rattlesnake video every day.  Do that kind of crazy. The very first one I found as an anaconda with rattler on it, dude, if you like. That snake was so fucking big, that was a big one. Oh, I ran over one once, a junk running with my dogs. It was it was across the street or across the trail. I thought it was a stick.  As I'm running over it, I realized, oh, my God, that's a fucking rattler.  And he just let you jump on him? No, I just I cleared him, but I literally ran over his body. And then I realized in the air that it was a rattlesnake. I mean, thick, like my wrist.  You know, what bothers me is I'll see the snake and I'll if there's if I know if I passed by another coming, I'll wait up front, make rattlesnake rattlesnake this lady with a dog, she's out like a rattlesnake and she's letting her dog just walk and like a fucking idiot, put them on a leash. Dude, I would never like I used to get my son on these hikes. I don't take him anymore. Too many rattlesnakes. But when people have their dogs out they just let them go on the site.  That's where the snakes are. So I ride in the middle because the snakes are always on the side. If I come out, I can see them. But these people let their dogs go up and down the side. I'm like, that's so dangerous. You have no idea.  There's so many tanning beds out there, dude. There's so many people that think they just have shit for brains. There's so many good one old lady.  I see her. She does the same time I do. She's in shape. Tan as fuck. Skin like leather. Looks like a purse, right. She's fucking she's gone. I go, ma'am, there's a rattlesnake about ten feet up she goes she takes her old school hat. She was a white. I know a rattlesnake. She does. OK, does it move. It's on the path. Doesn't move. Just goes right. OK, just right along the side of it.  Didn't give up but probably ready to die.  I survived. World War two is like a rattlesnake because in Pearl Harbor. Yeah.  She's got a softball metaphase. She didn't give a fuck why. She's like why am I like this. Like Sacajawea.  Like when people get to a certain age, I wonder if they do look more dangerous shit like hope and hope something goes wrong.  I said this is my damn. He gets mad. I don't think cares about me because if my grandsons grow up without a fuckin father because you got bestriding that gabai.  Hey man, what if my grandsons grow up without a father. You fucking business for riding a bike. It's like dude it's a mountain bike. It's nothing gay about it.  That is fucking hilarious. What a take. Right?  What a hot date by your dad had serious concerns about your grandson.  Not even worried about your son. Give a fuck.  Oh, that's hilarious. All right. It's three o'clock already. Is it fun to do this so fast? Always does. We covered three minutes of the fight. I think we covered it. Yeah, I don't we cover quite a bit, man. It was hours ago that we forgot. I don't know. So we have to be called in. We solved covid. Yes, we solved everything.  We're good. As long as Jacksonville works out.  You're going to be great man. I can't. I can't fucking wait. You'll see.
