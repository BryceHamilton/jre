My guest today is a very fascinating and fun guy. He is the founder of Spartan Race. He's a business man, a motivator, just a free thinker and a really cool guy.  Please welcome Joe DeSanto, the Joe Rogan experience joined by.  Hello, Joe. How are you? We're rolling over on oh, man. All right. Nice to meet you. Thanks for having me. So the kettlebell, you bring this fucking thing everywhere you go, literally.  I do. I, I lived overseas and I started it. You know, I started it.  I had a six hundred and ninety six pound guy come to the farm six years ago and he wanted to you want to help losing weight.  And I helped him over 18 months get down to two hundred and sixty five pounds.  Wow. And one of the methods I used to motivate him was I said, as you lose weight, I'll carry weight. And eventually I was carrying 100 pound sandbag. Fast forward. And we can get into it. I moved overseas with my family and I tried to carry that hundred pound sandbags. I had made that commitment to him and they wouldn't let it through TSA. So when I landed in in Asia, I asked my wife, I said, hey, could you order a 20 Campa?  It's stupid. I'm Karen Sandvik. Can you order a 20 pound kettlebell? I'll just carry a 20 pounder around so I'm not a complete fraud. And she confused pounds with kilograms. And I ended up with a forty four pounder and it just became my shtick, my thing.  So when you say you carry it everywhere you go, everywhere with it. I go everywhere with it.  So I'm pandak that during the pandemic. I haven't, I wouldn't carry it if we were going to a grocery store. But if, if I'm traveling to see you or I'm going anywhere in the world catabolic come with me.  Vegas anyway. Anywhere. Do you take it as a carry on. I of depends on the country. We operate in a lot of countries and every country treated differently. So some U.S. flights, they'll let me carry it on, which is strange. Others, they didn't ask me to check it. You know, they won't let you bring a pool cue on a plane.  Yeah, they say it's like a weapon. Well, so is that not your weapon?  Well, my answer to them is you'd have to be pretty fucking strong. You're pretty fucking knowledgeable. You could smash someone would one of those things now, but they've let me bring it on planes. China doesn't mind at all. India and India, you got to love this. They ask me to put it in someone else's luggage. So in other words, somebody had just dropped off their luggage. I'm checking the cattle, but stick it in that blue suitcase.  Get it when you get to the other end.  You don't even know who the product of the person is. So that's insane. So I get there and I have to explain to this person in India why I'm opening their suitcase to get to get my English.  The person used to this particular case. Now, this is. So what did they say when you put off? They're like confused. They don't know, like. But if you act with authority, like, they just assume maybe I work for the airline or who knows.  Oh, my God. That's hilarious. Yeah. That's so ridiculous. That is just does that standard behavior in India.  Well, how many times you been over there?  I've been to India twice. It's happened twice in India. Same thing. Same thing in somebody else's bag.  Somebody else's bag in the Middle East. They give me a sentence which I for I can't recall, but it basically says it's gonna be up to God if this comes out the other end.  Verrill. They've lost a dozen of them in the United States and the United States wants you're gonna love this.  I get to JFK and there are two stories in the baggage claim.  So I go to the large luggage area because I'm hoping that's where the catabolic is, where it should be.  But I hear some noise on the conveyor belt above me.  Sure enough, the fucking caterwaul comes flying down the steep ramp.  Homeward almost takes out a TSA, you know, customs officer dance all I'm embarrassed say dense, all the stainless steel.  Right. But I walk over embarrassed, pick up the cattle, don't walk out.  I bought a bowling ball bag like that, but I need a roller on it. I bought one of those for Kettlebell, but I was like, what am I doing? I stopped. I stopped. It's just too much of a pain. Yes, because I don't like to check luggage. I carry my shit like a carrot.  Japan, they the woman will wrap it perfectly as if it's like Godiva chocolate wrap it and cardboard tape it, put a little handle and then in high heel shoes, she'll carry it 100 yards like she's sweating and carefully place it in location. So they're very detail oriented.  That's a different cultural culture. Yeah, yeah. They're they have like one of the lowest death rates and lowest up problems with covered like they're one of the countries that handle it the best. And we're trying to figure out why. And I think it's probably they're really good at following rules, very disciplined. And they wear masks all the time when they're sick.  They weren't. So I lived there for a year. And during Colvard, I put together this phone call that happened every morning. I called it the Warrior Call five twenty seven am. And I had all our teams from forty plus countries get on the call. Thirty minutes. Give me an update from Japan. Give me an update from China. Give me an update from France just very quick. And they shut down Japan right away. I mean. They did not fuck about.  And, you know, they're not shaking hands in Japan, right? They've got the bough. Taxi drivers are wearing gloves.  They don't mess around. So, no, no surprise that they killed it right away.  It's so interesting how human beings that, you know, basically not much different other than they're from a different climate, you know, dif different genes. But it's just amazing how differently they live. It's it's amazing how they all have like when I was in Japan, I've only been once, but when I was in Tokyo is like everyone is so polite, like you walking on the street and it's like there's no garbage anywhere. It's very clean. But yes, yet it's very packed.  There's a lot of people and everyone is very friendly leather goods like the way they handle everything. Everything is very polite, very orderly. One thing I found interesting, I couldn't go to the gym unless I went back to my hotel room and put a long sleeve shirt on, you know? Yeah. They wouldn't let me out. I'm like, I'm not yakuza. Yeah.  I'm not a Miramar, right. Yeah.  They wouldn't let me show you cannot have any visible to at least in the gym. But I was working out.  Now it's everywhere. It's everywhere. And you know, there's simple little things they did to affect human behavior. Like we couldn't find garbage cans on the street like you would in New York or somewhere else. So you find yourself in a situation where you can't dispose of the garbage. Right. So now you're sticking in your pocket. So within a month, you're not creating garbage anymore because pain in the ass. Right.  You're figuring out how to use less and get rid of less.  So they've changed behavior. Subways spotless. Yeah.  I didn't watch. I didn't actually get on any of the subways, but everything was spotless, which was weird. And people were thin. Yeah. Right. Yeah. Smoke.  They smoke a little too much. And this was a lot. They drink a lot too, which is weird. That's not really a fad. Yeah. It's a very unusual culture.  And if you follow back to, you know, the warrior culture, the Sammara and I mean their long history of martial arts, it's really kind of amazing that there's just this island had so much innovation and so much so much mastery of of hidden hand combat, of of swordsmanship, of sword making. I mean, it's pretty incredible culture there.  The Germans, we like to say, of Asia, it's a good way of putting it tight. Yeah. So what were you doing over there? Why were there for a year?  So after I helped that that guy lose that weight. How did you do that?  By the way, he lost 400 pounds. Yeah. Those too close to it. So in a year, 18 months. That's amazing. Was amazing. You're not going to be. We may be at odds on this, but I went.  And I'll tell you why we went raw fruits, vegetables only. And here's a guy that was eaten eight eight Egg McMuffin a day for breakfast and two two liter sprites.  Right.  So he gets he balloons to six hundred ninety six pounds.  How long did it take him to get that big to get back to it. Not as big as he was. You know, when he was big, when he. Yeah. When he left he said he was crying.  He said to me, there's a first time as far as I can remember, where I fit in one airplane seat.  Oh. So this was this was over a long period time. But he we did raw fruits and vegetables and then we did it. We started with a ten mile hike every day, ten miles. Every day, every day. And then and then it went to twenty G and went to ten in the morning. 10:00 at night. Raw fruits and vegetables. We got to a point where he was losing two to three pounds a day.  That ten in ten is that is that's a long hike. A lot of time. Like how much time was that taking him.  He gave up work. He worked for Comcast. They were kind enough to say you're on leave. I, I covered the expenses, which was like two stocks, a salary and a glass hole.  And it was not you know, it wasn't much of an expense. And he spent the whole day basically hiking.  So he hiked all day. And what kept him motivated? Just this idea that he was going to lose weight.  The other end, I took his keys, I took his wallet, and he had no plant. Like, what was I going to do? I was gonna get out.  So where was this? And we have a farm in Vermont. So we basically had him on lock and key.  How did you know this guy before this? I got a phone call that somebody had just finished, one of our Spartan events that was extremely overweight and showed me the photo. And I said, get in touch with this guy right away. This is our Jarrard this is our subway star.  I want to say not yet now. Right. Right. Thank you.  Remember? Yes. So. So I got in touch. You dominie any. And he said game on. Wow. That's amazing. Was amazing.  So he completed the race at six hundred pounds. He was tricked.  He was told that it was a five k walk with. So. So normally that five K Spartan would take, let's say 90 minutes for the average person. He took seven hours.  So tricked into it, thought through it probably would've never come back. But then I found out about them, called them and said, hey, you're invited to the farm. I want to help you do it. We documented we. So you didn't know this guy at all before this? Didn't no. That's incredible. So you just looked at it as, OK. This is a project.  Yeah. I tend to I like broken wingers. I like help him folks that, you know, I had.  I grew up in Queens and Howard Beach, and it was, for whatever reason, organized crime, capital of world. And this going to sound crazy, but my neighbor was one of the big bosses. And one day I was pre teens. He said to me, you know, the best thing we could do on this earth. I said, what?  He said, help people gotta to kill people for living.  And because that that was his perspective. Was he he was a protector. Right. He would help people, even though right from the outside we know what they really do. But but it stuck with me. God help people. Mm hmm. So this was one of those people I helped. Isn't it crazy that sometimes even people that are just you would look at them, they're like they're bad people. They have some good advice. Like even morons can occasionally say something like.  Huh? All right, I got that. You know, like every now and then, like, even even a real fool will say something that makes a whole lot of sense.  He changed my life, this guy. He he he said to me, my parents were going through a divorce, some 12 years old, and he he wants to help me.  So he says, come over. You're gonna clean our swimming pool for us. Don't pay thirty five dollars a week. So I come over on Saturday morning. He says, right. The first lesson, sit me down for lessons. First lesson is if you're gonna come at eight a.m., you show up seven 45. Right on time is late. Great lesson for life. Second lesson is if I'm paying you to clean the pool, I want you to straighten up the shed, straighten up all the lawn furniture, clean the windows, do whatever the fuck you have to do, but make it so that when I get home, I can't live without you.  You are irreplaceable.  As far as a service provider and number three, never asked for money.  You'll get paid if you do a good job and just stuck with me for life in it.  And really, really good lessons from a nun like you say, like a most unlikely source of advice.  Well, you know, not all mob people are bad people. That sounds like a crazy thing to say. But, you know, I've known quite a few of my life and some were genuinely good guys. They were just in a fucked up line of work and fucked up line of work.  Well, you know, a lot of them thought of themselves as soldiers. You know, they really did. They thought of themselves as soldiers in an ancient war that, you know, we're not going to understand. You know, we're not talking about people that are, you know, shaking people down for money. I'm talking about, you know, people who were doing work for other organized crime. And they looked at the government as criminals as well.  They're like they're all criminals. Wall Street. You don't think they're fucking criminals?  That was the exact as a young person growing up in that, I was the exact narrative I heard as I was being indoctrinated, you know, that the government was just as bad.  They kill people front from these guys as what they were saying. There was Wall Street does it with a pen. Mm hmm. What the fuck are you looking at? Cops plant evidence. Yeah. Yeah. So. So I'm not defending them.  No, but that would air mom's not around, but that did a great job with Vegas.  Say they did a kid shopping. Harad Vegas. Very nice.  This guy ended up giving me seven hundred customers by the time I graduated college that I'll see you the whole pool cleaning business.  I done a giant business knock on wood that were mostly connected to and and I became friends with all these guys.  Wow. And could just go in anyways. It was pretty unbelievable. It's pretty surreal thinking back. And I wanted to I want like who wouldn't want to be that you're a young kid, you're in this neighborhood. They got money, respect, beautiful cars like I want to be that that's the problem with that.  And, you know, with young kids growing up around gang members or drug dealers or you look at the new like they they have things that I don't have and they live this life.  They get respect from people feared. Yeah. You know, it looks attractive.  And I'm one of the boss's wife said to me one day, because I you know, I was alluding to, like, how do I how do I get my I might make my bones.  And she said, this is if I had red hair, light skin, I really had dark hair, dark skin. And this isn't for you. You stick with cleaning pools.  This is from the wife. Oh, good for her orses. So, yeah, that that kind of set me straight.  So this guy, you find this guy, he's 600 plus pounds. You whittle it down to, would you say to 60 to 65. He's a big fella already. Must be all right. Yeah. You've got to see that.  I probably could find a photo of the pants that he was coming in versus the pants he left with. I mean, you could fit three people in a pair of pants.  How did you organize his diet? So. So I didn't tell you when I was a kid. On one hand was ravioli's all and guns. On the other hand, my mom going into yoga, meditation, health, food, she was like bohemian, crunchy.  So while you were working for the mob. Your mom was a yoga. Yogi had Monks' in the living room and very embarrassing, so. And the reason that happened was because her mom died of cancer. And she walked into a health food store to kind of figure things out.  This is like in the 70s, probably one health food store in New York at the time.  There's no yoga journal is no hole. People don't even know what a health food store is now. A health food store. They love you. And what do you talk? Health food.  There was there was incense burning. That's exactly right. So she walks in. There happens to be an elderly yogi that just landed in JFK from India in the health food store.  She strikes up a conversation with this yogi changes her whole life. Right.  Comes home, throws away sausage peppers, eggplant parts all out of the house. Wow. Parents get divorced for obvious read.  She's going to go in a different direction.  And I am trying my best for the next 10 years to have my friends not come over because I'm embarrassed. Right. There is like in the pictures on the wall, there's Bede's, there's chanting, there's monks.  And I want to be a gangster. And so.  Yeah, so.  So anyway, so she maybe through just repetition would just instill this idea that you got to eat healthy, you know, you got to get over raw foods and we're going to go vegan.  All that, all the things that are somewhat popular now.  And you got to do yoga and you got to sweat everyday cold showers way before Wim Hof like she was into the cold shower. Really? Oh, my God. This was like proper food combining this idea of intermittent fasting. We were fat. My mom my mom fasted for 30 days.  OK, this is back in the 70s while meditating. So.  So what was that like? You were at home while she was doing. Yeah. My grandfather, her her father had to come to the house and rip her out of the room because he thought she was going to die like she'd get.  Then she's sitting, meditating. She was pretty extreme. And. And so I had to balance these two things. Like like. And so, yeah, I guess what I do now is is a little tough guy, a little yoga.  I guess that's what it is. But this guy's diet.  Yeah. So from my mom. Right.  But you're dealing with a man who obviously has an extreme health condition. He's morbidly obese. You know, like how do you know how many calories to give him? What's healthy, what's safe? Like how how do you know how to proceed there?  So if there's doctors listening, they're probably going to say that I'm I'm crazy, but. And then I'll answer the question more succinctly. Mom introduced me to a guy named Dr. Fred Beachy. You could look him up. He's ninety two now.  He decides fifty five years ago that he's only going to eat raw fruits, vegetables. That's it. There's an Italian guy that was a weightlifter. He's only going eat raw fruits and veggies and he's going to he's going to test on himself like a guinea pig.  Does it work or does not work? Is this the best diet or not?  I'm just gonna test it on myself, he says.  And what he finds is that, you know, he feels better all the things that people agree or don't agree with. So I wasn't necessarily knowing that and meeting Dr. Beechy and seeing my mom and I wasn't necessarily into like how many calories.  It was just like if you eat good healthy food, less ultra processed food, you're not going to starve yourself.  What you need, you could eat 40 salads.  I don't really care was my message to the guy. But you're not going to you get tired of salad. Right. Once you tie your salad, then you want the other thing. Then you want to go to have a cookie, but you'd only eat salad.  You're never gonna eat over eats out. So I always eat is fruits and salads, fruits and fruits and veggies. That's just raw.  And everything raw or anywhere are not cooked. Because. Because the theory was, if you cook it, you kill it.  And. I don't know how many months into it we are, but he's probably down to 350 pounds, 400 pounds, and he says to me, I've got to go to the doctor. And I said, What is he talking about?  I got to get my liver, liver levels checked. You're not a doctor. And I'm really worried. You got me on this ridiculous diet.  And I looked at him and I said, You stupid motherfucker.  I said, you were eaten eight Egg McMuffin every day and drink and two two liter sprites. How many times did you get your liver levels checked when you were doing that?  You're worried about eating fruits and vegetables that that's fucking up your liver.  Anyway, I talked him out of it and and he stuck it out. But we would have we would have battles like that where he was in agony.  All pain, serious pain might mean losing that much body when your body's probably freaking the fuck out.  Like, we can't do this. I mean, think is sustainable. This is like a three hundred and this is a 720 degree turn for him. From from what he was.  Did you ever hear about the guy? We brought it up a few times. Was it in the 60s, Jamie? You the guy who'd he fasted for a whole year? He did just vitamin drips and he was enormously obese and he just did vitamin drips and fasted for a whole year. But the crazy thing about it was he didn't get stretched out. His body absorbed the skin.  I mean, maybe it's just his personal genetics. You know, like some women, they get pregnant. They have massive stretchmarks other women. They snap right back like a rubber man. It's there's no rhyme or reason. It seems to be genetic. But this man who was really fat, he lost all this weight, but he lost it everywhere, like his skin came back normal sized.  He didn't have to have any of his skin removed.  I would I would bet if it wasn't genetic and unique to him. I've I've done very long distance races where we had limited food.  And I've read about people that have been stuck at sea, let's say, for 72 days, and their teeth get extremely white and their skin get, you know, if they're not getting sunburned, gets beautiful. I think I think, you know, I'm speculating. I'm not a doctor. Your body eats any excess so that I'm making that up. I don't know if I think that might be it, because, I mean, if you if obviously you're both morons.  But if you think about this guy's skin, that's the thing that always happens. I mean, I've had friends that lost a ton of weight and they would have these big flaps of skin.  He had it and they wanted to get it removed. But this guy didn't. This guy, his whole body shrunk was this sub Dom de Augustino told told us about this or what? This someone I recall.  I heard. But I'm looking for pictures to see. I heard about it and stuff. Yeah, I heard about it.  But that was the fascinating part of the story to me was a whoa, like this guy. Not only did he live off of his fat and I.V. vitamin drips, that's what he took for a whole year. So he lived off of his fat. His body had, you know, hundreds and hundreds of pounds of fat to lose. He lost it all. But that his skin shrank was fascinating to me. I'm like, man, if we could convince people to try that.  Yeah. But I begin. I don't know if that's the healthiest way to do it. I mean, you know, what kind of long term damage you're doing, if any.  So I, I'm a believer again, no scientific. I go back to like ancient times and I say to myself, we never had an abundance of food and I couldn't walk into a grocery store and have access. If we had food, we had food. And so I would think our stomachs and our digestive system needs time. It's not used to just constantly taking food on demand.  I wake up coffee. Don't eat that. I don't think our stomachs are made for that. So I don't know about fasting for a whole year. That's a different right.  But also, you have to get to that crazy state to be able to do that.  You've already abused your body to the point where you're hundreds and hundreds of pounds overweight. That that's not normal. Anyway, that's tough. That doesn't even like you won't go back to hunters and gatherers. It wasn't impossible.  No, no. They wouldn't be able to do that. I mean, and he was probably in a bad and probably not very active, right?  Probably. Yeah. So this guy you just say you're just Guinea as much salad as you want, as much fruit as you want. But that's it. That's it. And just by doing that on these long walks and how long these walks taken, you do a 10 mile hike.  Well, in the beginning, as you can imagine, those were really long hikes.  Yeah. Right. And probably, you know, two miles an hour. So five hours to get that done.  But as he lost weight and he got more fit, he hustled. And on the farm, on our farm in Vermont, it's hilly. So I could either send them, you know, through the fields, which we did in the beginning. But eventually now he's climbing mountains, too. And and then I started adding weight. Now he's got to carry it. Little 10 pound sandbag and a 20 pound sandbag. So we just kept upping the ante as his body adapted to what we were doing to him.  And he just kept boom, kept taking off weight. Wow.  Yeah. And so after 18 months to let him have a cake. No, not yet.  But I'll tell you what. Somebody heard about what I did and this guy shows up. Number two, we'll call him and he's 300 pounds. He wants to get to 200. And I said I'd head up the mountain. You're going to sleep in the cabin because I just went through all that time with the other guy. And we're gonna be much more efficient here. First week, you're only eight Napoles and clean out your system. I gave him a giant bushel of apples.  Put him on top of the mountain 30 days. We had him down to 200 pounds and was 30 days, 100 pounds. And there are 30 days that seemed scary, scary hike in raw fruits and vegetables. And here's a guy that was sedentary, truck driver and not really moving around much eating shit foods. It's not rocket science, right? You eat shit food. You're not active. You're gaining weight. You eat good food. You're very active.  You lose weight.  Right. And his girlfriend picks him up. It's 30 days. They fucking leave the farm, unbeknownst to me. They go straight to Ben and Jerry's and he put on like 18 fucking pounds in a day.  Right.  So, I mean, there's psychological issues that I that's not what I'm fixin. I'm doing the physical part.  Well, I don't think that a person willing to do 18 months, as you said, with a job, he hung in for a while to 18 months. Is this just psychologically you're building up some pretty spectacular endurance? Yeah, just from raw fruits and vegetables for 18 months and hiking 20 hours a day. I mean, you put in some miles on your mind there. I mean, that's that's strengthening that that muscle of discipline in a way that you probably never done in his whole life.  He got tough.  He he finished a big event with us was that was like the big moment for him at the end and gotten out, gotten a single seat, an airplane when he got a girlfriend like stuff started to come together form so dizzy maintained he gained.  He was at 265 at our best. And my latest understanding is at 350 he bounced back.  Oh that's good. Better than six. Ninety six. Yeah. But 100 leads to 200. What did he do differently.  I mean you come off the raw fruits and veggies and you stop walking 20 miles a day, but he slip a cake in here and there. Right.  That's got a sock though. Like you get him down to like this really amazing weight you've got.  I mean, what am I can do? I can't keep all these people nothing I do.  No, but still you get them there and then they gotta they've got to fly. I got to do it. Yeah.  It sucks that you got that far and then you see and put one hundred pound. How long does it take to put a hundred pounds on. I'm sure it was 90, 100 days but they snap back.  I mean it's that pendulum swing. Right. Like oh my God, I get regular food now. I don't have to hike as much anymore. I mean, I'm a believer.  I don't know if you are. I'm a believer. The number one motivator for human beings is the avoidance of discomfort. Right. Because if we didn't avoid discomfort, we'd freeze in the snow. We'd fall off a cliff, we'd get caught. Right. So we're always constantly even subconsciously avoiding discomfort. And to be healthy, you got to be uncomfortable. Yeah. Train. We had e-health. Those are hard things to go to bed early night, drink as much.  And so unless somebody is holding you accountable or unless you're like, obviously you're a high performer, I'm a bit of a maniac in that.  Like, I'm more uncomfortable if I'm not if I'm not optimal if I'm not being my best. Right. But most people that's not that's not the goal.  You have to kind of make your mind into the your mind has to seek discomfort.  It has to seek these difficult tasks. You have to enjoy it. And you have to figure out a way to make your mind enjoy those things. And some people comes easy and some people it doesn't seem to some people take a long time. I always tell people the best thing you could ever do is force yourself to a schedule. Just write it down. Today, I have to do an hour on the treadmill. I have to do an hour no matter what.  Even if you're fucking walking, you're doing an hour on a treadmill the next time you do want to do it, just OK. You did an hour and this is the amount of miles you got in. Next time you're going to, you know, add three miles, put it put an extra three miles in that one hour and just keep doing things like that right down. Today I'ma do 100 push ups and to do 100 sit ups and madou, 100 chin ups.  That's today. And then force yourself forces up to adhere to a schedule, make a Monday, Wednesday, Friday workout schedule. Give yourself some time off. You know, I don't it don't even crush yourself to the point where you can't do it. Make it so that you really appreciate those Tuesdays and Thursdays. But on Monday, Wednesday and Friday, you're gonna fucking get after it. And this is what you're gonna do. Most people just try to go workout and you're kind of aimless and you show up and you pick up the jump rope and you jump a little rope.  Maybe you hit the heavy bag a little bit, maybe you do some curls, but you don't really have an aim, you know, and that's why people like to hire trainers, because the trainer will tell you what to do. Well, you can tell yourself what to do if you don't have money for a trainer. You don't even have to have fucking equipment, you know, with body weight, squats, sit ups, chin ups, push ups, you can kick your fucking ass.  You could give yourself a brutal full body weight workout and you could find these for free on YouTube. There's a ton of them. There's a ton of these bodyweight workouts you could do. Just force yourself write it down. Monday, Wednesday and Friday. I'm going to do a hundred pushups. I'm going to do one hundred chin ups. I'm going to do a hundred sit ups, even if it takes me all fucking day, even if I have to do ten and ten and ten and keep going all day.  Just that's what you do, do ten pushups. Take a break for twenty minutes, do another ten, but get those hundred in here.  Here's a question I have for you. I agree with you 100 percent body weight and discipline. Yeah, but you're a fighter. Tell me if you agree with this. In the 70s, I remember as a young kid seeing Rocky.  Yeah. And that was my introduction to for many kids actually in America, that was our introduction to fighting and would, for whatever reason, at a very young age, it was intriguing to me. That a person, a fighter, would get out of shape and then get in shape. You know, why wouldn't they just stay in shape the whole time?  You know, it's a discipline issue. It's also like a lot of fighters are wild people. You know, one of the things that fuels them is not just this desire to compete. They're wild. Dougherty It fucked up. They like to drink to party delight. Womanize. They like to go out on the town and be the fuckin man, you know. And and they get fat. Like Roberto Duran was famous for that. Right, to get real fat in between fights.  And then you have to lose weight.  And just you know that there's guys that don't like Bernard Hopkins never, never gained weight. And he was super disciplined and always a really clean and was a elite athlete deep into his 40s. He was a world champion deep into his 40s. Which is very unusual for a boxer.  And so my question is, is it makes sense why they go in and out. They don't they don't maintain it in the very disciplined fighters would perform better, I would imagine. Right.  Because then, yeah, for the most part.  Do you think. Because is the way I call it the Spartan paradox. Right. And you probably have a better name for it from all the years of fighting.  But like, if you have a date on the calendar, the Spartans knew they're gonna battle if you know, you got a fight coming up.  You'll do those push ups, those squats. Right. And those crunches. Some guys will.  But if you know you've got a battle, come. Okay, I'll give you an example. Andy Ruiz. Andy Ruiz. He comes in last minute, knocks down Anthony. Joshua becomes the heavyweight champion, the world first Mexican heavyweight champ of the world. He's a fucking hero, gets fat as fuck. Balloons up to 280. This is while training for the next fight weighs in at two eighty loses the rematch. Knew it was coming.  Got rid of his trainer. Had all sorts of fucking problems and camp party too much.  Knew it was coming. Knew the day would come and do the work. Wouldn't do the work. Just just was living. The lifestyle just got too wrapped up in the fact that he was the champion, too wrapped up in partying. And next thing you know, he lost the title. And now, you know, he he's faced with this very difficult task of trying to get a fight for the title now because he's a dangerous fighter still. But people he's not really the draw that he could have been if you beat Joshua the second time.  He's a superstar. You know, he's just he's up there with Tyson Fury. He got cocky. He got well, whatever was man, he got lost in the lifestyle. The lifestyle gets all these guys, you know, you're hanging out with a lot a lot of your buddies that you came up with. You know, maybe you've got a buddy who drives you around, maybe got another buddy who does security and they like to party and there's girls and maybe a little bit of cocaine, a little bit of alcohol.  Next thing you know, you're fat again, you know, and this is it's real common. It's really common.  Would you say at least I see it in our community is for the most part, most people, if they know they got something hard, come in. They'll wake up a little earlier.  It's a good motivator. But some people cram for tests, right? Some people, Pusha, like if you tell someone they have a fight in three months, some people start drinking water right now and they start eating healthy right now and they write down a schedule, they start monitoring their heart rate. Maybe they get a woops trap and start, you know, checking with their heart rate variability is make sure they're recovering from their workouts correctly and do it scientifically.  Other people go three months. All right. We're gonna party for a month and then two months I'm going to get after it and then two months into it. Look, I'll need six weeks. Let's go to fucking Kancoona. Let's go do this. Let's go. And then they say, I'll be fine. I'll fuck this motherfucker up no matter what, and then come fight time. They know they didn't put in enough work and they're nervous. And so they took shit at the way and they try to push the guy.  They try to fuck with his head. You know that you show this insecurity come out. The psychological aspect of fighting is it's a crazy battle. And oftentimes that psychological aspect of it is either reinforced by discipline or the opposite. Look, if you know you don't have any discipline you like, it plays on your psyche and it fucks with you. And it really gives guys tremendous anxiety. And there's a lot of very, very talented fighters that, for whatever reason, are just not very disciplined.  It's it's really common sometimes, sometimes the most physically talented guys. It came a little too easy for them. Maybe they have some unique gifts, maybe they're very fast, or maybe they hit very hard. And those things are really kind of genetic, like especially hitting hard. And you could take a kid who is just starting out and he can hit harder than a guy who has been fighting for ten years. It's weird. It's just the way you're built.  It's just the way you built, you know, and some guys just have it and some guys will never have it. They could be world champions. They could be fighting ten, fifteen years and then retire and never have a real one punch. Knockout power and other guys are born with it. You get a guy first day the Jimmy hits the pads like holy shit and other guys don't. And some of those guys with the power, sometimes they just fuck off.  Sometimes are there. They're not disciplined. Sometimes the guys who don't have the power, they work harder and they they you know, they develop a better, more well rounded skill set to compensate for the fact they don't have that one punch knocked out power.  Would you say I have an opinion, but would you say the athlete doesn't matter if it's boxing, whatever. Right. That has both. That has the genetics. And that just.  That's a Michael Jordan. That's a Roy Jones Junior. Right.  You know, that's a that's a that's a spectacular athlete, but it's also superintelligent. There's up discipline and you need intelligence to like people.  People look at intelligence, unfortunately, like book smart and buy book smart. I don't mean someone who's intelligent, who's uneducated, is not capable of being book smart because most of them are like Mike Tyson is a good example, like Mike Tyson is a very intelligent guy. And when you talk to him about like boxing history and we talk to him about like the history of philosophy, when he starts talking about great warriors and Marcus Aurelius and some of the books that he's read, like he's very intelligent, but he's intelligent, figuring out how to fuck people up.  Like you can't get that good at heavyweight boxing. Just on physical talent, which clearly he had. And just on genetics, what's also clear, he was 190 pounds and he was 13. Well, when he was 13, Terry, I was told me, took him to the smokers and they wouldn't believe it. They're like, how is that holds out, kid? He's all he's 13. He's like, get the fuck out of here. OK, 16.  And so he put him in there with 16 year old and he would knock them out cold because he would just. He had rideable. Yes. And he had focus and drive. But those that that perfect unicorn is a a person who's obsessed, but also extremely intelligent and gifted. That's the unicorn. That's Jon Jones. That's that's Roy Jones Junior. That's Michael Jordan. That's the the these these freaks. You know that when you see them, you look at Turkey.  Yes.  Where they're everything, they have the whole thing. Oh, they have the passion for the sport. They have this insane dedication. And they also have incredible talent.  And so. So those are the goats. Yeah. Those are the goats. So I, I, I graduate high school and I want to go back to the neighborhood. I don't want to go to college. Right. Because for obvious reasons, I want to be around these guys and I got this business that's that's doing great. And a friend of mine says because my mom moved to Ethicon, New York, to get me away from the neighborhood when they got divorced.  So a friend of mine, Ithica, says, why don't we go to Cornell Cornell's Ethicon? And I said, How the fuck would we go to Cornell? My grades suck. I'm not planning on going to college. I got this business. I said, my dad's a professor. I'll get us in. So coming from the neighborhood I came from, that made sense. We got a guy that's gonna get us into college, so we both apply.  Would we do great? And the application would do great in the interview. Neither of us get in. But now I'm interested. Right. When you when somebody pushes back and says, no, you're not allowed to come here now, you know, you want in. I wasn't even my intention to go to college. Now I want to go.  So because they said no. Right. So I say to him, and this ties to what you were just saying.  I say to him, well, fuck, if we're gonna do it, why don't I spend the summer going to St. John's in Queens while I'm doing my pool business and learn how to study? Cause I haven't I've never studied buckled down. Get serious. Get discipline. He says, screw that.  We're gonna go to Vegas when we go to Vegas. Give up your business. Go to Vegas. We'll party all summer and then we'll buckle down in September when we get here. Why would we would we waste the summer is our last summer. So we diverge and I study and I run my business and he goes to Vegas and we both come back and we reapply. We do.  Well, that semester we're allowed to go.  It's called extramural, loud to take three classes, non matriculated in the school, and then and then apply. We both do it and they don't they don't accept us.  So he diverts he goes to Vegas.  He goes to you and Alvey and I stay and I say, fuck this. I'm I'm doing it again. And I do it a second time. I do it a third time. Finally fourth time they accept me and I pound my chest and I tell people this story right. Look, look how great I am.  I was disciplined, unlike him who went to he became a giant medical marijuana fucking land, barbwire. So maybe maybe discipline on that guy or. No, but well, you know, sometimes people find a path that suits their personality, like off.  Oftentimes people confuse discipline with focus. And this is why that's important. There are things that. Some people can excel at because they're focused on them and because they're drawn to it and they have an incredible passion for it, versus like you tell a guy like, hey, you know, you're going to study to be an electrical engineer. And so, like, I don't want to be a fuckin larochelle engineer. Well, you have discipline. And so they don't have the drive and they don't they don't get excited about it and they don't.  But if you tell that guy whatever, you're going to be a golfer and he fucking loves golf and he's practicing every day and he becomes a professional golfer, you say, well, I thought that guy didn't have any discipline. Well, it's not that he didn't have any discipline. He's just not interested in that other thing. I was never a disciplined kid, but I was about find things that I loved and I was obsessed and I was felt embarrassed by it because people would say, oh, your son, look to my mom.  Your son is so disciplined. And she's like, my son's fucking crazy. Like, he's not disciplined. He finds these things and that's all he does all day long. It's not really discipline because he doesn't clean his room. He's he's fuckin lazy. It's all sorts of shitty. Suppose doing. I never did my homework. There's all that. But if I had a thing that I was into, I was obsessed, crazy about it. But I would it would bother me that I didn't really have discipline.  Like if I had jobs that I had to do, I didn't do a good job at them, like construction jobs that I had.  But when it kind of to find those things, though, how did you find those things? Do you stumble upon Ocky?  Just good luck. Martial arts. I just got lucky and it clicked with me like almost immediately I became obsessed, you know, and I wanted to be. I wanted to excel at it. And so I was just doing it all day long. And it was kind of stunning for my family. They didn't even know I had that in me. Like, they thought that I was just gonna be this ne'er do well, you know, because I just really couldn't concentrate on these jobs that I would have.  I just I was bored. But when I wasn't bored, I was very excited by things. I think for whatever reason, whether it's my genetics or my upbringing, I just had a very weird personality that didn't fit in with normal work. I was allergic to the idea of having a nine to five. I've never been in an office like I've never worked in a place where I was about ran a bunch of people. Never, never had one.  I just deliver newspapers. I worked on construction sites. I drove limos. And then I became a comic and I taught taekwondo along the way.  But that said, I luckily dodged that bullet. But that was the fear. Like there was something in me that was like, I can't fucking do that. I would go to visit my mom at work or I'd see people that were working in an office. I'm like, I can't fucking do this just repulsive.  It was like I was in a sewer. I would be in there like, I've got to get out of here. These people, there's no fucking light in here. They're all wearing ties. They're all wearing slippery soled shoes. And you've got to listen to this. Jack off. Was in the corner office, like, what the fuck kind of life is? Is it just felt constricting, like there was no oxygen, like I had to get out of the room.  I have a.D.A. I'm sure you have. I don't I don't have I don't know if it's real. I don't know what that means.  Well, I read a great book and now it's called The Eddison Gene, and I've never been clinically diagnosed, but I definitely have it. And you'd know if you like, we probably got probably half of it.  Yeah. And so he argues the author argues in the Eddison gene that really it's not a thing.  What it is, is a hunter gatherer gene. That's a remnant gene. He says we were all hunter gatherers. And as a hunter gatherer, we have to scan the environment. We're looking for an out. We're looking for threats. We're looking for things to eat. Right.  And so you're all over the place. But then when that deer comes out, you're on just like you found martial arts and you were on. Right. But otherwise, you're kind of scanning the environment and you're not really interested and then you're interested. And then we became an agrarian society and now we're planting seeds and we're sitting there drinking coffee and we got the suits on. Right.  And we're little more proper, but some people still have that Hunter-Gatherer gene and you're like, fucking sit around and wait for shit to grow. I want to make shit happen. I want to I want to go after stuff. So that's his that's his argument. And I suspect that's what you're talking about.  Well, see, here's where I diverge there, because I think gathering and farming and stuff is kind of exciting, like growing things and watching food come out of the ground and processing that food or, you know, harvesting that food and it and then eating it.  Like eating a salad that you grew yourself is something very 1000 percent agree with that. Very rewarding. But sitting still. Right. That's not rewarding. What's not rewarding to me is being compliant to a bunch other people with some you got some weird, rigid rules and you're under fluorescent lighting and you're in some strange environment. That's not natural. What I think is the people that adapt to that world, that nine to five world or more compliant, they're more they're more journalling Japanese.  But I don't even yeah, maybe in some way. But I don't know those I don't know whether it's cultural, but it's there's something about the human beings that are willing to do that office work to the willing to go in and, you know, abide by the rules of human resources. That debt just does no that. I have no none of that in me. So that to me is just that's like death.  Here's the question, though. People that are listening to this, I found I don't know if you agree with this. There is. There were a ton of kids along the way of growing up as I was building my business. That was how I'm not into this. I'm not into that kind of like you described yourself.  And they don't do anything because they're looking for that thing. And I would argue do something, do fucking something until you find that thing.  Yeah. I've never been that kid, though. I know I've always been into things. I was it was an art or was into something. I was always I was found things that I was interested in. Just none of them seemed like they were normal things that other people wanted to do for a living. Like the path, like a career path. But I think that there's a lot of people that don't have any. There's no one there. They're not modeling their life after someone that they see that they admire, someone that's successful, someone that is doing something that they enjoy and love.  Sometimes kids have to see that. And if their parents are live in a bullshit life and their neighbors live in a bullshit life and most their family lives a bullshit life, they just fucking lay around, you know, and then they seek refuge in drugs or videogames or something that stimulates them. And video games are a real problem. Their real problem. You know why? Because they're fuckin fun and they don't. Yeah, well, I'm I have a real problem with them.  And you you you do them and they're real exciting, but you don't get anywhere. Right. It's like you could do like like martial arts. Right. You could learn jujitsu. You get obsessed by jujitsu.  And then three years later, you're you're like an elite jujitsu athlete. You're like you're entering in competitions. You're a purple belt, you're moving up. Yeah. You're doing well. You're thinking like I might be able to open my own school.  One got confidence. If I have 100 students and those hundred students or pay me X amount of dollars per month, I can make a living. Holy shit. I can have. This would be amazing. And then you see your jiujitsu school and your jujitsu instructor has all these students and drives a Mercedes and he's got a nice family. And like, that's the future. This way you're doing something exciting and fun and you don't. Or you could just be playing fucking video games three years later.  You could be that same kid just playing video games, waiting for the next dicks, whatever the fuck game is, you know, next x box game to come out and you're gonna waste your time.  You have children. I have children. And it's a big battle in the house. And my kids, I don't know if you're going through this, but my kids are now saying, well, dad, this guy made all this money with his video game that he's unable to appeal to so soon.  Like, that's one in a billion kid.  I don't know if it's one in a billion. But, you know, look, I heard the same argument about comedy. You know, my my own parents were like, you know, a few people make it as a comedian. I was like, OK, does anybody make it? Somebody makes it right. They figure out how to do it. They make a living. I'm going to do that to stop. Look, I know what I'm doing.  I was real lucky that my parents were not around very much. So I didn't get much advice. So I figured it out myself. So there was no one telling me I couldn't do it. So Greenfields. I yeah. Just I was like, I'm going to find my way through this. And since no one's telling me it's impossible, no one's telling me I can't. Occasionally I'll hear someone say, what are the odds? Listen, this fucking loser.  That's my thought. Was always like, that guy's a loser. Like, if you think like that, you're a loser.  But there are kids that make a lot of fucking money playing video games.  But the thing is, like, you have to be adaptable. You have to be able to play multiple videogames because the one videogame that you get really good at. What are the odds that's going to be around five years from now? You know, like what's the big one now, like fortnight? Do they make money off of that? Yeah. Yeah. And then there's a call of duty. They make money off that. What's the big money star craft used to be the big one, right.  That legal legends counterstrike. Counterstrike is it's still the Halflife mod.  Yeah. Variations of it have come out still basically the same exact game. They don't make money off quick, though, right?  Not really. Now really. No one wanted to. Guys do. Yeah.  See it's it's you got to pick the right game, you know, you be extensively running it and spend five, ten hours a day and you have to.  You would have to. Yeah I'd, I'd, I'd vomit.  It's like let's go down this road. Can I read you. Sure. A text. You're gonna die with this one. Okay. I. A month ago that a month ago I said, listen, school's out. All the kids are playing video games. I'm going to hold a camp on the farm. Kind of like what I did with a guy that was having an invite. Friends and families, kids, because nobody's gonna send me kids that don't know me.  It's gonna be a fucking bad ass camp, 14 days a hell. No video games, no phones. And we are just gonna crush these kids in tournament. A little soldiers.  I get how all these kids you talk.  I had my door, my seven year old daughter, all the way up to an 18 year old. So I had I have four children. So seven to eight to 18, most of them 11 and 13 noses. Their idea or their parents idea. So I get I get the idea and I reach out to a bunch of friends and family. I said, I want to hold this camp, call it from the end of June through mid-July.  Who's in. Who wants to send me their kids?  And you've got to keep the kids there. And I'm going to keep kids on the car.  I'm going to finish. It's on me, but I'm going to turn them until, you know, it'll be fun. I'm embellishing a little bit when I use some of these words like fun.  And really, what I want to do is, is tournament to warriors and get them off the friggin phones. And selfishly, for me, selfishly, I want my kids to be like, it's hard for me to do this to my kids alone. But if there's another 16 kids around, 18 kids around, everybody gets sucked up in the vortex. Right. Right. So, anyway, first day star unburnable. Unbeknownst to me, we left their phones in their rooms.  And unbeknownst to me every night when they got done with their work, they would then get on the phones. Of course they would. I just wasn't thinking about it and start texting the parents. Give me the fuck out of here. This guy's fucking nuts, right?  But I don't know that's happening. My wife's not there. I got our four children. I got 18 other kids. And the texts that are going back to the parents, those first three days, I'm going to read you one there.  But they're going nonstop. And they eventually get to my wife. She then immediately races to Vermont, like, what are you doing? This is not even your business. Why are you doing this? People are going to hate us. What if we can't have. We can't do this.  We're so I'm fighting with her. I'm fighting with the kid's parents. Because now I'm now in five days in and I'm saying, listen, our four kids are going to finish the descent. Kids are gonna finish this.  Well, what is. You've set up a schedule. So this guy I got an Olympic wrestler living with us, a guy named Andy Roll that who just happens to live with us, which is a story I've got mountain warfare school veteran who's living who's there in Vermont. And I've got this woman we call the seed Huntress. So she's more like my mom, Bohemian, this and that. And those three people are going to provide expertise along with my insanity.  All right. We're going up and down the mountain. We're carrying rocks. We're going in ice cold water. We're going to run it like buds.  Basically, the kids, the girls and boys. Right. So at the end of it, I get texts from the parents that say, do you know, let me send you some of the text I was receiving while while you were there, Joe.  So this is this is the parent. How's it going to his 15 year old son? Kid responds Awful parent says Joe said, you're doing great. Kid says this might be the worst experience of my entire life. It's literally like we're in the military. Parents not taking the bait. Parent says there's got to be something good about it. Kid says literally nothing, parent says. Is it harder than a seven minute pilottown ride?  He just won't take the fuckin bait. Get says, Dad, you try carry on.  Thirty five pound rocks up and down the mountain all day that says, come on. No funny stories get says when they get mad at us, they stick us in a freezing cold. Riverrun So somebody cries. No, and the counselors are terrible.  Dad says, What else did you do today, kids? That sounds like a dad who knows his son needs this. Yeah. You know, and this is this is the right kind of dad.  I, I didn't have experience ever before dealing with parents that wouldn't let their kids struggle a little bit.  All right. And so I happened to have a dad. This dad didn't come after me. The other parents were all coming after me like, oh, we don't want psychological damage. You should release the kids. Your wife's got to come there and stop this.  Dad, I spent forty five minutes keeping my legs off the ground, six inches today.  Dad says it'll be great if your six pack kid kids says, Dad, this place sucks. You never have enough water. You never have enough food. I almost passed out today. Are you and Mom hearing me? Dad says, don't be a pussy. Really? Wow. Kid says like the dad. Yeah.  Kid says if your mom spent one day in these conditions, you would both be dead. Dad says you need to embrace it. Oh, boy.  Hang on. I want to read you. Maybe the dachas said, fuck you, I'll do it with you.  Well, it gets better because at the end, I did have the dad. I'd had the parents come. Dad finally says, Do you want us to call Joe called Joe. He'll lighten up on you. Kid says you clearly never met this guy. He is a psychopath. OK, this is an illegal camp run by a crazy person.  There's a fifteen year old kid who has tricked kids to come here to do farm work for a manual. And he punishes us whenever he feels like it. And if your mom were here, you would understand that you put your son in a dangerous situation, but instead you're sitting on a fancy couch in our home laughing at our son's serious health concerns.  Wow. Needless to say, the kid thanked me at the end. So how long was he there for, 14 days, 14 days? Well, he's five days in when he's five days in and I could read I got turn around in the next, you know what, nine.  Our message to them. Well, we took the phones once. Once I got the tip off. Right. We took the phones and there was no way out. And the message to them was, when you can't change your situation, you change yourself. You're fucking stuck here, figured out. And what I just read to you makes it sound a lot worse than it actually was.  I mean, was his private in. He was being dramatic. And it's hard work, but kids need it, you know, getting that base to understand that you can struggle and you can you can realize that sometimes when things are really hard to do, you think, oh, my God, I got to stop doing this. But once you do it and you complete it, you have a satisfaction, this sense of satisfaction that you did something really difficult that is irreplaceable.  Some kids never get that and they just stay fat and stupid their whole life. And some kids, they get these little lessons and then they realize, like, you can push yourself and you can get somewhere. You know, some kids get real lucky and they get involved in sports or martial arts early. And one of the best benefits of sports is you realize that through hard work, you get improvement. Through improvement, you get success through success.  You get that big dopamine rush, you get that good. You don't get confidence. You get this girl, you get sometimes I didn't. But you get this knowledge that you can do something that's difficult and you can overcome even though it feels like you can't. I get like that's one of the beautiful things about the belt system of martial arts. You start off as a beginner, you start off as a white belt, and then as things go on, you get a new belt and they when your instructor takes your old belt off and ties your new one off, you new one on your like, you have this amazing feeling of accomplishment like, wow.  And then you know that there's a goal. The end of the rainbow is a black belt. Like I might get to be a black belt some day. I came off. It's it's real possible.  And then, you know, other people that do get their black belt, you're like, wow, what's it like?  Like, you know, you see people do a little bit ahead of you in the race. Like, this is incredible. See how people the model of other other successful people to model, see those black belts.  You see disciplined people.  You know, when you talk about cold showers. When I was a kid, there's an there's a black belt when I was just starting out. His name is Bob Cafarella. When I was a white belt, he was a black belt and he was living at the school and he would take it. We lived in Boston. It was cold as fuck in the winter and this guy would take cold showers and we were all terrified of him anyway. But he would he should get in that shower.  And I just couldn't believe he could do it. It was so cold. And this is after training, right? You know, he would just get in there and just he wouldn't even budge. Just just sit there and breathe all that fucking. And I tried it one time I got in there, I turned that water on cold. I stepped in. I was like, fuck this. And I got out and I ran into the locker room and everyone was laughing.  I was like, how is he doing that?  But another level, some people, you learn from them, you know, you see these people that can over. Now, I take regular cold showers now would do cryotherapy. I get in 250 degrees below zero. And I stand there for three minutes. I wait ten minutes. I go back in there again. You learn how to overcome. You learn how to deal with.  You learn you wouldn't die. Right.  You also learn that it's not that bad. You just have. But you it's it's an opportunity to go inward. It's an opportunity to just to content to focus your your energy and your thoughts on the deepest aspects, the deepest center of your mind, and think about your breathing and think about that.  And don't think about the fact, oh, my God, it's so cold. Oh, my God, it's so hot. I'm dishonest. I've got to get out of there. Instead of thinking about that, just think about your breathing. Just goes just go deep. Close your eyes. Go go deep to the center of your mind and stay there. Just stay there and slide down. Yeah.  You learn, you learn how to do that or you don't. Or you stay fat, stay stupid. You stay lazy but maybe don't have any good.  Maybe you never had that chance. Maybe. Right. And that's why I wanted the kids there because they'll never get there, like you said, if they're not in a sport or whatever.  But when I found when all these texts were coming and my wife wanted to divorce me, all this shit was happening.  Just three, four weeks ago, I got in touch with a neurosurgeon and I said, would you talk to the kids? And the Naura surgeon said, which I didn't know you you probably know this. He said, kids, when you take on something hard, could be a cold shower, could be this fourteen day crazy camp.  Gel the belt system. If you don't finish it, it leaves a physical gap in the brain. Literally, we could see as a neurosurgeon the wires are unconnected.  You never finished it, but when you finish it, it leaves like train tracks.  And so the more tracks you could lay like you were Lanham as you were getting the belt system right, the advantage, you're gonna have an advantage over your competitors. So I thought that was interesting. Like kids need to do hard shit. Yeah. And they need to finish what they start to.  I think adults. We all do and everybody does. But kids need to learn it, you know, and many kids today don't learn it. You know, it's sad.  It is. It is sad.  And I think sports are really the best way for kids to learn it. Sports are the best way for. Because there's something about physical pursuits where you have to motivate the mind, has to force the body to plow through discomfort. It's a different kind of mental strength and there's mental strength in terms of like your ability to sit down and be disciplined and study and, you know, do homework assignments and incomplete projects and do complex, you know, problems and problem solving.  There's mental strength in that, too. But there's also the strength of the mind telling the body who the fucking bosses like.  None of that sentence. That's what it is. You're not a bitch. You got it. Your nearby is like, really? We've got to stop. Fuck you. What we're doing. Fuck you. Almost like you have to have two people in your brain. You have does this general. And you have to have a soldier. And the generals like, listen, motherfucker, we know what we're doing here. We're gonna get this done. This is what we're doing today.  You got a list of shit on that paper. It's gotta get done. It's 98 degrees outside and you're gonna do it out here in the sun. You got plenty of water. Let's go.  I agree with that C.T., obviously. Yeah, like that. Have to have that.  Well, he's the one we should tell everybody. He's one who brought us together, C.T. Fletcher. Then he also broke your kettlebell.  He also broke my cat about today. Your kettlebell at you had to get it welded today.  Literally, I show up at his place this morning to get some advice. I'm going to be talking to Joe Rogan. You know, you've madam, can you give me some advice? He grabs the kettle bell throws it like a tennis ball. Like, pretty hard to throw this thing. I'll forget that. He's a tank. Breaks it. Thank God there's a welding shop. Because you had said to me in attacks, hey, make sure you bring the kettlebell.  Some like going to shelter or a broken fucked well would be a funny story.  Show that with a broken one. But it's cool. It yeah. It welded.  No he's he's a general and a soldier. He's, he's an animal. Well he's one of the most inspirational people online. And then one of the most inspirational people I've ever met. And if you watch any of his videos, you know, he's just he's he's a special person.  And really, you want to talk about a guy who's gone through a journey after open heart surgery and having his heart replaced. Now he has a new person's heart. I still think he doesn't know whose heart it is. Right. He said he saw an older woman.  He had told me elderly woman. I got. Yeah, which is crazy. Crazy.  Knowing the size of his biceps and that, you know, the workout he puts me this morning, he he says we're gonna do this. How did he call it random selection. Get on the tricep push down channel. What do I do. Body weight stuff.  And I'm just going to dust aside, Joe, every ten reps. What? Wait, I'm changing it to. And he just kept changing change. We get to 100 reps. My triceps are on fire. He said, just so you know, when I was training to be world champion, I would start with 300 reps as a warm up.  So he's just an animal? Yeah, his his arms are ridiculous still to this day. He, like you, thinks he's lost muscle size. Like how the. How do you know fucking big your arms are.  He's a big boy. He's enormous. And when he was younger, he was really enormous. But he had a terrible diet, unfortunately.  And, you know, Burger King or McDonald's and the flour shakes, fries and shakes and just lost sugar, nonsense and bullshit. And, you know, when he was powerlifting, when he was enormous, you know, he was just deceit. Eat whatever the fuck you fell again. Getting after. Yeah.  You're a hunter. Yeah. So I got a hunting story. OK.  So I'm not a farm boy at all. But we I meet my wife, like I said, two thousand.  We buy the farm in Vermont. Why did you decide to buy a farm in Vermont? You know, I.  So where were you living at the time? So I will go back.  So I built the swimming pool business, turned into a little bit of a construction company somehow fight my way. Graduate college and meet a guy at at Cornell who says, what are you doing when you graduate? I said, I'm going back to neighborhood. And he says, we're fucking idea to go to Wall Street.  I don't know anything about Wall Street. I remember the 87 crash. I figured people don't make money there anymore. He says it's just like the neighborhood. Only they do it with a pen instead of a gun.  You've got to go. You've got to go to Wall Street. So he pushes me there and I and I, Alanah, Wall Street, get a job.  I eventually build a business, had a nice run.  And I just like you. I didn't want to be at a desk all day. I didn't like it. I didn't feel good. I started to gain weight. The folks around me, we were making a lot of money, but folks had psychological problems I couldn't fix.  Like, I can't believe John next to me got fifty thousand dollar more bonus than I did.  We're making more money than we deserve. Are you fucking crazy? Like, are you kidding me?  Right. Like, I had problems I couldn't fix, so I was dying to get out of there. I had a picture of a red barn on my desk. I just wanted to go to a farm. I don't know why. I just want to leave. Sold the business. Found a farm in Vermont.  Covered bridge. I did like the whole thing and meet my wife and. And we buy this farm and I got a tractor.  And just how long you been doing this? So two thousand and two. So 20 years ago bought the farm and then.  And you just decide Vermont on what? You know. It's gorgeous. I was on. I didn't know anything, I knew Queens, my wife, the girl I met was from Boston. I didn't really know if you're in Queens, you know Connecticut. I didn't really know Vermont. I'd skied in Vermont. You probably skied in Vermont. And I never have.  Know you're not. I did some gigs up there, though. OK. I was doing stand up. It's beautiful. It's cold as fuck to call it dawn.  And so we had gone on on a date. My wife and I to a friend in Idaho, we went out to Idaho for like a snowshoeing thing. And on the way back, I saw this real estate magazine in the plane and it had homes and ranches in Jackson Hole, which you got to be pretty wealthy to buy anything about twenty million.  Twenty five crazy numbers.  There was one ad in that magazine that said a farmhouse in Vermont covered bridge mountain horses.  Four hundred and twenty grand.  Like, why not? She's in Boston.  I'm in New York. It's a lot cheaper than fucking Jackson Hole. So islands up there to no one's up there. So we bought the place and we settled, then sold the business in New York and started making kids. I bought some Scottish Highlander cows and started to learn.  So those those weird hairy cow, big hairy cows, the big horns, epic looking.  I just get those. They're beautiful. They're just gorgeous for that reason. No reason. There's like woolly mammoth. How cool. Can go. Yeah. I got a regular cow.  Let's get let's get the. How did you get those. I just talked to a guy or another guy and a five fucking Scottish islands.  Now we had goats and chickens and trying to figure it all. One day the chickens came, the chickens come in a post office.  They deliver them. And so I got to have chickens.  What do you do with them? Right. I got one hundred and fifty five chickens. One hundred and fifty. I already checked Salala eggs. Eggs. So.  So you get roosters. Two roosters. Oh, I don't know what the fuck I was doing. Right. Just order more animals. All right. Bought a farm, I suppose, to have animals.  So anyway, I'm doing all this work to the farm.  I'm fixing up the old structures and stuff.  And I need somebody to do excavation to because we're going to the winter's comin and we're gonna flood the basement if I don't change the elevation of land a little bit.  Get the water to run away when it snows. But I can't find anybody do excavation because they're telling me it's it's hunting season and I don't hunt.  I don't know anything about hunting. And I said, somebody's gonna want a fucking job in Queens. You get any like you just tell somebody's looking for work.  Right. Got to find somebody.  So Guy says to me, look, there's I'll rent you a excavator machine. And I think I got a guy that will that will not go hunting and he'll run the machine. One guy. One guy. So I said I'd send them to me. So I rent the machine. Fuck, I can't remember his name, but I'll remember his name.  But anyway, he's operating the machine. It's a true story. This is gonna start the strip search and be fucking crazy. This is a Quentin Tarantino movie.  So the carpentry work on all the things I'm fixing up are done by some Slovakians that a guy sent me. I've got four Slovakians doing carpentry work in the background. I've now got Geoff. Is his name. I got this guy Geoff that's running the excavator. My wife just gave birth to our first child on a farm and we're like three weeks in with our first new baby. My mother in law is coming over to watch the baby and my wife and I are gonna go to dinner for the first time in a while.  We're gonna baby get out of the house. Slovakia's doing carpentry. Geoff, do an excavation. Mom's going to watch the baby. We're going to dinner. Pull up in front of the house five p.m. and grab my wife. Jeff, the excavator runs out to the front, sees me sweating profusely. I said, what's up? He said, Fucker, he's pacing back and forth. He says, You didn't let me go hunting because I've hunted my whole life.  OK. Get out with it. I gotta get my wife. I'm going to dinner. I couldn't help myself. I was operating the machine in the backyard and a deer ran by. I fucking jumped off the machine. I tackled it. It killed it with a handsaw. But okay, so I got tackled. I'm just telling you what he told me. There's a.  So what's the problem? I'm assuming the story is true. What's why are you sweating?  I didn't tell you. I'm on probation. Hunting season ended yesterday. If somebody sees the deer is not tagged. I don't know what any of this means. I'm going to get arrested. I'm going to bury the deer in the backyard.  I said, dude, I said, kill the deal with the hands. And so, so, so later on, the story from the locals said if that happened, the deal was probably wounded because it was just an hunting season just ended. It's probably move in slow. If he did that.  But you're gonna love this story gets more interesting.  I got to bury in the backyard. Don't bury the fucking deer. I got to take my wife to dinner, put it in the bucket of the backhoe. Right. Lift it up off the ground. I'll call a neighbor.  I'm sure nobody caught a deer. Let's show you how much I know about. Right. Caught.  Right. Nobody little. All right. Nobody caught a deer.  They'll want one. I'll just give it away. Wife gets in the car. I'm driving to dinner and I call Dave Fisher.  I'm remembering the name my neighbor. And I said, Hey, Dave. I got a deer in the bucket in my backyard. You know, I'm not going to get into how it got there. Yeah, I got it. I said, well, it's a pretty warm night. Should you get it now? Now get in the morning. Perfect. Problem solved. Go to dinner with my wife. Come back. Go to bed and wake up in the morning.  No deer in the back? No. Everything's great.  I go to the general store. There's only one general store in our town. It's the only place to eat. Go into the general store and the manager of the general store says, Hey, Joe, you want some venison for lunch?  I said, how do we have. How was their venison? Venison. He said, You never believe it. He says, Let late last night, the Slovakians were done doing the carpentry. They walked past the backhoe. They found a dead deer in the fucking backhoe. They dragged it here a mile. They dragged it to the general store, gutted it. And it's now in the freezer. I said, this is fucking stunning, unbelievable, this this fucking stories is crazy.  I said, I don't want any a senator fish. The neighbor happens to come in. Do not tell him about this, because now I don't know if I like I don't know the law with this. Right. You folks have a tag deer, not tag deer. Fast forward.  It's now Christmas time, right? Hunting season was November. It's now Christmas time. And I am stuck in New York during a snowstorm. I call a car service that I used to use when I was on Wall Street. There are a bunch of Turkish guys. They speak with very little English. You do want to drive me up to Vermont?  It's like a five hour drive with a snowstorm. Might be eight hours. Yeah. Tony. Tony, I'll take you. Drives me up. We're fifteen minutes from the farm.  He says Joe anywhere to get any deer up here. I said, can you believe this fucking guy's asking me this? I said, go to the general store, go see the manager. There's deer in the bale. Cut your piece.  Right. Again, I don't know. Right.  A week later, it's Christmas. It's the only time the Slovakians take off. They're taken two weeks off. They surround me in my garage and they're talk. They don't speak English. I call my friend in New York. I said, you've got to translate. I don't if they want to raise Ottenhoff, they don't want to work for us anymore. I don't know what it is, he says. They won't know where the fuck they're deer is.  That's what he's talking about. I call Michael at the general store. I said, Mike what? I'm the deer. He says, What do you mean? The Turkish guy came. He said he could have the deer. We loaded the whole deer in his trunk, frozen. He drove it back to New York.  Oh, boy. Fucking crazy story.  I gave I gave the address of the Turkish guy to this the.  I never I never heard from the Turkish guy again. I have no idea.  I probably shouldn't be saying it on the largest podcast network. So Viking guys went after the day away from my dear one there. So that's my that's my only story.  He could have a piece of deer and he told to hold the Huff's the fuck and had everything.  Oh, boy. And they had dragged it a mile to the store from the backhoe. And what about the neighbor who you told it was in the backhoe? Did.  She never asked again. David Fisher never asked again. Yes. Yes. The operator never to be seen again. The guy who killed the other hand, everything they're going to be seeing.  I don't buy that story unless it was really fucked up. There's no way you're catching a deer with your bare hands, which is what the locals said.  It was probably shot. Yeah, it was probably wounded.  The only time that could happen is if the animals in the ruts, sometimes when they're in the rut, the males go so crazy that there's a video. It's a crazy video of a guys in a blind. He's in a hunting blind. And this book is so out of it that he actually taps his antlers with the arrow. He's got an arrow in his hand. He taps it like tap tap in the box, like. He's just so out of it because they're so horny.  They lose their fuckin. It's very rare that they behaved like this, but they could work themselves up into such a frenzy that they're like they're like hallucinating. They don't know what the fuck's going on. They're not scared of danger.  Maybe it was a very haunted deer. They get really crazy. But I doubt it that this guy is going to kill it with a handsaw.  He sounds crazy, but eat an evil thing was crazy. The whole thing doesn't make any sense. Like, oh, hunter wouldn't. You're not bloodthirsty.  Like, you're going to jump on a deer with a saw, use a goddamn rifle. And the fact that this guy waited till the day after hunting, he was season was over and knew it and still killed it with a saw. That didn't make any sense. None of it makes any sense.  Yeah. That's why I would be a good movie.  Could be a good Coen Brothers movie. It would be a good call. Yeah, that would be a good movie.  Well, I bet a place like Vermont, you get a lot of those sort of Coen Brothers movies.  It's it's very hot on a fourth member funny farm. No, there was a movie with Chevy Chase where he lived in Vermont. That was Vermont, too.  Cue the deer. Remember that. How do people feel about Bernie Sanders up there?  I mean, it's very divided. There's the third generation Vermonter, hardworking farmer. And then there's all the New York, New Jersey, Boston transplants, very hippie, crunchy.  And those are the ones like Bernie Sanders of Bernie.  And I got I've got to be careful what I say.  But I would say this. I don't know what you're feeling is on this, but I would say it's much better when people work for a living.  Yeah. Yeah, I think it is to. Yeah. Yeah.  No, I definitely there's much better when people work for a living. I think what Bernie wants is people to earn a living wage for their work. You know, I think there's a lot of misconceptions about what he wants. Well, I don't think he wants to give people free money. I think he wants people to be able to earn a living.  And he thinks that there's a lot of greedy Wall Street people that are essentially stealing money, that we were definitely overpaid for our job, no doubt about it. I mean, the whole place is crazy. So I agree with that. But the other side of it, I think there's always the pendulum swings too far. The other side of it is in in Vermont. And again, I'm in a piss a ton of people off here. There's a lot of free stuff.  Free cheese, free phones, free this. I've had a lot of stories where people say to me, I haven't had this experience myself, where there's negative selection, where folks will come to Vermont because of all those free things. And what do you mean by freely?  Why are these their support? It said it's basically if you if you're below a certain level, a level of income, you get all the support.  And I'm not against supporting people. I mean, look, I open my farm up to the whole world, to kids, to people that are having trouble with weight.  But but I think you feel better when you earn it.  Kind of like you said, with the belt system. Like if you just walked into a judge and they just gave you a belt.  That's certainly true. I really feel better when you earn things. Yeah. So.  So that's my that's my only issue.  So how did you get started? How did you start the whole Spartan race thing? So I'm on the farm. I got one leg still on Wall Street. One leg on the farm was selling the business. I'm feeling overweight and out of shape. Let's go way back.  My mom introduces me to a 30, 100 mile run in Queens, New York, that still exists today. Thirty one hundred miles around a one mile loop.  Oh, my God. It's called the transcendence run. Even before that had a different name. But because she met the yogi and the yogi believed that human beings could do things much greater than they think they can. They're only held back by the limit of their mind. And we're gonna set up this running race, one mile loop, 50 to 60 days. And you're just going to transcend the past. We're just gonna go around and around around about seven to eight people do it a year.  I did not do it as a kid.  I'm very young kid, but I see it and it probably makes an imprint somewhere. My brain. Right. I'm on Wall Street.  I'm getting out of that business. I'm gone to the farm. My wife and I start racing myself. I start doing all these crazy races around the world, not 30, 100 miles, but crazy stuff. And I feel good.  Like you felt in the dojo, right. Is that the right term? You don't use that dojo.  And I feel alive like I'm sweating and working and eating healthy and kind of like I have.  I find that I have a boxing match coming up and it's forcing me to train for it. So. Right. I'm I'm waking up earlier. I'm I'm not drinking.  I'm going to. But I'm doing all the things I'm supposed to do because I got a battle coming and I had so much fun with it that I said, I want to do this for other people. I want to put on events and have them experience what I get to meet myself during those events.  I find out who I am. I get to places where I just want water, food and shelter. And I'm not worried about payroll and and all the bullshit of life or or dear's being buried in my back.  Right. I just I just want to just survive the next step. And could I do this as a business?  This would feel really purposeful. Kind of like you found your things and you felt good about. And so I put on the first race and it was like hell to get people there. It's kind of like the kids camp. I got a lot of people and say, this is gonna be fun.  It'll be like a barbecue, which it wasn't. And I'm going to just want to talk torture folks and put obstacles out there to be very military inspired. Got a cool name, Spartan and 500 people showed up than a thousand and fifteen hundred.  And two thousand. Ten thousand. Then we're one country. Two countries. Ten countries eventually. Forty five.  I was in a battle with a company called Tough Mudder. Nonstop battle about what? Well, they we were we were both in the same industry, right? And they were they were having races on the same weekends. I was having races. So if I'm out marketing, there are more. How do I convince people to come to my race and not their race in the same towns who were doing same town, same sometimes same location. So if we announce the location, then they would announce a similar location the weekend before the weekend after it was like.  So they were doing it on purpose. Yeah, we were. We were we were in a knockdown, drag out fights. So weird. Yeah.  For ten for ten plus years it was in the media. Was it was a big battle. And that battle forced me to be better as a business owner like.  Right. I should be on my toes. I had to I had to fight for us to survive and.  We ended up buying them and they're buying them pre colvard, which was the absolute worst time, can't seem to get anything right. But. But yeah, so so you bought them. Do you incorporate any of what they do into what you do? Or did you just buy them and just assume them?  We bought them. And we're the way I look at it and you tell me what you think. The way I look at it is we want to be the LVMH. The Louis Vuitton owns all these brands. Vail Resorts owns all these ski locations. We want to own all these different types of events that are basically the boxing matches for people. And so you could sign up and buy a season pass and you just choose your poison. I mean, to do this this month, I mean to do that that month.  And so I don't want to. They're not going to converge. Tough Mudder is gonna be its own thing, just like it was when we were fighting Spartan to be its own thing. We've got a couple other brands in there. Just trail runs this thing called DECA. And I'm really just trying to put dates on people's calendars like a boxing match does give them something to general sounds themselves to train for.  And hopefully they're like the boxers you describe that actually do the work. Yeah.  And I'll get people healthier because, well, there's something good about the fact that some boxers don't do the work yet to learn. When a guy shows up at a world heavyweight title fight at 280 plus pounds and everybody goes, oh boy, you young boxers go, don't be that guy. You know, there's there's lessons in people's failures. They're all there for you. It's all like there's there's knowledge out there, positive and negative. You can learn a lot from people's fuckups so you don't have to fuck up yourself.  I like that.  I like that. I mean, you're right. I like lazy people. Yeah. They make people that aren't lazy feel better. They make them look better. They make they make it more impressive.  You know, when you see a lazy person and then you see a guy like my friend Jarkko Chocho Willink and you go, okay, well, the guy's even more impressive getting F because I know people are just fuckups and they find a reason to not do what they should do.  Isn't it so. You tell me why isn't it so easy to stand head and shoulders above, like show up a little earlier. Right. Go to bed a little. Drink a little light. Like it's not that hard.  It's not that hard. Stand out to work hard. No, but, you know, in creative endeavors, that's what's weird. It's like croute creativity is a weird thing and there's some benefit in indulgence. Deep creative creativity is weird. Like some of the great artists, like here's a perv example. Stephen King, when he was at his best, was doing blow and drinking like a fucking case of beer a night does when he was at his best when he wrote Carrie and Kujo and he was out of his fucking mind.  Apparently, he doesn't even remember writing. Kujo really doesn't remember writing it. Yeah. He's just blasted out of his fucking mind. But what what happens in that funk of that fog of cocaine and alcohol and nicotine and and just dub mashing those keys and is digging into the deep recesses of his mind? I'm not convinced you could reach that on the natch. I don't know if you can think. I mean, there is discipline. The fact that he sat down and did that work.  There's discipline. The fact that he was there, but he wasn't taking care of himself. He wasn't drinking water and doing sit ups. He dark motherfucker would sit in front of that keyboard and torture himself with blow and write these masterpieces that to this day freak people the fuck out. You read Carrie to this day, like who wrote this? What is going on in this man? This man's mind.  But. But you're not. You're not suggesting. We all do. You're saying we've got a tremendous benefit as a society. Because that guy did that. I'm just saying that there's some. It's hard. There's no real.  When you're talking about creative things like Charles Bukowski is, another example is a fucking drunk man.  He wrote amazing shit. But that guy would just lay around drink and he would hit his girlfriend on camera like they were crazy. He was a crazy man.  But you read some of his work, you know, like, wow, this is genius shit.  There's something about that one undisciplined, fucked up but purposeful life that reached millions.  So I don't think there's a hard, fast rule.  I think activity and action are crucial. Right. Inactivity is always bad. Someone is lazy, sits around, does nothing, is always bad. But when it comes to creative endeavors, sometimes indulgence. Sometimes it's a lack of discipline because the work still gets done. But they're not taking care of themselves. It's not self care. But the results are spectacular.  You think it's the exception or the norm for those amazing like. Is it all. Is it all of them?  I think it's energy. I think we look at in terms of good and bad. And sometimes you can't look at things and you can't. Everything.  Some binary, you know, like if you wanna talk about a healthy person. Right. A perfect person who's running. A person who's competing in athletic endeavors. Well, that person has very specific requirements of. Their body, like, you know, she's going to run 30, 100 miles, man, mean she's as Christ, you're going to have to go through that running. You're going to have to you're going to have to be in shape. If you do the Mahlab 240, you know, you want to do that.  You want to run 240 miles through the fucking mountains.  But if you want to write a book, you don't necessarily have to do sit ups.  You know, you don't necessarily have to even be healthy. And there's some people who just want to write a book. And there's there's some weird energy to being drunk. You know, there's weird energy to smoke. And cigarettes is weird energy to taking amphetamines. There's weird energy to sitting in front of a computer and coming up with these ideas. It's not good for the body, but sometimes the results, like sometimes people sacrifice health and they sacrifice wellness in order to achieve creative goals.  It's not I don't know if it's required, but I just know it's been done. And the results for some people are amazing. This is nothing I would ever encourage, certainly never encourage my kids to do. It certainly would never encourage good friends to do it. But there's something about these people that have made some of the great works of art. Some of the great, great works of literature.  You know, they weren't healthy now. But one of the things that drove me crazy forever is as high level CEOs and business owners. Same thing.  Yeah, they might not have those big creative bursts. But they're under stress. They're eating shit, food, my dad was one of those eat shit food, right? Yeah. Focused nonstop on the business. You know, they they treat achieving in some cases, tremendous success. But I'm fucking dead.  I wonder if they would have achieved that success. If they had been eating healthy and taking care of themselves, and I wonder if they would have looked at things the same way. Like what? What is your ultimate goal? Is your ultimate goal numbers in a bank account?  Or is your ultimate goal to feel good outlive your competition? Yeah, I guess, I mean I mean, don't you want. I love this term health span right from the moment you wake your life to the moment you die. Just be healthy, right? You don't want to like that. The last 20 years in the hospital is not a yeah. It's not a good one.  Right. Like relative health is interesting, too. You see, goes 90 and you know, he's running marathons like, wow, that's something to aspire to.  But if you were 30 and all of sudden your body was that 90 year old marathon runner, I'd be like, what the fuck happened to me? You'd be you'd hate it, right? Like, it's not really healthy. No, it's just healthy for 90. It's healthy for 90. Yeah. Yeah. I just want to feel good. Yes. I just want to feel good. So so I mean, I look at this 92 year old guy, Bysshe, I told you about.  That's on the fruits and veggies. He's like sharp. He his argument is, look, he goes on this diet.  You're not getting biceps. You're not gonna look like S.T., right?  Yeah, but I mean, outlive people. But sweetie's vegan. c.D, let me.  It doesn't like that word. He told me this morning. Said he liked the plant based. Yeah. Because the kids are all using that word. Now, that's a new word. Plant based and zie and only plants. So he said he's vegan now. He's vegan, but isn't like the word. Yes.  Oh, well, the word is it's attached to a lot of annoying people, you know. Yeah.  Which is what? He said if you use that word, you tend to like, lean on other people have become bigos.  I don't give a fuck what other people do. I'm I'm trying to make sure this heart lasts.  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. I don't know if that's the way to go to make your heart last. You know, there's a lot of variables and there's a lot of people that have differing opinions. A lot of experts have differing opinions in terms of nutrients that you're not going to get and, you know, and how to get those nutrients and how to make sure that the protein that you're getting is bioavailable, that you're getting a full suite of vitamins with everything you know, with all your meals and making sure all your bases are covered.  It's tricky.  Do you think it certainly can be done, though?  Well, do you think here's my thought on it. And again, I had my mom push in for 30 years. Right. The diet, which I was pushing back on because I wanted the raviolis and and the meat.  If if you're a tenth generation or 20th generation from a particular place on the planet that aid a certain way for 20 generations and their survival of the fittest. Right. Like those that couldn't last on that diet died off. And like, you're probably have a predisposition to eat that way in that part of the world.  I would think there's certainly a good argument for that. Right. Yeah, there's a there's a genetic argument for your diet in terms of, you know, they can do they can sequence your genome and go over your your your history and subscribe or prescribe to you a diet that's based on your ancestry.  It's controversial. You know, it makes sense, though. It does in some ways. Yeah. But it's all anecdotal, you know. And then also different people. That's the problem, though, with biodiversity. Like people of different need, like some people do great on just fish and rice and veggies. Other people really, they they need more protein. They need more meat. They dates. They survive better on a red meat based diet. Some people, they survive better on just eggs and vegetables.  I mean, it's like. But I think the most important thing is you have to have your nutritional bases covered. This is so important, man. There's so many people who need to check and. Well, check out. Yeah. There's so many people go through life. Vitamin D deficient. I mean, that is like one of the most common ones. That's one of the big ones with Kofod. Yeah. More than 80 percent of the people in multiple studies, 80 percent of the people that were in the ICU with Kofod had vitamin D deficient level, which most of us.  I think most of us. Yes. Only four percent had sufficient levels. Wow. Which is crazy. Right. So, I mean, that doesn't, you know, correlation and causation. It doesn't exactly mean that vitamin D is going to protect you. But it is it's crucial for health. And it's it's a vitamin. That's actually also, according to Dr. Rhonda Patcher taught me this, that it's also a hormone, you know, and it's you know, it's something that.  It's crucial. And then most people don't get it, and if you if you stay inside all day, you definitely don't get in. And African-Americans have an even harder time getting it because their ancestors, yeah, their ancestors developed all this melanin in their skin because they were consoli exposed to sunlight. And the melanin was there to protect you from the sunlight. So they didn't have to worry about absorbing the vitamin D because they were out there all the time.  Well, as the you know, as people move into colder climates and climates that are cloudier, that's why people got paler. They got paler because your body became essentially like a fuckin giant solar panel for vitamin D because you couldn't get it. You needed it. Yeah. Yeah. You had it. Look at the people who live in the places where it rains all the time. They're white as fuck. That's why I mean, it's real simple.  It's a survival mechanism for vitamin D for the one thing, like my doctor told me that when he was measuring people, he would measure black folks in New York and some of them had undetectable levels of vitamin D, which is insane.  Wow. Because you're in the winter, right?  You're covering your body completely. You're not going outside and you're also not supplementing now.  So. So let's go into diet.  So for me, for me, I got into these crazy races and my diet that I believe hopefully it wasn't just a mental thing. It was more fruits and veggies. And so if I made a food pyramid, the very top of the pyramid would be, you know, fish, eggs and meat. But just 15 percent of my diet, the rest was like avocado salad. I got I performed fantastic on that diet.  That sounds great for you. But for me. For me. And you tried different ways. You tried like more meat, more fish, less meat, less vegetables. You use the idol.  And this is primarily me. Fruits and vegetables for you. Yeah, primarily fruits.  I would say more veggies. Well, if you think about what you're doing, I mean, that makes sense. Or you're doing a lot of endurance stuff, you know, and a lot of endurance stuff requires a lot of carbohydrates. You know, also you're getting a lot of vitamins from all those vegetables. A lot of minerals from all vegetables. Yeah.  Makes sense. And a little bit of meat.  And when I did an event in Fiji once the Fijians are a phenomenal rugby players and we were out there like literally in the jungle of Fiji and animals, these guys are like ripped. And they had the machetes and bare foot. And they're going from like for them to go to see a friend at another village. It's like a 15 mile hike. And they would kill a cow. They'd eat mostly Vashi vegetables, but they would kill a cow once every six months.  They'd at all eat the island. Yeah. Everything, you know. And they would they would poke a hole in the cows neck and like, mix a little milk. We lug with the blood. Drink it up until a point where they killed it. But I would say they were not. They were more veggies than, you know, they need that cow once every six months. But up to then it's like all veggies. And there were these guys like, was that because of necessity, though?  Yes. Yeah. But that's because that was what was available is available.  No, they didn't have a Whole Foods or car or TV or anything. Yeah.  I mean, it's real clear that people evolved in to adapt to their environments, like whatever their environments were. And if you were letting a plant rich environment and you know, well, there's a lot of people that live in the jungles of South America that prefer monkeys. That's like their favorite thing to eat. Yeah. My my friend Steve Rinella actually went to Guyana and was hanging out with these tribes and they would kill a monkey. And they were so excited and there was smoke the monkey and cooking in the soup.  And that was their favorite thing to eat. They preferred it over everything you eat.  A monkey would have never eaten a monkey. I'm lucky I don't want to eat a primate. My my friend David Choe, who's an artist, was just in Africa and he was staying with a tribe. And their primary diet is baboons because they he sent me some pictures. I don't know if I can use them so I won't post them to you.  But he sent me some pictures of these people cooking up baboons who said that the people like miners and people that are out there that have killed essentially so many animals in that area, they've depopulated that area so badly that baboons are like the last thing left. So that's what this this tribe hunts. Fuck. Yeah, right.  I don't want to eat. I take a salad. You take a salad over Babbo.  Yeah, but if I was if I needed to survive, you do what you gotta do. Yeah, I do what you gotta do. Yeah. Let's go back to. You're OK with it.  Yeah.  Let's get out as a dog. Let's get out of this. Some dark about primates. Right. Right. Yeah. Why is that. Because it's our hands stance.  We're related to them in some sort of a strange way. It's like cannibalism. Yeah. I've read a lot about a Native American history. And one of the more disturbing things is how prevalent cannibalism was and how prevalent cannibalism was, where they would kill their enemies and eat them and roast them over the fire and and, you know, and sometimes eat them while they're still alive.  Was that you think that was part of, like, the reward? I don't know, man.  Some of it was just survival. I mean, when you're you're. Talking about people that evolved first, primarily without horses. Right. So, like without horses, for who knows how many thousands of years until the Europeans came. When the Europeans came, they taught him horseback riding and then they started stealing horses. And then they started raising horses and they started getting better at riding horses and doing battle on horses than any of the Europeans were. Like the Comanches were far better on horseback than any is one of the main reasons why the West was so difficult to settle, because the Europeans, the settlers only had muskets, single shot to you like, you know, 30 seconds to fuckin reload, whereas the Comanches can unload 30 arrows in that time.  You know, in probably 30 seconds, probably more. They probably unload 40 or 50 arrows in 30 days. Time to load one. Yeah. And you're dead. You're fucked. And they could fight on horseback. The Europeans hadn't figured out how to fight on horseback. They would climb off the horse to aim the rifle and then shoot it. And then they'd have to reload the Comanche, just run up on them and shoot from horseback.  So the idea that these people who grew up in this place or evolved in this place where they didn't have horses, they eat whatever the fuck they could. They came here on foot from Asia. Right. And a lot of them came through the Bering Strait like they ate whatever they could. Now it was survival.  And if you you had a war with a neighboring tribe and you killed them, that's a lot of money. I mean, we had a lot of meat. Yeah. What you gonna do? You gonna just let it rot?  Yeah. Or you could just eat them and come up with some reason why you're stealing their soul or whatever it would is cook them over far.  I got to saying that's fire ready aim rather than, you know, aim ready, fire and eat. It sounds like you've got a lot of knowledge in this area, but my thinking is aim ready. Fire came from like 30 seconds.  Hello. I'd like you to want to miss that shot. Right. Right.  But today we've got the ability to, like, shoot a lot if you use it as an example in business or whatever, like, fuck it, take shots.  Right.  Where's where's the mindset I think is. Slow down.  Aim. Get. But you never take the shot. Could you talk yourself out of it. I'm I gonna start this business. I'm going to do this new job. I'm going to do this. I'm not going to do that. I just take lots of fucking shots.  Well, that seems like it's going to suit your personality, though, right? Yeah, I think some people are more calculated, more German, perhaps more Germans slowly engineer this situation and figure out how to do it right. And what what's feasible and was not feasible. You know, I think the idea that's important is action. Do things. Yes.  Actually do things to procrastinate, sit around and debate things forever before anything gets done. Yeah. There's a there's a proper balance, though, of enough action and enough thinking.  But if you if you if you get ready and you're aiming. You don't tend to get into action when I fire, right? When I once when I tap, tell somebody to fire first and commit to that event that boxing. Right. It sends it sends things into motion. Like, all of a sudden now you're doing a bunch of shit because fuck. You said you were starting a business next month, right?  Right. I could see that. Yeah. Especially if you're not doing anything currently. Yeah.  The problem is like how much like the people that do too many things. That's almost as bad as not doing enough things.  That's fair. It spread too thin. I would be in a view if you were my coach, you'd say I do a little too many things. Do you think you do too many things? I do too many things. Yeah.  So what what makes you know that. But yet continue to do it.  I just need. Like, why would I possibly throw a kids camp in the mix. Darn cold that. I got 300 events. I got to reschedule across 45 countries and test the kids I had.  You had to do that? Nope.  Just reached reached out to the pledge. So terrible. You got a test. Go man. How come you didn't test them.  I, I yeah I fire ready. Aim. I am. But do you worry about health consequences by means getting sick.  We're making it sound much worse than it is. They woke up early. Big deal every fucking.  But I'm not worried about that. I'm worried about they will all be together and they're all I mean we're in a pandemic class all.  Test them that way. I'm sorry. I. I thought you meant test them physically. Oh, no, no, no, no. I meant test. Yes, of course. Yes. OK.  OK. I thought you might like it. How many push ups did they do.  No, no, no, no, no. I'm sorry. I used it. I didn't wasn't very specific. We test the shit out of people here. Yeah. We get tested every week and we consult.  When you did my test when I came in, it was what? A rusty knife. I thought that was a little weird. That's how we do it now. Retired. Retired. Doing it with a clean utensil.  What? What's your feeling uncovered?  Well, it's it's clearly a real problem. I mean, clearly very contagious and for some people is no big deal to shake it off. Pro athletes seem to have very little problem with it. Like a lot of NBA players, although I do know of one NBA player that got it. He's 28 years old and he got it three months ago. And he still is not back up to the endurance level that he was before he got it. He's still having lung issues.  You know, it's a fucking crazy. It's rare, though. It's rare.  Yeah, but I mean, you could be one of those rare ones, right? It's a fucking weird disease, man. And I think one of the reasons why it's a weird disease is probably because it was manipulated in a lab using one.  Yeah. I mean, I don't know. Right. But when I talked to my friend Brett Weinstein, who is a biologist, he explained scientifically that all that there's all these points, all these things you could point to about this virus that indicate that it's been manipulated, that it evolved too quickly. The jump from animals to humans is too quick and that this specific type of virus, they were working on it in that lab that a level four lab in Wuhan, it's more likely, he said, given what we know about the virus, that it was released or escaped or accidentally released from that lab.  Couple of military guys I spoke to think it escaped it. That's right. But I mean, China is pretty pissed off at us, right? I mean, whether it's justified or not.  Well, we're in a battle. They but but I mean, they didn't release it in America. They released it on their own people. I don't think they released it on purpose. I think it's I think that would be really creepy. And I think if they were gonna do that, they would be really calculated and they would release the vaccine ready to go and put it.  Yeah. And they would do it in Manhattan right now and then vaccinate their own people and then fuck up our economy. And that's what that could have happened. You know, not this time. But I mean, that that is a possibility. What is possible. Yeah, right. Exactly. That's what I meant. That's like a civilization could engineer a pandemic.  And in in, you know, infect another civilization. Powerful as a weapon.  Oh, my God. Look at it. Crippled the whole world, crippled the whole world, crippled our economy. That and we are the worst at it if you look at all the other countries. No one's done a worse job at dealing with this pandemic than us.  You think it works, but I think it exposed our weaknesses. Sure. Right. Our health weaknesses, our financial weaknesses exposed a lot of our weaknesses. Yeah. A little risk now.  Right. You know, there's shit going on.  Well, you know, that was there's that's that's like a bunch of compounding factors. Right. You know, you have the George Floyd murder and then you have the protests afterwards which ignite. Most likely is one of the factors in the kick up of the virus. Again, the second wave of it. You know, there's a lot going on, you know, and then also people don't like to be told what to do here. So while I fuck you, I'm gonna go out.  Fuck you. I'm gonna spring break. Fuck you. I'm going to Florida. Fuck you. I'm not wearing a mask.  I am. We got a call. I, I took the approach of we could put on a safe event the second that I get a state or a country that allows us to put on an event. We're back on and we're gonna put protocols in place because. I believe I don't fight me on it. I know what your thoughts are, but I believe that you're more likely to get like we're sitting right now as opposed to being outside. And I want you healthy.  That's pretty much established. You're more likely to get it inside. Sunlight kills it. And then the people have said, well, sunlight kills it in the protest. It wouldn't of spread in the protests. Not so fast.  You're talking about 50000 people packed, packed on top of each other, screaming the idea that the sunlight is going to kill all of it. It seems ridiculous. And it's also going to get into people and they're going to bring it to their home. And that's going to get to them. They're going to go to work.  They're going to give it to other people at work or other people wherever gathering's that they get to whenever you get it. You haven't like the way someone described it recently. It's like a music festival in every city all across the country for weeks at a time. And that's what the protests were like. I'm sure it had an impact. And if you looked at the numbers, like so many of the people that have it now are young people. I think bars had a big impact on it, too.  I think a lot of, you know, drunk talk in bars right on top of each other indoors. You know, you're drinking, your inhibitions are down. You're not thinking, you're not washing your hands. You're Yalon. You know, you're talking loud, sloppy, sloppy. Yes.  So so we get a call from Florida. Florida doesn't have Florida give a fuck. Jacksonville. I was definitely on the side of you said Joe. What's your stance on the whole thing? My stance was. I think we should shut down for a period of time to get the hospitals and our and our medical system in shape. But I'm just not a believer that you could shut down an economy for as long as we like. It has. And it has some negative consequence.  It's got a big negative impact. Right. Like people people lose their shit sitting indoors for, like forget about money and everything else.  You start to lose your mind, know. Right. So. So I'm putting a race on. I decide we're shooting down there. We put all the protocols in place. I'm a little annoyed because it's not going to be the race I'm used to where everybody's like like getting together in a festival area and I can't have, like, mud pits where we're mingling people. So I don't know how it's gonna go.  I drive with my family. I got to be there. If I'm from the leader of Disorganize, I got to be there driving my family down the East Coast when I get to South Carolina.  There's no virus does like corn dogs and party in and like beaches full of tea all the way to Florida.  It was no, it was completely different than New York and everywhere else, like it was game on.  So it's not shocking that the virus is huge down there.  Yes, it's a virus. You know, they said Florida, if it was a country, would be the fourth highest rate of infection in the entire world.  I got to tell you. And I'm not self-serving. We put on a good, safe event, really good event. And so far, knock on wood, no issues. But like, there was no protection, no protocol, nothing down in the states down there.  Do you impose tests on the. We did tests all all of our employees. We we tested with the swap that, you know, touch touches your brain. Yeah. With the swab, unlike your your rusty knife on my hand. Did you. Temperature checks, the temperature checks with everybody. We kept everybody distance.  I'm not I'm not just saying it because, like, my team went overboard. It was annoying to me at how at how good they did it and can't make money like that because I can't I can't get enough people in the event to. Right. I got to space them out.  And how many people did you know so event.  Normally we'd have 8000 thousand at that event. Call a couple of thousand. So I can't I can't make those numbers work. But I thought it was important because there's fifty thousand events around the world that are shut down. New York Marathon, Boston go down the list.  And if we could provide like a path to, hey, this could be done.  It was important to do, but it's not.  Fifty thousand events have been shut down. Fifty thousand around the world. That crazy. We are the hardest hit industry because we're not like a restaurant where I could deliver food like I'm dead.  Right. That I'm out of business. Right. Right. I got to keep paying people. So how many events do you normally run to you?  Three. Twenty five. Forty five countries. Three hundred twenty five events. And I'm down.  I'll be lucky. I'll be lucky if we have 20 this year. 20 from 325. So 305 down, down. Tough, tough year. I wonder when this is going to turn around. Do you think it's going to take a vaccine?  I mean, I'm looking at Sweden.  I don't know what you're feeling is on Sweden, but I think to that warrior call we spoke about at the very beginning of this conversation where I had all the people from around the world chiming in, looks it looks to me I know people are gonna listen to this and say, Joe, you're crazy.  Sweden's got the more deaths than Norway and other Nordic countries. But but when you look at the charts, you look at the number of people infected in Sweden versus the number of people dying, like.  And no one should die. I'm not suggesting anybody should die.  But like, it looks like it worked its way through the system and they didn't shut down.  Now, granted, they're in good shape, unlike us, right. Sweet Swedes are in good shape. They socially distance anyway. They keep their distance, not like us. They're not huggin as much as we do and shaken hands. But it looks like it worked.  They also have a different society over there. They're there.  They mostly have small villages. You know, you have Sweden, you have Stockholm. So spread out. Yeah. So you have some some urban areas, but you have a lot of areas that are spread out and they're small villages. Yeah. Nuts.  They're a little more like Vermont. Yeah, exactly. And Vermont has almost no cases. Really. Yeah. Yeah. It's and it's just not a high population of people.  No, but but maybe I'm an optimist. I'm a very optimistic guy. Maybe this thing's just got to work its way through because even if you get a vaccine. I happen to be close with a gentleman that's invested in one of these companies coming out with the vaccine, Modano. And even if you get the vaccine this year, let's just say. Right, you get it.  You know how Americans are with vaccines.  They don't even want to take the flu shot. Right. So is everybody going to all of a sudden take the vaccine or do we just have to stay shut for another year? Like, you can't. The only way out of this, again, people are gonna be pissed off.  The only way out is just get on with our lives. Well, the thing that I've been harping on, maybe too much, is that there's no emphasis whatsoever from our government about taking care of your health.  I'm not number one, Prepon. I mean, come on. That's what I live for. I know it. But it's weird that there's no discussion of this at all because they're afraid of shaming people for being obese. They're afraid of shaming people because their diet. So they have avoided the discussion completely.  That were me if you were president. OK. And I was your adviser. We'd be fucked in this girl's fucked.  Now, President Joe and Vice President Joe, you have their own problems.  I'm your adviser. Tell me what you agree with or disagree with one. Let's get everybody a bit early. Everybody go to bed early.  No freedom. I'm all for freedom. Again, I go back to Stephen King. That motherfucker wrote some great shit. Do have Kool-Aid. I'm drinking like a fish. Freedom leads to Doritos.  And at least it also leads to carry great works of art. How do we get both?  You don't you get freedom. You get both because of freedom. You know, you give people freedom and you get a lot of things. You know, this is the problem with this disease is this is not like anything else, you know?  I mean, you can't compare it to the flu. You can't because it's clearly more infectious.  And there's you know, there's flu shots. People can even if you have a flu shot and it's for the law, wrong strain the flu. There's enough in that that will protect you at least a certain amount from whatever flu. There's nothing like that for this. So all you got is vitamins and nutrients and in health and sleeping.  So when you say, all right, let's get him healthy, your president and you want freedom, which I agree with freedom. But freedom has led to like when I lived in Japan, I land anywhere in the United States as a matter what airport I land in. People are three times the size. I don't want to say that about my American brothers or sisters, but like, you know, three times the fuckin size.  True. I know. I lived in Vancouver come to get back to America three times the size. Yeah, I lived in Singapore. Come back to America three times the size. Like we got a problem.  We do. But that's also look, the American diet's terrible. The average American diet is terrible. I mean, eating milkshakes and fries and soda and the massive amounts of sugar is what's led to people being enormous, massive amounts of calories and sedentary lifestyle. It's all terrible, but it's on all of us. I mean, look how many people are in the crossfire. Look how many people are injured. Look how many people are injured. And though it's a small percentage, but that's what freedom gets you.  There's a small percentage of people who are going to excel. Does that mean that's just part of that's part of the recipe of exceptionalism you've got. If you're going to have a you get to give people the ability to do whatever the fuck they want.  All right. You're going to have some people that are going to ruin their lives because they have an open mind to this one.  I'm not saying this is right. I gonna beat this up. What if you're president? And I whispered in my ear and I said, all right, Joe, if you won't accept getting rid of the Doritos.  Can we at least have an FDA?  That's not.  In other words, a department that just doesn't allow factory farming, doesn't allow bullshit foods, maybe put a sugar tax on things.  OK. Factory farming, I think, should be a crime because I think it's a crime against nature. I think what they do to those pigs, when you see pigs stuffed into those cages, stand up their own shit and then the shit and piss gets filtered out into a giant pond that's outside of it's filled with methane, came in, drive by. It can't drive with the smell is horrific. Right. That that's a crime. That's a crime.  And that's a crime. They're letting them get away with because it's profitable. That's what I think. That's what I say. How so?  Again, how do you have laws to protect them? They have ag gag laws of your work in there.  You can't film this if you work in there and you're horrified by it and you film it.  You are in trouble because they don't want anybody seeing that. Exactly. We'll see that. I like you and I don't want to eat the backbone. Exactly. So. So what do we do? How do we stop it?  Well, that there should be laws against there should be laws against that. And that that is part of what fuels fast food, because in order to get cheap meat, you're going to have to do something. You going to have to figure out a way to stuff these animals into these pens. And you're gonna have to maximize your profit. And that's that's how that's how it got to the position that it's in right now. Should have never gotten there.  But now that it's there and now we know about it, we've got to pull it back. And if that means that these fast food places are gonna have to jack up prices and they're gonna have to use organic free range beef and instead of, you know, these the shit that they're serving people now, well, then that's what's going to have to happen.  And if things are more expensive than people realize, well, this stuff is better for you. But now it costs more. You know what? I can go to the supermarket and I get cheaper. And I could cook it myself and I can. And maybe we could wean people off of this fast food. The idea that we have to heat eat fast food is fucking crazy. But then you've got people that live in these poor neighborhoods and, you know, you can get a Big Mac for, what, a couple of bucks to fill you up?  That was. My next question so. So I like it. I like what you're saying, so now all of a sudden it's cheap, it's more expensive, a Burger King, McDonalds or Pizza Hut, whatever. Right. It drives people to make their own food. But but a lot of the neighborhoods, which a large part of America can't afford it. How do you sell that? That's a good question.  That's a real good question. I mean, that's the real problem is poverty. Right. The real problem is and the real problem is these impoverished neighborhoods that have been like that forever. And it does. They don't seem to be changing. How do you fix it, especially now when people can't work? You know, there's this is a real problem right now. Things are not just stagnant. They're deteriorating. So people can't work.  So. So I'm in our little game. We're playing. I'm your adviser. Don't tell me. Go fuck myself.  But there's a lot of generals and colonels and folks from the military that retire each year.  And what if we took all those inner cities, those tough those tough neighborhoods?  And we said, hey, you got you had a great career. You're retired. You get paid today in your life. Go take over that neighborhood. Clean it up. Would that be viewed by the public as like a military state? Certainly would.  I mean, look what's going on in Portland. You know, in Portland, they sent the Department of Homeland Security to try to break up the riots and they're calling them riots. Now, finally, you know why? Because the Portland mayor got teargassed and they told him to fuck himself. Like kids are yelling at him. Fuck you. Retire debt, right? Yeah, well, yeah. He's like, oh, this is great. Cause he thought, I'm gonna be I'm going to be one of the people and I'm going to go there.  They're throwing water bottles at him and I don't know what they want. I don't know what they want. But they were telling them, you've got to resign.  Fuck you, Mayor. It's crazy. And then the Department of Homeland Security people were mason him. They.  So how do you decide how do you how do you go into I mean, you got to use the military.  I just don't think that's that. I just don't think you do that. I mean, look, what they're trying to do is Portland's a different story because you're trying to break up looting, smashing windows. Attacks on federal property. That's sort of a different thing.  And I don't I don't think I don't really I'm not educated enough to decide, nor have I really sat down, thought about it, whether or not they need the Department of Homeland Security to break that stuff up. I don't know what's going on up there, but I do know that the mayor, who is in support of what he was called peaceful protests is now like is a riot.  Yeah, I mean, they were screaming at him. Well, he's the guy that's on their side. He let anti foot take over the streets and they're throwing water bottles at him. They're like, fuck you.  Yeah. I mean, I don't think you would. I'm not a believer. You're not I don't think you're a believer. And like, you can't let people do illegal things.  I don't care what it's for. You can't let people destroy property. You also can't let people like these mass gatherings have become violent and they think they're doing it for a good cause, but totally directionless. Like, what are they trying to do? The trying to take over the federal court buildings. What are they trying to do? Look, look what happened in Seattle where they took over those six blocks, that Charles area. Look what happened in there.  They started beating people up. People got shot and killed. They wouldn't let anybody in. They put borders up. They developed their own security system. And then when people were violating that, they were kicking their ass.  They were literally physically assaulting people in the name of this new utopia, like they did a way shittier job of governing that spot that America does the feel like Hong Kong.  It's everything we saw in Hong Kong. Yeah, it's fucking chaos out there in some of these, especially the Pacific Northwest.  And I wonder how much that has to do with they don't get any sun because they could go back to vitamin day. That's part of why they're so depressed up there. That's been documented. That's why depression I mean, seasonal of depression, disorder. And I know that that's that's up there.  So, so so what do we do with the Doritos and let them have it?  You have to you know, you can't put a sugar tax or.  No, no, no, no. You should educate people. Look, I don't eat Doritos. Well, how come other people do that? Well, I mean, I'll have occasionally ham occasionally, but I don't I don't meet them everyday. If I did, I'd be fat. It's real simple, but we don't say this, you know, like in the dream. I think it's a discussion problem.  Sure. Yeah. Look, how much time do we spend talking about certain issues that we have? Whatever whatever those issues are. And how little time do we spend? Halloo little time. Does our own government spend talking to us about our diet, talking to us about like the literally one of the most important things.  Even doctors don't talk about our diet. They don't know anything about it. The amount of time that the average physician spends in medical school studying nutrition is minuscule. It's tiny unless that person's actually studied, unless they're they their actual education is in nutrition.  There's very little studying of it. When you when if you're a doctor that's a general practitioner of your doctor, that's an orthopedic surgeon. How much time, unless you're independently studying it, how much time in medical school do they spend studying nutrition? Very little.  She's crazy because that's the root cause of most of these diseases. Yes. Right.  But we do we fix problems. We don't find the source of the. Problems and solve them. Yeah, it's. But some people do. So for those some people, you know, you can learn from those. Some people. And there's a ton of them out there.  And let those inner cities might not be getting that information. They're not. They're not.  So I don't know that they do have cheap food in the form of fast food. And it's everywhere. And also provides jobs for people that live there.  So do you subsidize that? Man, I don't know, man. That's a good idea. That's a real good question. The problem is people are addicted to those foods, too. So you'd have to get them off of that when you see someone who's obese. Almost always. They're addicted to some sort of terrible food.  Well, and it's always I know you love freedom and I love freedom. That's why we both live in this country.  But it's not a fair fight. If if I'm not against I'm not a conspiracy guy or. But like I was on Wall Street. And if you're a Burger King or one of these big public companies that's making food, that's not so healthy. Like, you got scientists, you got Madison Avenue advertisers, you've figured out a way to get into our psyche.  Yeah, well, you can't live without that thing, you know. Right. So that's not a fair fight. Yeah, there are. They're in there and they're not dead now.  Right. But they used to be able to advertise for cigarettes. They can't do that anymore. They they stopped that. It's interesting because you can still advertise for, like, Jack in the Box. B can advertise for cigarettes. But obesity kills as many people as almost any.  So that's all I'm saying. Would you cross the line? Like, were you annoyed that you can't advertise for cigarettes?  Is that taken away a freedom? Good question. It's a discussion. The problem with those those ads is a lot of them were at least initially very deceptive. You know, they made it look like Marble Man. Yeah, marble man.  I want to. I want to. I wanted to be like, damn right. The guy died of cancer.  So, I mean, there's no ads where you see these shitty foods with obese people getting sick. No. No. Right. They're making you feel good. Yeah.  I wonder if, like, for every good ad, you would have to have a bad ad. Like, you don't like that ad. I like that. Like so.  But every good ad for Burger King had you could hire like a company that would make a creative, very compelling ad showing fat people having heart attacks and literally lighting shit for or even or even a motivating one to do something healthy.  Yeah. I'd be better. The best motivation is always positive. Right. But sometimes not for some people, particularly for people that are addicted. Sometimes the wakeup calls death's door. You get to death's door, you have that heart attack. You're like, oh, my God, I've got to fucking clean up my life. S.T. Yeah, right.  And, you know, I mean, I think S.T. had underlying genetic genetic conditions, which many, many people do have. It's only been their fault. They just have for whatever reason, they just have a history, genetic history of heart disease. That is very weird, but it certainly is exacerbated. And he'll tell you that by his diet. Yes.  That that was that doesn't mean you're definitely going to die because your parents did of that kid. You could make some lifestyle choice.  Yes. Yes. You could strengthen your health for sure in multiple ways.  What's a typical day look like for you from a health and wellness standpoint? Like like.  Well, I'm lucky that I enjoy doing things. Physick healthy things. Yeah. I am back. Yeah. So because I have this long history of exercise. It's like it's just so now normal part of my day. And if I don't do it I don't think right. Like if I don't do it, I'm not calm. So it fucks up everything else. So the fucked up podcast for me when I was doing standup before covered it was would fuck up, stand up like you can't be in a bad mood.  And for me, the best solution to a bad mood is hard workouts and hard workouts. Cure it all, man. A heavy bag, smoke a joint, hit that heavy bag, play some Hendrix, just whack the shit out that heavy bag and then after it's over, man, I feel great. I love everybody.  Doesn't smoke in the joint, doesn't slow you down. It gives you energy. Now it just makes me conflictive. Makes me think more. Makes me paranoid and makes me more compassionate. It is like there's a lot of weird stuff about pot. And one of the things that people don't like is like, oh my God, I just feel paranoid.  I think that's hyper aware. That's what it is like. Cause really, you should kind of be more paranoid than you really are. I mean, were these water balloons of flesh with these fuckin breakable sticks that keep the structure together? Like wandering around, driving 60 miles an hour and these metal boxes with rubber tires over this artificial road that we've created and covered the earth with?  We're fuckin weird, man. Pretty complacent. Yeah.  When you describe it that when we're in space and we're on this ball that's spinning a thousand miles an hour, hurling through it towards infinity fire by the sun, and we're not going to be here for very long.  You know, that's the other thing. You have a short amount of time here and you're trying to navigate this time the best you can, trying to be nice and have a good friend and be a good neighbor and be a good husband and the father and all those good things and a big, good wife and just a nice coworker. And you're trying to just do your best. It's complicated. And you're you're interacting with all these different people, with all sorts of different issues and problems and needs and wants and desires and egos.  And it's a lot going on, man. And the more that you can mitigate your own stress levels, the more that you can calm the demons inside you, the better you're going to interact with people, the better they're going to feel about their interactions with you, the better they're going to interact with other people. There's a ripple effect and it just it makes the whole world better. Like, if you're a better person, if you if you do your best and you get better at it and you keep doing your best, you keep getting better at it.  Like all things in life, you do better at creating a healthy environment for all the people around you.  To you say it that way. It's like if everybody in America exercised, you know, 20 minutes a day, 30. Right. They'd be a better would be a better world.  Hundred percent right. 100 percent get along a little better. Yeah. I don't think there's any denying that. I mean for some people would more. Yeah.  Well my good worked out 20 minutes. Dave's still a dick. That's the outlier. But if you looked at the mean, if you looked at overall, like if you you got three hundred and thirty million people, whatever we've got gotten this country and all of them worked out 20 minutes a day. And then you looked at like what the results were two, three years down the road. I would imagine you would have less aggressive behavior. You would have probably.  Less violent crime. You probably have less arguments. People could be more peaceful about things. You probably have people that were healthier. They'd have less visits to the doctor. They'd have less medical problems. I bet there would be overall a host of benefits that we would achieve nationwide if we could convince people. And I'm not talking about taking a fucking brutal Crossfade class or going to jujitsu and getting strangled every day. I'm talking about going on a hike and doing some push ups, sit ups, some body weight squats.  Very basic, basic stuff, the basics.  I've met enough as you have. I've met enough call killers from martial arts where they're very humble, very nice, and me not coming from that background. I'm shocked. Right. I, I'm expecting a pitbull, but I've got a golden retriever and I think it's because they work out every day and they've been humbled and they do hard work. Yes. So it takes the edge off.  Yeah. It's also they don't have a need to prove themselves. They know what they can do and they don't. They're not trying to puff their chest out and intimidate everyone around them. They're friendly like most that like jujitsu is a perfect example of that because jujitsu. There's only one way to excel at jujitsu. You have to spar so you can't pretend you have to be in there getting strangled or strangling people every day because that's you get humble happens. I mean, I don't know how many times I've tapped out, but it's a lot.  It's thousands.  And you've got to make that decision at that moment. It's gonna happen especially like if you want to get a black belt, you started a white belt. I mean, you're gonna get fucked up. I mean, this is no way around it.  But there's there's great lessons in learning. There's like you start like you. You get your blue belt.  Like, I'm getting really good at this and you roll with some purple belt smashes, you know, like, fuck, I'm terrible. And then you get you probably you're like, I'm doing pretty good. Some brown belt fucking squashes, you know, like, fuck. Like, there's there's you know, it's just like you try to always being low level, right.  Yeah. I like. And then there's there's always room to grow and learn. He don't want to be the master. You want to be the guy who's seeking to improve because there is no real I mean there are masters, there's guys that are at such a high level that unless they run into another master, they're gonna they're gonna do the squashing. But then they've trained with those other masters. They trained with each other all the time. And, you know, it's it's beautiful to watch, you know, like really high level guys tap each other out and you realize, like, this never ends.  It's never, ever run. Yeah. Halcón Gracy has a very famous description of jujitsu. Jujitsu is like I do this to you. You respond. I respond to your response. That goes on forever. Forever. That's jujitsu. I like that. I attack you defend I attack you defend rever forever. That's jujitsu.  I like that. Given that you're present and again, couldn't couldn't we do what Israel does.  Couldn't we have one year. Doesn't have to be military song about it. Yeah. Right.  Yeah. One where I did and it took everybody's ass for one year song about idea.  The problem with that is again the freedom thing. You want people to be able to do whatever they want, but you also get a lot of service out of your country. Right. You get a lot there's a lot that we all benefit from, from having a fire department and a military and clean streets and sanitation and all the different. The fire department takes care of everybody's fire, right. To police. You call nine one one. Theoretically, they show up to help you.  That's something we all pay for. We all this is something that brings us together as a society. And what what separates Israel? I think, first of all, Israel is surrounded by people that they're in conflict with. So they feel like they have to have that. But the fact that they have this mandatory military service, they're very proud people. And there's a a lot of patriotism when it comes to Israel. Some would say that's bad. Some some people say that's bad.  Some people would say that's good. I think there's real benefit to some form of service. I don't know if it has to be military service.  I know what it has to be like, the bonding that yeah, it probably occurs the same thing with our vets. But but, um, every culture has had a rite of passage.  We don't like doing it with these children on it like we need it.  Yes. I think human beings do need a rite of passage. I think that is important. And, you know, these these traditional cultures that have had these rites of passage, that's to signify that someone is coming of age. This is an adult. Now, you've gone through this process and this is a like a belt ceremony. Eliška, you get your black belt, man, they tie that around your waist. Like that is a moment that you'll never forget.  You graduated. Yeah, you graduated. You made it. And I think as an adult, like sometimes people have to know I am an adult now I'm held to a different standard. I need to hold myself to a different standard. I can't just fucking be a ne'er do well and and fucking skip my way through this life and live off of unemployment and fuck people over and scam my way through life. No, I'm I want to be noble.  I want to be respectable. I want to be someone who I respect I. A. Yeah. You want to respect yourself. You want to appreciate yourself, you know? And I think that it's hard to do that. It's easy to do nothing, but it's hard to do nothing, because if you do nothing and live a hard life, it's going to be a sucky life. You don't realize it. But everybody pays. You pay. No matter what.  Either you pay now or you pay with regret. You pay with a lack of success. You pay with a sloppy body and a fuckin weak mind that falls apart at any challenge. You don't have any structure. You know, even know rigidity to your thoughts. You don't have any resolve in your mindset because you've never been tested. And a person who goes through life without ever been tested is a sad person. The saddest thing is seeing a person who's never been tested when the shit hits the fan.  And that's one of the things we're seeing from kov it. We're seeing a lot of people that are just have weak minds and they're just panicking and screaming at people wear a mask. People on the other side of the street.  And then, you know, because they never face tough times.  No, they don't know. They don't know how to buckle up. They don't know how to strap in. They don't know how to overcome, you know. And so this heightened stress level that comes with the pandemic is freaking them the fuck out. And that's one of the reasons why social media is such a fucking shithole right now. It's so bad. So many of those people's shut ins. Some of those people are shut ins have never been challenged.  They don't really know who they are. You know, we're saying like, when you do a race, maybe meet yourself.  These people never met themselves. Now I know all they're doing is judging other people, constantly bitching and bickering about other people. You learn a lot from someone about how much attention they spend on other people's failures. How much time they spend pointing out other people's failures and how little time they spend reflecting on their own.  Yeah. Now that's what we think about our business. We say we shine a mirror in your face, right? Yeah. You get to find out. By the way, anybody could be good when times are good. Yes.  Yes. Yeah.  I mean, that's what I like about physical pursuits, man. You find out who the fuck you are, you know, and you find out whether or not you're that person who can keep going. Well, you're that person who is consistent. So many people who start off like, I'm gonna run a mile a day and they run a mile a day for a couple weeks and they fuck off. You know, it's consistency.  This showing up when you don't wanna show up, forcing yourself to do things you don't want to, but then reaping the rewards and learning. Like if you just worked out every time you felt motivated, you're not going to ever really get in shape.  No. You're not going. No. It's got to be discipline. You got to have discipline. And motivation is great.  I love it. I love music.  I love watching David Goggins clip online or Cam Haines or or Jocko Willink or enemies. Savages. There's so many people out there. You can you could watch one of their videos where they tell you what to do and you just get fired up and you want to go do it. But that's not always gonna be there. You know, sometimes you've got to just you've got to dissect the box is what I'm doing every day. Yeah. You keep Razor-sharp doing it.  This is what I do is what I do. Now, I agree. I agree with that.  I, I love the fact you're spreading it. That's what I love. I love the fact that you're forcing these kids to do these things and then you're putting together these races where it gives people a destination that gives people an opportunity to train for an event. And that's big man advancer, big for us.  And you'll appreciate this one. This is for most people. I mean, we get pre colvard one point six million people a year doing these events, OK? It's a big number. And this is the biggest thing they've ever done. This is their belt ceremony, right? Right. This is the Olympics. They just became a Navy SEAL. Right. Right, right.  And and all the benefits, you talk up like you can't even believe the transformations that happen to all these people in the letters I get. And like, I get paid in that currency. Right. Like, you changed my life.  I'm back at my husband back. My wife, I lost weight. I gave up drugs. I got a thought.  What if you put together like an online thing where the people are accountable? But because of Colvard you like you tell them that event is going to happen. The event is going to take place in six weeks. And this is what you need to do. And then you need to mark your time and every day. Maybe, yeah, maybe you have an app or maybe even simpler. They just use a fucking timer on their phone, you know, and say, OK, you know, ready, set, start, start your timer.  And then you have to complete all these things. And maybe you have a checklist on your Web site where they can check off all the different things that they have to do during that day and get it done. And maybe someone like that 600 pound dude takes him seven hours. The average person takes him 90 minutes, but everybody does it together. And then as a community, they all reported put it up on Instagram with hashtags ranking.  Yeah, I like it. Yeah. It gives someone up, give these people an event without having a physical look. I mean, look, it's probably nothing better than that physical location when you all get together and know the camaraderie and the energy of all the people together running together.  And it's not the same. We did it. We did a very big virtual event. What you're saying we register three point nine. Million people in his. But I don't know how many did. You're only making it right. And then and then what I like what you just said was I didn't have the lead up every day to do 100 push ups. I like I like that part. Yeah. That's the part that excites me. Yeah, right.  But a virtual event, you could kind of get away with cheating, like in the sense that you cheat yourself. You and I know that. Yeah.  I tell them that to just let them know. No.  But if you and I if we were signed up for September 1st, we're going to do a Spartan. We're gonna.  We got to show up. And you don't want to be embarrassed. I don't want to be embarrassed. But with the virtual you could kind of hide behind your couch. Yeah. Right. So that means you might not do the pushups. But I like I still like the idea because maybe fifty thousand people every day I'll do it.  It's something and it'll do, it'll have an effect. I agree that it won't have as big an effect as if you're doing it live. I think the way you do it live is awesome. And that's that's the best effect. But, you know, you got to do what you gotta do in times change.  Yeah. They'll come back. Yeah. Right. I mean, hopefully I never thought this was gonna happen.  And what's the story moving matter here? When do you leave? Soon. Taxes are. Yeah.  When I go to Texas, I got a farm in Vermont. It's a little cold out cold. I just want to go somewhere in the center of the country somewhere. It's easier to travel to both places and somewhere we have a little bit more freedom. Also, I think that where we live right here in Los Angeles is overcrowded. And I think most of the time it's not a problem. But I think it's exposing the fact that it's a real issue when you look at the number of pieces of people that are catching covered because of this overpopulation issue.  When you look at the traffic, when you look at the economic despair, when you look at the homelessness problem that's accelerated radically over the last six, seven, 10 years. I think there's too many people here. I think it's not tenable. And don't I don't think it's manageable. And I think every mayor does a shit job of doing it because I don't think anybody could do a great job of it. I think there's certain things you're going to have to deal with when you have a population of whatever the fuck L.A. is like 20 million plus people.  Too many people. It's too many people. Yeah, that's what I think. I think where you're living is probably the perfect way to do it. 500 people. That's nice.  But then you got those dudes yelling at you. Where's the deer? You just the language.  I could go on. We could do a hours of the negatives of a small town.  Oh, yeah, there's negatives. Everybody knows your business.  Yeah. Everyone knows what you're doing. Where are you going? You know, there's pros and cons to everything. But I think I think you have a better opportunity at more pros when there's less folks.  I agree. So, so small town Texas or let's leave it at that. I got ideas. Jamie's coming. Nice. We got them so excited. It doesn't affect the business.  No, we're just gonna do it from there. That's the other thing is Texas has comedy. They have standup comedy. I've been doing. I did. Well, I haven't been doing. But I did one weekend in Texas while this was going on. It was the first weekend I was able to do standup.  But then my friends were in San Antonio and they got covered down there. But those knuckleheads were out there talking to people and shaking hands and taking pictures and stuff and.  Texas would be the last stand place to ever wear a mask or not shake a hand.  They wear masks, though. People are wearing masks. Last time I was there, I think now they're woken up right now. This is a weird disease, man. It's weird, you know. It's super. But now, again, I was talking to a neuroscientist yesterday, was saying the latest is they don't think a set symptomatic or asymptomatic people are contagious. And I'm like, well, what the fuck, man? I thought they were. I thought, that's part of the problem.  Now, they don't ever get something else. They don't know. There's they don't know. They don't know if you can catch it twice. They don't know. I heard that's coming out. They think you can. Then they say it's very unlike anybody's are gone away.  They don't know. They don't know.  You prefer stand up over this. I'd like all the things I do. Yeah. Yeah, I mean, very scary getting up on stage. It's exciting. It's not scary. Not anymore. The first time we did it was scary. You know, after you develop a certain amount of proficiency, you know, what's scary or what's nerve racking is when you release a special, I go do a Netflix special. And then I have. A whole new hour after, right?  It's all new material, that's all, because everybody's seen it. Yes, and I know that's scary because then you go on stage, all these people pay to see you. They're all excited. They think you're hilarious and you've got nothing. So you have to write a lot and you have to work it out. But just exciting. It's more exciting. I prefer the word exciting. It's a society.  It's challenging a show like Netflix when you do that for an hour. How how many pages of material is that?  Well, it takes about two years. It takes a writer. Yeah. It takes really a year to write it and then a year to polish it and then add new stuff to it and really figure out where it is.  But, you know. Each bit as many, many pages depends, you know, it really depends on the bit, it depends on, you know, how how I mean, a lot of it gets chop. I mean, maybe I'll start out with like 10 pages and then I chop it down to one and then the actual bit becomes one page. But how many pages did it take to get correct the bit or to read, edit and try it again?  A second draft. A third draft.  And are you tested in front of people as you. I have to. You have to. Yeah. Santa, you have to test in front of a live audience. You write sometimes I write bits and they are finished before they ever get to the stage and they're done like the moment I bring them to this day's already done. But that's rare. Most of the time I have an idea and I think I know how it's gonna work. And then I say it, but it doesn't work that good or I have a new way to do it that's better.  Or come up with a new tag line that changes the bit. It's like it's a weird art form because you have to kind of do it in front of people.  So there's a lot of people that are trying to do it. Like on Zoome, they're trying to do Zoome standup, but it's terrible. Yeah, yeah. It's Santa. You have to do live. It's like Zoome workout.  Not the same as now, but it's something, something. It's something people. Yeah. Yeah. People move in. Yeah. Yeah. Make it make America fit again. Yeah.  So this is you have all these other different things you like to do. You think, you think you do too many different things. What are you thinking about pulling the trigger on.  What am I adding or taking. What are you adding.  I love this kids. They, I mean if you if you know that's why I asked you about standup comedy versus the podcast or anything you do if you put a gun to my head or knife like you did earlier when you tested me, I, I like the kids.  The kids are like wet clay in the sense that you really feel like you make an impact.  I make fun. I can make an impact. I've been getting. We didn't talk about this. I've been getting some 21 or 22 year olds from very, very wealthy families that are saying, hey, Joe, they know me through somebody, whatever. My kids are a little they need some help. I want to put them on the farm with you. They're hard to fix the time.  You're 21, 22. They're hard to fix these these little kids. I make a big impact.  I mean, the letters I got are Tear-jerker is after after the after the tax, I saw them writing the parents about how terrible I was, you know, and then seeing 14 days later, like the impact.  Yeah. I want I want more. Yeah. You know, no, I think you're dead right about that.  If you can give a kid a like a transformational experience when they're when they're young, some that really sticks with us the rest of their life.  Right. Yeah. And the other thing I like about it is they can't really quit. Right. You know, if the parent gets involved and it's all fucked up, but if the parent stays out of it, we're doing a mate. I got a name. I'm doing another one right now.  I'm sitting here. I got another I got another 20 kids there right now.  And they're in Vermont. Vermont right now is running the cracking the whip. And they, the Olympian mount more for a guy, Eric Ashley. And they're kicking these kids asses.  And they run in this every two weeks with new group.  New group. I mean, it's selfish for me because I want Mike I want my kids to keep just reading. Listening. Right. Right. And so I need more kids for them. And so I just set up another group and some of the old kids came. So this is their second tour, we'll call it. Yeah. Which is great. One of them's an 11 year old girl that's just bad ass stoic. And. And one of the older boys I found out last night when I got to California is hitting his dad up and saying, you've got to get me out of here.  You've got to lie to Joe and tell me, have a family vacation. Get me the fuck out of here. And Daniel's oldest fifteen.  And the dad hit me up and I said, listen, next time he talks to you, tell him we have an eleven year old girl by his side that is finishing this thing. Are you kidding me? So you can't blame them because they've never tested themselves and never done hard things. Right. But I love it.  How are you structuring this? Do you sit out in advance and decide what they're gonna do? I go every day.  So Andy Andy, the Olympic wrestler, when he. 2008 Olympian, didn't medal, went to Russia and he spent a couple of years in Russia to learn their system. Why did the Russians get all these gold medals in wrestling? And they climb mountains and they climb ropes and they just fucking work hard and not the American wrestlers don't. And so we took a bunch of that Russian system. We took a bunch of the mountain warfare stuff, and then we just added the Spartans sprinkles in there.  And the stuff my mom, the Spartans sprinkled sprinkles. And so, you know, they're waking up early, they're hiking the mountain, they're doing miserable shit, carrying rocks, always purposeful. So we're building we're building stuff out of rocks. So be there for the test of time. And so they have they come back and see the efforts of their work.  And cold water is always involved because as you said, with a shower, cold water sucks. They drink only water as well.  They drink only water. All the Doritos, all that stuff is gone. It's only three meals a day. It's healthy food, probably keeping a little bit hungry because, you know, a lion is most handsome when it's hungry. We're not true. Yeah, I mean, it wants food. I've never heard that as handsome one that hungry. I mean, you're right.  It's ready to attack. Yeah. And so. So. Yeah. And bed early. We are issuing phones for 30 minutes. They get to text or call their parents or whatever.  And the minutes we're doing two days on this particular campus, much more wrestling focused. So two days on. And then one day to do a big hike. So they did a giant hike today.  So they do wrestling. Yeah. This this even the first camp, I didn't say to you we had a fight club every day.  So they were some of them were wrestlers, some warrant. There were girls in there, never done it before. And we created like a Brad Pitt fight club down the basement with Andy. And it was awesome. The kids fucking love that part of the camp every day. They loved it.  So they beat each other up and be teacher. I was wrestling. So it was just wrestling. He set the rules. It was like, hey, I just want to get a high single leg. This is what it is, right?  There were games like that. OK.  They loved it. They'd pound the mat. They'd be screaming for an opponent. It was it's almost instinctual or something. It was unbelievable.  That's great to keep them from their phones for that long, too. Yeah. Was it was. Yeah, it was great. So that's great.  If anybody wants to get a hold you and wanted to do that, how would they enlist their kid. It's always a bunch of people listening and looking at their fat kid laying on the couch right now. Gone. Bobby, I've got something for you.  Yeah. So I give the whole world my email address. The only thing I ask is don't write me more than two sentences.  Hold on a second.
