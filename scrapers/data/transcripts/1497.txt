He currently fights M.A for Bellator and he has right now a very controversial Instagram page because he's posts every video he can find of police brutality and some people are mad at him and some people want to celebrate that. Some people think it's bad. I think it's good. I think it's good even for cops. I think the good cops need to see that kind of shit and the bad cops need to know that people are watching. This is going to cause some controversy, this podcast, I'm sure.  But, you know, he's just showing. Please welcome the great and powerful stitch them up.  Joe Shillong girlfriend podcast about the Joe Rogan Experience Train by day.  Joe Rogan podcast. My Night All Day did them up. What's up, brother? We're going. We're Roland.  Roland. So I've been talking about you a lot lately. I appreciate that.  You know, I love you, but it's also your Instagram page has become a highlight of police brutality. And I know you take a lot of shit for it, but I think it's very important. And we were just talking about this. I think it's important not just for the people, but I think it's important for the police. I think it's important for police reform. I think they need to see like this is this is what happens when you have shitty people doing this very fucking difficult job and you got a lot of them.  Mm hmm.  I think, you know, my thing was it just became everybody just always says was only a few bad apples, a few bad apples. A few bad apples, and I'm like, well, I can just show you there's a lot of these bad apples, you know what I mean? And I think that, like you said, it's better for future police, but if they're so scared to do their job, it's because everyone hates them, because everybody hates them, because they're constantly being dickheads to everybody.  That makes it worse for the good cops. You know what I mean?  I do know what you mean. When I was talking about this the other day with calling on noir and we were saying that it's a job that is almost impossible to do.  For the average person, you need to be like a fucking Navy SEAL, you need to be like a person who's gone through some rigorous training and a person who really understands how to defuse situations. You need to be a person who knows how to keep your shit together, a person who knows how to respect people. They need a lot more training. Joko Willink was talking about that. He said, I think they should have 20 percent training because they trained for, like, you know, a couple of weeks, like nine weeks or so, and then it's over.  And then they're out there in the field. He goes, I think 20 percent of their time should be spent training.  I don't mean to interrupt you. Maybe it's even worse than that is it's not nine weeks. And then the field in L.A. County, you want to be a sheriff. It's nine weeks or however long and it's ten weeks. I'm sorry, 12 weeks. It's not that many weeks right out of the academy. You go straight to two years in and the jail there, like all those other human interaction you've had before you went to the academy. Now we're going to surrounded by the worst examples of everybody for two years, and then you're going to go on the streets and try to be normal.  You go to jails for two year minimum. What of all sheriffs? That's probably because they just need people in the jails, right?  Well, that goes back to what I mean, I feel like the. We got to there's a lot of stuff going on there. There's a lot of shit going on there. First of all, there's private prisons, then there's drug laws. That's that's those are the two big ones. You want to find out why the fucking prisons are filled up with people. Those are two big ones right there. How many people are in jail for shit? They should never be in jail for decisions that other people make with their own body.  That doesn't harm anybody other than themselves. You could buy alcohol, but you can't buy coke. You can't buy weed. You can't buy nonviolent drug offenses is a giant percentage of the population.  And then you say like they go to jail for that because they made a mistake. But then they don't just get out of jail and they're free. They put you on probation and they put these extended five years probation. Anything's a probation violation. And then they just keep you back into that same system, back to the same system, back to the same system.  You know, Father's Day, I was I was out back.  I did like a poster on my kids. And, you know, I'm really proud of my kids. So I did a post on Father's Day and I was like, man, it's Father's Day when I smoke a joint fucking crack a beer. It's like ten o'clock in the morning. I can do that on Father's Day, you know, and sitting there all joy. And I'm like, I want to do a post for Ignite shot to ignite. And I'm like, it hit me like it's Father's Day.  How many fathers are in prison right now still to this day over something I can do legally and post on the Instagram. Now, it's insane.  Not only that, it's insane in jail for something that's now an essential, like an essential thing that you can do during covid like when everything was locked down, you could still buy weed nuts. It's crazy.  And then you can't just blindly turn your they turn your eyes to all this stuff. No. Everything going on in the world. It's like that's why I'm putting this stuff on on my Instagram. It needs to be seen.  Yeah, it's I'm glad you're doing it, you know, and I know you take a lot of heat for it. And that's one of the reasons why I highlighted it. I want to shine people your way and let them know like you're doing. You're not doing this because you're a dickhead. You're doing it because you're showing horrible shit. There's a video that you show that I've watched so many times, man, that the cop that reneged chokes that lady and throws her to the ground for no reason.  Horrendous, no reason. Horrendous. I mean, you would see him some days. I mean, sometimes I don't have time. And I'm going to look at the comments because I don't want to go there. But some days like today, I got time. I will battle these fucking assholes in the comments all day long. They'll defend that.  Well, she shouldn't have resisted. I want I want context. Show me context. But that was your mom. What scenario or context are you looking for? That that would be OK. Or you want to jump on your back or your daughter or your grandma. Yeah. Jesus Christ, it's not. It's not. It's people that shouldn't be cops. And it's too easy to be a cop. It's too easy. And they don't get paid enough, you know, they don't get trained well enough.  And this defunding the police shit is the wrong way to handle it. I know they think it's the right way to handle it. Yeah, we're just these cops are bad. We just take away all the money. Oh, my God. You're going to create fucking chaos. I don't know.  I haven't looked into the defunding thing a lot. I've heard it. I heard about it a lot. But when you talk about defunding, let's talk about why do why do these cops need fucking tanks in downtown? Why do these cops need all these AR 15s and full bullet? Like, what is all what are we training for?  We're trying to scare people.  Why are we spending all of these tax dollars to scare people and show you some shit that John Joseph sent me, my buddy John Joseph from the Chromatics.  He's this is this shows that people who have different points of view could be good friends because he's a good friend of mine. He wrote a book called Is for Pussies. So there you go, folks. We can all get along. We really can, you fucking idiots.  But anyway, he he sent me some shit.  His friend is he's working homicide in Harlem. And 21 people got shot the other day because nobody wants to be a cop there anymore. So it's fucking madness. Like he said, it is madness in New York City. Like, literally, goddamn it, where can I find it? Like, nobody wants to do the fucking job. He's like, it's crazy down there.  They didn't want to do the job before or they don't want to do the job. Now that the heat in the spotlight is on the ball, everybody's resigning. Will they can't. If I can't do whatever I want to have absolute immunity, then I want the job anymore. You shouldn't have the fucking job to begin with. That's a good point, too. You know what I mean? Like, why did you have the job? All right, look at this.  This is all the fucking people that got shot the other night as one day.  This is what's that's what happens when there's no cops, when there's no cops and no one's policing anything, people just go ham. I mean, that's what you saw in Santa Monica. Santa Monica is as white as Wonder Bread, right? Yeah. And it was crazy during the looting. I mean, crazy. The cops were told to stand down. They were told to stand around and watch. So the whole thing of, you know, hey, you need the cops when you call him, you need him when shit goes crazy, the cops are there for you.  Not that time. The sheriff actually told them to not do anything. So people were smashing windows and stealing things. And they're standing around and there's there's videos of this one guy running around the street pointing guns at people, cars smashing into each other. It's like a movie.  What was the point of telling them to stand down? I think they thought that people were going to burn all this anger out, the George Floyd anger and that somehow or another, like, let them do it and then we'll clean up the mess. It's just incompetent policing. It's incompetent leadership.  So does the person that made that choice, do we vote for him? Because everybody thought that for her, like this is the kind of decisions that need to be made. And you have to ask yourself, why would the what was the purpose in telling them that?  Well, this is a liberal, progressive perspective. This is something that they've tried in a bunch of different cities. They also de Blasio did the same thing in New York City. Cops were literally told to stand down. And the cops are standing there and they're doing nothing. Why? People are just fucking videos, the videos from New York City, the nuttiest because people are filming them from their apartments. So they're looking down on the street while cars are running, people over and people are smashing into windows and running in and steal and stuff like all these kids just want free shit.  Nothing to do with black lives for the most part, a lot of them or just opportunists looking for stealing and then also caught up in the chaos of the smashing windows and stealing stuff. And then the cops aren't doing anything and they're young and they've been out of work for three fucking months and everybody's broke. It's just so many factors compounded together. But Giuliani was actually on Fox News talking about there's a particular like political perspective on how to deal with looting and riots in these particular situations.  And the idea is to let it burn out, let these people burn it out of their system, but that it doesn't work. He's like this is an outdated style of of policing that they've figured out doesn't work in like the 60s and 70s. But there's a lot of progressive people that are in positions of leadership that still think it's a good idea.  It seems like a terrible idea.  Well, nobody knows really what the fuck to do. And everything goes haywire. It's like theories like what's the theme? Like, what do you do? Well, you better protect lives, but don't worry about property because everything's gone nuts. And then the other perspective is sent in. The fucking National Guard never is like, don't do that. That's the military. So I don't know what the correct perspective is and thank God I'm not a fucking governor or mayor.  That's when, you know, things are fucked. Someone like me ever gets to a position like that.  Yeah, I don't know. A part of me thinks that the National Guard would be service, you know, off duty servicemen or however that works that are from this city or from the area would probably do a lot better job and get more respect than the police that are driving around shooting kids with pepper balls and doing all this crazy shit we're seeing everywhere.  You would say that. But one of the most egregious videos of police brutality was the National Guard in Minnesota, where those girls were on their porch.  And if you saw that one and there was these National Guard dickheads are walking down the street to get inside, get inside they go light them up and they're shooting rubber bullets at these fucking girls in their house. They're on their porch since these girls got hit. It's insane. And she's like, oh, fuck. And she's like inside her house. And then a bunch of people have lost eyes. There's a bunch of people who lost Istar in this.  There's so many and everyone now everyone's just tagging me in videos and see overwhelming that kid that got shot in the face. The other one lost his eyes.  Multiple people have lost their eye. Journalists have lost their eyes.  The video I posted of that guy there, like all squared up, like a he's like walking tours and talking shit or is smoking a cigarette and they maysam in the face and he turns around like a fucking G like hits the cigarette. Like what a dick turns back and they shoot him in the face point blank with like a I think it's a tear gas canister.  Yeah.  To the face. In the face. I saw it. I mean it explodes in his face. Yeah. Who knows what happened to that guy, you know. But it's Yeah. That is not serving or protecting.  It's neither of those things on any level. On any level. And you know, I get it man. Look, there's a fucking video we want to talk about the other perspective. Does a video go to Hector Lombards, Instagram? There's a video. I mean, this is where it gets really squirrelly because this is dumb white guy who's in the face of this black cop, the black cops not doing anything. He's doing his job. And this guy is calling him a bitch.  He's calling them all these terrible names. He's inches from this scrawny ass man bun wearing dickhead is in this cop's face like what happened to Black Lives Matter. Like if this is Black Lives Matter, this is a black guy. Like, what are you doing? He's not even doing anything, man. He's standing there trying to keep the peace and you're fucking with him and inciting him. It's people, man. It's people. People. There's a lot of us.  And in pressure situations, a lot of us suck. And and these cops that you're seeing that are doing these horrible things, they're just fucking people, man.  And if you give a person that insane power to mace a guy in the face, then shoot him in the head with a fucking tear gas canister, that guy's going to be held accountable. And you got to make sure that never fucking happens again. And that video should be used for training purposes.  But everybody else on that that day, they say there's good cops. Everybody else on that guy's team knows that guy. You know what I mean? They know that you're in a locker room with all your buddies or whatever, you know, who cheats on his wife and who doesn't like, you know, the guy. You know, that guy's a fucking asshole, you know what I mean?  Right. So but what do you do? It's just like I mean, I look at it, they feel like they can't do anything because those people protect them. If they're in the middle of a fucking shootout, they don't want to be the guy that doesn't get back up because you ratted out the guy that shot the guy with the tear canister.  Well, if that's the problem that we're facing, then it's time to clear and clean house and start all over again. And everybody needs to be you're all fired. And then you can reapply for your job, but you're going to reapply for your job from a completely different system or a different interview process. Somebody that's not attached to you, because if that's the problem that you have is now I can't trust these guys, I'm going to trust me. Then what are we supposed to do?  Just say it's OK every time that happens?  Yeah, we shouldn't we definitely shouldn't say it's OK. They need reform. There's no question about it. Anybody who says they don't need reform needs to go to the Joe Schelling's Instagram page.  And for real, that the other one, that fucking old man that gets pushed, pushed down and cracks his fucking head. And then those guys in solidarity quit and walk off the job.  And then when the guys get released from whatever cops got charged or released from whatever, they're all the other cops are outside plussing them. Yeah.  You can't push an old guy to the ground. And he cracked his head open and you walk away. I don't know what that old guy said to them. I mean, he was apparently an old hippie that's like been a peace activist forever. And, you know, he's like eighty something years old or something like that. He's really old man, like seventy something years old. Do you remember seventy five. When he gets pushed back and you could see his feeble he falls, he has no control over his body and bangs his fucking head off the concrete and they just leave him there man.  They just leave him there. No one's doing CPR, no one's calling a medic, no one's checking him. No one's holding his hand and always doing a goddamn thing like you. Just watch an assault. You watch an assault on an old man, on a helpless old man.  Yeah. A helpless woman or a helpless thirteen year old girl. You're slamming around like it's all.  Yes. Weak, weak, weak, weak, weak men that are doing this.  Yes, yes, yes. And these are the ones that we give. I don't know. It's like this lack of masculinity. So we were like scared. So we give somebody else the power. And you're giving weak minded people guns and power.  Right. You know, giving people guns and power that the psychological ramifications of that job must be crazy. If you're day in, day out seeing gun shots and fucking suicides and car accidents and stabbings and rape and all day long you're seeing the worst aspects of humanity that your mind gets fucked. I've talked to a lot of cops that are good guys and they'll tell you like the job is hard, man. There's days where you literally you would you think about taking your own life so you don't have to see anything anymore.  They say that I've heard that from cops. And these are not cops that are abusive. They're cops that are just like, man, I'm telling you, it's like you get overwhelmed. Like you can only walk up on so many suicides, so many shotgun wounds to the face. You can only walk up on so many of those and keep your sanity. And, you know, the other thing that JoCo Willink was saying was that it's it's the same thing in the teams.  Like psychologically, some people can handle anything and some people cannot handle anything. Some people just one or two things, and they're off till they just can't know for sure. And but some people, they can go back home to the family and be a good dad and be a good husband and be a good neighbor and be a good person and just just absorb it and just, you know, go, well, you know, it's horrible. But, hey, that's life.  It's tough then that's another area that needs to be reformed, is mental health with borders or whatever, but we can't just ignore the whole the whole thing and say, well, you know, that's a tough job.  No, we can't. That's like the Chris Rock thing about like you can't be a a sometimes a good pilot, really a pilot. You can't just crash into things you can't go without. Can't be that ability, you know, which off topic.  But like that's how I feel about judges.  Like how many fights can you screw up before there's an accountability. Yes. Yes. You know what I mean. Yeah. No, that's a real good point.  Yeah. I mean, it's like basically every job, you know, it's just some jobs have much higher consequences. And cops, it's like the highest it's one of the highest cops. Soldiers is a few with the highest consequences of your mistakes, you know, and zero accountability.  Very little they do cops don't get don't go to regular court. They get the internal investigations. They don't protect their own. They protect each other through their own little team.  That woman, what is their name? Briana Taylor. Is that her name?  The woman who got shot in her home and then they no knock warrant kicked down the wrong door, shut the window she was playing with, whether it's son or little brother, somebody on the in the bed of the video game. And then they charged her boyfriend or husband with attempted murder for shooting back at the person who's shooting through the window. Didn't even tell them they were cops. And he's sane.  I mean, they have this guy cuffed in a fucking jumpsuit going to jail. It's crazy.  It's and the cop who did that only got fired. That's it.  There was another one where the guy got and just now, just now got fired, by the way, that that happened quite a while ago, the one I posted of the guy in the hotel where they called the get a pellet gun because he was out of town, exterminator and with his girlfriend in a hotel room. And they call the cops. The cops come and they're like lined up down the hall with an AR15 screaming and ridiculous orders.  Yes, Crocodylus, we're all over here, hands behind your back crawl while you have stretch your head in your temple. But don't fucking move or I'll kill you.  Don't reach back. The guy kept losing his pants because he's never belt on. He's crying. It's like, please, please. And they just fuckin gun him down while he's belly down.  So they already knew what they wanted to do and they're waiting for him to give the reason. Well, it's not hard to tell. That guy is not a threat, just like it's not hard to tell that that woman, like the one with a they throw the woman down and she jumps, the cop jumps on her back and puts her in a rear naked choke. What do you do when you argue with your wife at home or your sister or your girlfriend?  Like at what point this year? Where do you get the right to just jump to that conclusion just because you're a cop?  That woman's not a threat to, you know, that old man that I posted yesterday. They body slammed it.  You know, it's just I don't know if you saw the one where was a guy who got pulled over going five miles an hour over the speed limit and the officers threatening to pepper spray him because he's filmon. Oh, yeah. See that one? Yeah. Yeah. There's a lot of a man.  There's a lot of other one of the it's a black guy and he's just going to like losing his shit on the cop. And that's a new one. Right. He's like, yeah, I just thought recently it's like you pulled me over for not using my turn signal and you walked up to my window with a gun. I have a gun pointed at me. Yeah. What the fuck is wrong with you?  Yeah, I got kids. I got a wife. I want to live my life. Why the. Because yeah. Because I made a turn. A turn signal. Right. Why are these guys so terrified to do their job. Well, you don't know what it's like to work the streets of South Side of Chicago. There's people that live in south side of Chicago. There's people that grow up there, people that are raised there. There's old ladies to walk down the street there, you know what I mean?  So don't tell me because you're too terrified to do your job. It makes it OK for you to kill people.  Well, it's definitely not OK to behave like that because they escalate way before it becomes a real there's nothing going on. You're pulling a guy over. It's one thing if you're pulling a guy over in, his windows are all blacked out and he won't he's not complying. He's not rolling down his window.  You should get sketched out and you run his tag and he has fifteen armed robbery charges around that. You're right.  It's but then, you know, it's just there needs to be solutions. All this complaining about it is great. It's good. I really think what you're doing is very good because I think the cops should think it, too. They really should, man, because it should highlight the need for reform and highlight the need for education and highlight the need for better training and better funding. You want better people, you've got to pay them. You've got to you can't have billboards up that, say, earn 50000 dollars a year, have a great gig.  You know, that's not the people you want, man. You want you want it to be difficult to be a cop.  It sounds like a joke, but it's not a joke. You need more training time to become a barber than it is to become a cop. That's a fact. That's not a joke. It sounds like a joke. It's not a joke. It's a fucking fact. We give these people that have like very little training whatsoever and very little, very little background on their mental stability, you know, fucking weirdo when you meet them. Joe, you look like I was a little off.  You're not going to give that guy a fucking gun and a badge and then the right to do whatever he wants. And that's what we do. And it keeps biting us in the ass all the time.  Yeah, I have a buddy of mine and he has this dude who was his trainer. They kept trying to be a cop. The guy was fucking insane. Fucking insane. He would tell him in the middle of training.  Jesus doesn't want you doing that right now. Jesus wants you doing something different, maybe like what he's like, Jesus wants you doing squats today. Just got to trust in the Lord man. Today it squats. He's like, what the fuck are you saying? He's like, he was wrong. Like, something's off in his head. Right? And he just kept saying that, yeah, Longbeach turned me down. So, you know, I'm going to try for the Pasadena Police Department.  Like, this guy was mentally unstable and he kept trying to become a cop.  Now, if one police department was light on people and they needed that guy and they gave that guy a gun and let the guy pull people over and Jesus tells them to shoot somebody, Florida saying that they would take on the police department, reports that we would take all the police officers at the state.  They got in trouble or whatever. Whatever the that thing was, L.A., all the police officers are not responding.  There's people they applied to be in the military and didn't pass the thing, but still became cops. It takes let you a lower standard to be a police officer in the US than it is to be a soldier in the US. That's crazy.  What are we doing and what and what is the you know, we have the same process. When I was at high school, the guys come around in their suits. They you know, they if you take the asbestos tests on, we can show you the world. You'll get a free education, all that shit. You don't qualify for them. But I could still get a badge and a gun and people are going to respect me.  Yeah. Yeah, there's a lot of that is a lot of that shit going on. It's real. That's right. I mean, no ifs, ands or buts about it.  And it's just a poor management. It's a poor management decision to to run the police departments that way, to have them that underfunded, to have them that poorly represented. Because I know there's good cops out there. I've met him. I know good guys that are cops. For sure.  For sure. The two cops. Yeah, good cops on my call. It seems like a good guy. And I've seen him met other cops that I'm like, that dude is not all there. Right. That is not all there.  And everybody everybody in that fucking precinct knows all that's that's Dewey. You know, don't worry about Dewey.  He's a good guy.  I just don't get pulled over by I'm still pulled over by him. Yeah. Yeah. It's we're in a crisis in this country in many ways. And JoCo was talking about this, that it's a leadership crisis. It's all from the top down, you know, and it's a leadership when it comes to the president, leadership crisis, governors, mayors, sheriffs and then the cops themselves. It's it's a bunch of people that really don't have the character to be doing that.  And look, it's a I wouldn't wish it on anybody, man. That's a tough fucking get all those gigs. We just being a governor fucking insanely hard. I couldn't imagine being responsible for the economy of a whole state, especially California. That's why our goofy governor keeps calling it a nation state. You might as well be a fucking nation. There's forty million people in this motherfucker. That's a lot of people, man. That's crazy. I don't want that job.  But if you're going to have that job you got, you better be fucking really good, man.  You've got to be really good.  I think that we need four year terms for everybody of major powers like this so that we don't end up with these career politicians career. You know, this just stays the same and you build your relationships and the shit just stays the same. There's no accountability. There's no fresh blood coming in.  Maybe that's a good key for cops to have a four year like term and then you're up for review or the police chief, you know, the police, the police chief.  I can only imagine. That's what I like, like Lethal Weapon or whatever Martin and Riggs walk in or whatever. And he's like, oh, you know, the commissioner, Commissioner Gordon's breathing down my neck. You got to stop choking all these guys out. And they're like, you know, I don't give a fuck, but, you know, the commissioner's on my back. He's not saying, hey, motherfucker, you're fired. I'm a pressed charges on her fucking asses.  Oh, we do things. You know what I mean?  But then there's always the there's the romantic crazy cop like Riggs and Lethal Weapon was the romantic, crazy cop. It was kind of cool.  He's a little unhinged, but he gets the job done. Yeah, right. You know, but those guys are never abusive in those movies. The unhinged guys, they're all heroes. Yeah. They're always heroes and cool with people, but they just, you know, eat cold pizza in the morning in a blender and they fucking smoke cigarettes and then they choke people.  So my son Jackson was scared of the police before I was ever and I said do. When I noticed it, I was aware of it. I like took a step like step back and looked at myself as he's getting this from me.  And he wasn't he was like three or four years old. And we would pull I remember when they we pulled in to the bank and I parked between two cop cars and my older son gets out the car and I'm like, I was Jacks. And he's still in the back. And he's like, oh, like tense in the backseat. Like, what's wrong with you? And he's like, you wouldn't say anything. My older son was like, always scared of the cops.  I'm like, Why? Because all he sees is cops come in, you're in trouble.  Cops, cops take you to jail. Cops do bad things. There's no like when I was a kid and Bellbrook, Ohio, I grew up, we had a cat and he used to always go up in the tree. And my mom. We call the police and the fire department and Tom the cat, when the fucking tree, you know, that's old school shit, right? We try, you know, I could climb to the high, you know, get down, you're going to fall.  And then you call the the fucking police and the fire department and they'd come and they'd be cool and they fucking cop would give us cover crackerjacks. When a cop drove by, he waved at you.  You know, that small town life. Well, that was like how shit should be. Well, it's like if I met a fucking Quizno's and I'm like, oh, man.  Excuse me, officer, what time is it on my fucking lunch break that just fucking dickheads all the time they pull you over.  What are you doing? Speeding to my town? You know, it's just like this overwhelming fuck you all the time. I got the cop stories.  I got I got a couple stories. I've know you do. I got stories. There's a lot of cop stories to have, good and bad, but you only hear the bad ones. There's a there's a lot of interactions every day that people have with cops that are positive, I'm sure.  But it's just exactly like the Chris Rock joke. You really can't have bad apples when it's that job now, just like you can't have bad fire department people. You can't have bad pilots, you can't have it's just a job you got to do. Right.  And then it's like for how long? Like, that's why lately I've been posting videos for like three years ago, four years ago, same same type of shit like this is an old video and nothing's changed. Yeah. Rodney King wasn't that long ago. There was another one just came out. This guy's handcuffed on his back and they're beating him batons, telling him to put his legs down there, beating the shit out of it. Yeah, I've seen it.  And then the guy that got pulled over fell asleep and Wendy's parking lot cop Muslim over security door. And the guy's like, look, man, I was fighting with my wife. Fucking had, you know, he'd been drinking. Yes, sir. I've been drinking. They had he hadn't been driving. They could prove yet. So. Well, could you take his breathalyzer. He's like, well you know, I've already been drinking and he's like it's just part of my investigation.  It's no big deal. The reality was they needed him take the breathalyzer because they could have. Right. Then they could arrest him because they didn't see him actually drive. They couldn't do that. So they trick him into doing that. Then they arrest him. When they arrest him, he's got his hands behind his back. Maybe he's tussling or whatever. Nobody wants to get arrested while they're tasing him in the back multiple times. These idiots give up the Taser.  So he's running away with the Taser and they shoot him in the back.  Yeah, we were talking about that one. He turned what didn't he turn and point the Taser at him or is that what they said? The video?  It looks like he's going to do whatever invest. I can't keep up with investigations of like what things are being found. Maybe there was a shot left in it. That's why there was a pop heard. Are there? I, I don't know. So there might have been a shot left in it.  People are saying that. Yeah, that's what I don't know. OK, I don't believe either way.  But if I take you in the back four times, it doesn't give you the right to kill me. If I shoot or aim one in your general direction, it's ice, this motherfucker.  And it wasn't like that guy was you had a conversation with him. He just said he would go home. He was daughter.  His daughters were at his sister's house. But I'll just leave the car. Here you go. There he had the agenda, what they wanted to do. Why shouldn't that guy just, you know, like, go home?  Marc Lamont Hill had a really important point. It's like, why is that a case? Even for the police? There should be something else, like some other division that just handles nonviolent people that are just in need of assistance. If you got a guy who's drunk in a parking lot, they should just be some people that you want to cite him and give him some sort of a fine or suspend his license for thirty days or something like that, something nonviolent.  But that guy should just get a ride home. And if he says the he drove there, well, hey, man, you can't drive drunk. You're in trouble for that. But but to try to tease him and all that other shit, there's no there's no need for that. See, I'm torn on that.  Is that. Yes, you're absolutely right. Somebody should be able to see that. I just don't think that it's out of the realm of possibilities that the police could be called to that scene and not end up shooting the guy. Yeah, they should have the same wherewithal that you and I are having this conversation.  They call it. What are you doing? Yeah, go. Your wife's popish your dumb drunk right now.  And that's one of the ones where the Atlanta Police Department is all walking off in solidarity because the guy was charged with felony murder. And so they all quit.  Yeah, a lot of them are just not responding to things. They basically don't feel like they're supported and they want to let people know, like this is what we do. This is how hard this job is. So this is what it's like when cops don't respond. That is the most idiotic baby little child shit to do. I can't even get behind that at all. Well, if you don't, I'm taking my ball and I'm going home. Then you don't want me here.  Then I'm leaving.  I don't even know. It's ridiculous. It's not going to change the the the the charges. They charged them with felony murder. They're not going to uncharged him with felony murder because the cops aren't responding at once.  It's like just shows how much they don't care about their community. They don't care about their own. They don't care about protecting and serving for people. They care about staying together.  You know, that's what we're saying earlier. This is that's the oath, right? That's the you know, the code of silence. You you have to protect those other people because the shit could go down. You need them to have your back.  It's it's I'm not saying it's right, but I'm saying that is how it works in the police department. That's terrible. Did you ever see the documentary The Seven Five? I did. You should see it. It's fucking crazy. It's the seven five. The seventy five. It is all about this guy. It's this guy, Mike Dowd, who's out now, who became a corrupt police officer, just joined the force because he wanted to be a cop and then right away was introduced to the fact that this whole fucking thing is bad, it's all corrupt, they're all bad cops, they're all doing fucked up shit.  I'm pretty sure they pushed a guy out of a window like one of the first days that he got there. Someone got killed and they would just say, this is how it works. And then cut to many years later, he's robbing drug dealers, selling drugs and organizing hits on people like it's a crazy fucking moving. It's from his words and his former partner's words and just details how everything went completely sideways. And it just shows you like imagine if you were one of those guys and that's your job.  You're a fuckin cop and you're in this precinct with all these other corrupt cops and you're like, well, this is what we do. So this is what we do. We just corrupt fuck.  It's like the mob mentality with the protests, right? You get a good protest or people protesting a real thing and people that are having a peaceful march doing that stuff. And then you compound they have been locked in their house for two months. Everybody's broke to live and their business is getting fucking weird. They're just going crazy. And but they're doing the protest now. You have some asshole come up with a hammer and break a bunch of windows. They're creating the drama.  It causes a mob mentality. It's like people are smart, mobs are stupid or person is smart. People are stupid. That same thing happened to the cops, right? You're on a team.  One guy starts doing shit like just shoot him in the face of the bean bag. We don't see it. I fucking got him right on. Pass me the gun boom. And they're all doing the same shit.  There's definitely a lot of that. And then they're protecting themselves. Yeah, there's definitely a lot of that. It's there's also there was some crazy shit where it was pretty much proven that some cops were the ones who are breaking windows in Minneapolis.  Oh yeah. There was one in New York where they were sawing, sawing. They like the Roll-Up door open on a a jewelry store.  A cop was doing it. Yeah. They had this video on the video for, oh, there's these cops with like like a fucking one of the miter saw or whatever, cutting the roll up door on the jewelry shop. I think I saw that one.  I was if I might be incorrect, there was people they got a call there, people trapped in there, and they had to get them out. But I've been robbing it.  All right. But like, they had maybe get trapped in their robinett. Yes, I may be mistaken on that one, but I think I saw.  Oh, that's interesting. Me with the fact check. That seems like a weird way to save people. Saw the fucking security door open.  They broke it open in a bad way and like snuck in and I had to get their equipment shit so that they like the metal, something like Hello, 911 one.  Yeah, well, OK, we were robbing this jewelry store.  It seems like the type of thing that you would say when you were caught on camera robbing the jewelry store. Well, actually, there was somebody inside. I was trying to get them out. It was just weird. Thing happens sometimes you get a cop.  That's true, too. Yeah. I mean, how many cops rob things during all the melee? Had to be a lot, right? Come on. They had to.  The one that I saw was a target in Minneapolis where this cop that actually got recognized and he got identified and this cop was smashing windows and these kids really came in. Are you a fucking cop? He's like, fuck off, I'll kick your ass.  And his big guy, that was a guy, Minneapolis with that, he had the full face shield on and everything. And they were like, this guy's wearing like police issue shoes, police issue clothes. So it's a good look at that.  Why would they do that? Why would a cop do that? Because the cop wanted to break shit or is there a plan to get fucking drama started in a certain city and then that police station just happens to burn down and they give it up to, well, I think I'm going to get out of those situations.  What records got destroyed when they burned down that police station? Oh, that's a good point. Joe Schilling's thing on multiple levels, you know what I mean? I think what happens with a lot of this, you know, it's called an agent provocateur. Right. And what they've used those people for before is to stop a peaceful protest. And the way they stop a peaceful protest, they turn it violent. And then they then then they have the authorization to go in and break break up the protest and arrest people.  And that has been done. That absolutely has been done. That was done with the World Trade Organization protests in the early 2000s. They did that in Seattle. That shit has been done. They do. It might be neat late 90s, but they fucking do that.  That is a government tactic and say you have a good protest and it has a good meaning and a good thing. And that's bad for you. If you're the government, you're just like, I don't really like this. Exactly what do we do here?  Let's get some fucking assholes to go in there and start some shit. We hadn't let these people leave their house in two months. They're going to do some dumb shit. Yeah. So we're. Start bashing up shit, you know what, let's play some fucking bricks, mate. We put some bricks on the street where all these people are going to come. They're going to fuck all this shit up here.  The brick thing was weird. You know, in some circumstances, the bricks actually were there because of construction. That's been proven. There was one that was a synagogue in North Hollywood. And we were and there was these like bricks set up right in front of the synagogue. We're like, this is fucked up. Like, what is this about? Turned out even worse. The bricks had actually been there for a long time and they were there to keep people from driving into the synagogue.  They were to stop a car from smashing through the front windows and killing people. So they were worried after like the Pittsburgh mass shooting and a couple other mass shootings, they were worried about their synagogue. So they set up these bricks to keep some fucking psycho from driving a car through the building.  Which is I mean, almost worse, almost, rather than I mean, we have that everywhere, though, right? We have that and like Sunset Boulevard or wherever they'll be like those concrete post like. That's a that's a normal thing, I think.  I guess. But this is one that breaks because it was like set up by these folks that ran the synagogue in the city, didn't even protect it.  They had to do it themselves.  Yeah, I'm pretty sure. I mean, I think City probably approved it. Right. But it's it's a weird city find.  I saw the picture there in, like, cages, right? Yeah. Weird thing. You can buy a Home Depot, I guess.  Oh, you can't for that reason, in case you're going to synagogue that's being targeted by white supremacists over the cities.  And I got you back here.  I worried about the cops showing up. We're going to put these put these black piles and shit.  It's just this this whole covid and then the George Ford protest and then the riots and the looting and everything that really highlights how fragile our civilization is really, really shows everybody.  Yeah.  And how easily we are controlled through the media. Yeah. Easily were controlled. I try not to watch it anymore because, like, it's you just getting brainwashed. And once you realize you're just being brainwashed, like it is control how you feel about everything. They control you. You hate this guy. Change the channel. The guy's a good guy. This guy is this guy. It's just all misinformation.  Yeah. The Who and Falchi. One day that they'll do mass. You don't need mass the next day or you need a mask.  Cuomo needs 50000 respray better leaders and that puts them all in the nursing homes and all the news people die.  Yeah, but let's not talk about that. Yeah.  That's the Cuomo nursing home thing is a giant scandal, man. He let those people go back to the nursing homes. They infected and killed thousands of people because of that.  And and so his numbers go straight up, you know, and then like, why are we incentivizing? We're even going to the why are we incentivizing hospitals to say that they were covered deaths? What is the purpose of that? It makes no sense.  I think the idea was because this was a new disease and they required more fun. Like financially, it's more difficult to treat those people that they allocated more money towards people that had covid. But when you do that, you do incentivize people to mark deaths as quickly as people who get shot.  And they were like had covid when he died. But did they test recovered? A lot of I just wrote it there. But there are also numbers come out.  Apparently, there have also been a bunch of people that died and weren't covid tested, did they do believe died because of complications for Kofod, too? So the idea is that it could even possibly balance it out. They don't know. But there are a lot of people that have like here's a deceptive one that I've read.  It was really fucked up. They were talking about this kid who was I think he was 17, who died from covid. And they said he was they were said he was healthy. No, under no other health issues, they said.  But then you read the article deeper. It turns out he had diabetes, he had type one diabetes, and he was 400 pounds. And it's like, wait a minute, the that's not no issues. These articles are full of shit. And they write those articles just so that you click on them because they get the fucking ad revenue from clicks. That's so they're incentivized to trick you into being scared like, oh my. Got a seventeen year old dad.  What my seventeen year old can die. Holy fuck. And then you click on it and if you don't read, you know, six, seven paragraphs into the article, you don't find out that this is a 400 pound diabetic kid that you know, has would have died from the flu three months earlier.  Would have been the same show. Yeah. Yeah. You know, so the numbers are fudged. So I don't I don't want to believe your numbers don't come to me with more scare tactics, but the numbers are spiking. But you already said that fifty percent of the positives are false positives.  Well, he's finally they're saying when they said the numbers are spiking, I haven't heard the fifty percent or false heard that video.  There was that chick that is with Falchi.  The other one she was saying fifty percent. Yeah.  I don't know how old the video was that our testing is. We're coming up. And if you have one percent of whatever and we tested and fifty, you know, you're about half of the positives are false positive. Jesus.  And then don't wear a mask and you have to wear a mask. And he said the whole reason we have to flatten the curve is because it can live on anything for up to like nine days and even an asymptomatic person can still transmit it. Then it comes out, they say the exact opposite. Yeah.  Now they're saying asymptomatic people very, very rarely transmit it.  I don't choose to believe that. I are going to believe what they told me the first time is going to be what do I say? That's not the new facts that they have now. So we're still going to wear masks all the time.  Yeah, people get mad at you if you suggest differently. There's a lot of people that like being scared, too, and like, fuck you, wear your goddamn mask.  We need to protect people. Love it.  But meanwhile, there's no police who's going to protect you and you who's going to protect your family. Me beanball.  There was no BEATTIES people weren't freaking out when you seen these mass protests and the spikes. Guess what happened right after the protest. And at least they're saying that now. At least they're saying they're being forced into saying it's probably connected to the protests.  Well, of course. Or it's just one human contact.  Get people to scare them to to stop revolting. Let's get them. Let's get them. Chill out. We got you know, now the numbers are spiking.  Guys, do you think it's that calculated that that's what they're doing? I think there's a lot of calculated shit going on.  There's too many weird things going on. I'm like, who's calculated? I think that it's Dr. Evil. Oh, I think it is.  I think that they're there and like they're thinking, next, we're going to launch the sharks with laser beams on their head.  What happened to murder hornets? They came and went real quick. I was really worried about them. Fuck, I put it out there. Well, Enza are coming before before the election, the alien thing is interesting because there's quite a few like real legitimate studies, including black ops studies that are going on right now on aliens, particularly after the David Fraser incident, which was Air Force incident that was off the coast of San Diego. That was all documented in terms of the speed of the aircraft, the fact that they were tracking it, the fact that it blocked their their tracking systems.  So it was an active object blocking the track to tracking systems. And it also went from something like right above the surface of the water to 60000 feet in a matter of a second, like whatever the fuck that thing is, it violates all laws of propulsion. And all those Air Force guys were saying, yeah, we've been following these things. They've been down here for the last few weeks. Like every now and then we'll see one and they'll hover above the water and dunk down into the water.  They don't know what the fuck they were.  And, you know, this David Favre guy who's like a rock solid, buttoned down military man, he is not a bullshit artist. He's not a guy who needs a lot of attention. He came on the podcast and relayed his experiences with this thing. And there's not just one of them. And they behave very similarly. If they had him on the East Coast. I'm doing a terrible job of giving all the facts about how they operate and how how they move, but they defy all the known laws of propulsion.  They have no idea what they are. They have no idea where they're coming from. They don't know what they're doing. But these things behave in some really almost supernatural way in terms of like what we know about physics.  And this is like unclassified now or this is recent.  Well, the government's come out and said I mean, they've they've openly said there's a real issue. Trump says he's heard very interesting things about Roswell, site of an alleged UFO event. President was asked by. So, yeah, that was nonsense, though. Would you see that interview? First of all, the whole interview was weird. Like Donald Trump Jr is interviewing Donald Trump and he's he's not even doing it like he's his dad. You know, like if I was sitting there with my dad, I believe I did.  Tell me what's up?  What's going on with the aliens? What's going on with them when you got back there, dude?  And also I would ask that question four fucking years ago, day one, I'd be like, come on, dude, as soon as soon as you walked me in.  Yeah, let's talk. I would run for president just to find out just how we should run for president. Job. Dude, you should absolutely run for president.  Listen, I could cancel all Joey ideas conversation. You could you could do like the presidential addresses and just do a stand up at the whole time.  Every time that would it would have to be that would have to be like some seriousness and some like some, you know, life is so preposterous and it's more preposterous now than it's ever been before. It's not. And then meanwhile, there's no standup. The only person doing standup right now has been there's a few guys that just started doing shows. I'm actually in Houston this weekend for the first time in three months. I haven't done any standup. Chappelle's doing regular shows in Ohio.  Really. He's got a outside wedding like pavilion and he's got set up where everybody's socially distanced. They all wear masks in the crowd. They have Chapell masks. So they'll have like the sea on their mask. They're in the crowd. And it's my buddy Darnell did it and he said he loves it. And Dave's like, listen, man, I got to do something. I got to figure this out. It's all been approved by the governor.  Everybody's, you know, distanced six feet apart. They all maintain social distancing during the show. They wear masks during the show.  How long what's this? How long are we going to keep doing this?  Texas governor urges people to stay home as states report surges of new covid-19 cases. Yeah, you want to see the photo of the Austin protest? You've seen it. It's crazy. You know, Austin, which is the most progressive city in Texas, had this insane protest, which listen, I think is great. I do I think it's great that people want to show solidarity, that people want to to get out there and let everybody know that they're they're not down with police brutality and that they're they're they're down with racial equality and that you got all these thousands and thousands of people together to have the same positive message.  I love it, however, that covid doesn't give a fuck about racial equality or social justice.  If you're if you're not healthy, it's going to get you I don't know.  And the case spike. But the other thing about Texas is a giant percentage of it. I think somewhere in the neighborhood of 50 percent is actually in prisons. So when they're talking about statewide issues, did you do you have an image so I can get an image for you?  I got a good one for you. Oh, that's a good one. Yeah, that'll cause a problem. Look at those fucking people. But one thing they have found out, if you guys if you guys are going to protest, protest during the day, and this is why there's been a new study that came out that said that covid-19 dies almost instantly in contact with sunlight.  So Trump say that like two months ago and everyone said he was crazy. You know, he was saying, like, put lice in the body, like you said, when the summer comes that he he kills it.  But it's not. But it's not the heat. It's actually light. So the nighttime is just as dangerous in the summer. It is as it is during the day. It's not heat. It's not a temperature issue. I'm sure some temperature kills it.  Joe, this thing is not real, bro. No, it's just not real. Real. It's not real. Let a joint. It is the fucking flu. Yeah, let's do it. Do it.  Well, it's not real. You don't think it's real?  I think that the flu is real. I think that people get sick from the flu every year and die. I think that it's a it's a bad thing. I don't think that all of this nonsense is going on and they keep keep perpetuating it and keep perpetuating and keep perpetuating it. It's. Come on. Well, I was not buying anyway, I just. You guys, you change your views, change your opinions.  It's like it's like if you were the writer of a TV show, say, friends, your job would be to write a 30 minute episode that was funny and intriguing and dramatic and fucking scary or whatever the fuck.  And the media just writes an episode and then the next day they're like, write a new episode and write a new episode and they change their shit.  I understand why you sent such bullshit. I understand why you said I'm going to give you a different perspective, OK? This is the different perspective. The different perspective is legit. Biologists have analyzed the actual virus itself and they find all sorts of problems with this virus. I had Bret Weinstein on the podcast the other day. He's a professor, a legit biologist, and he was discussing all of the indicators in the virus that seemed to point to the fact that this has probably been leaked from a lab.  And he explained it in terms of the way viruses evolve. I'm going to do a terrible job of paraphrasing it because I'm a moron and he's brilliant. But when he said in the long run, what he's basically saying is this is a very legit virus. It's very complicated because of the fact that it's been fucked with because this is not a virus like, you know, like a regular cold or like anything else that we've encountered before. This is something that's really complicated and may have evolved because it came from a lab, his perspective, as it may have evolved to transmit better indoors.  And it's very vulnerable to UV light, which also might be part of, you know, it being from a lab and not something that existed in the wild that actually just jumped from a bat to a pangolin to a person or what have you. So legit scientists and biologists who are not a part of the narrative, they're not working for any government agency. They're not part of the news media that's trying to transmit propaganda. They are concerned with it and they're concerned with it for very specific scientific reasons.  Now, me as a person who doesn't know what the fuck any of that stuff I just said means really I just repeat it. It sounds like I'm smart, but they the smart people actually are worried about it for very specific reasons that it could explain to you. Now, it's not vulnerable for a lot of people. They're not going to be vulnerable like pro athletes. We were talking about those NBA players that get it. Listen, those are top of the food chain stud athletes.  They shake it off. They're not experiencing any symptoms, you know, over and over and over again.  There's a lot of people that get Idris Elba shook it off. There's a lot of people that get it, shake it off. They barely get it. They barely even know they have it.  But they're really robust, healthy people. The concern is people that aren't old people, people that are vulnerable when they get it, man, they get it bad.  And I was reading an article today about a woman who's been sick with covid for a hundred days now, and she still has days. She has like these horrible flu like symptoms and she gets real easy. But I think she has multiple sclerosis and she's got some other underlying health conditions. So those people have to really be worried about this because it's not predictable and they don't know how to treat it totally, especially in the beginning. Turned out when they put people on ventilators, my buddy Michael Yo got it.  And he got it early on and his doctor told him, if I put you on a ventilator, you're probably going to die because your body's going to stop breathing for itself.  It's going to let the ventilator do all the work, the ventilator, like 90 percent of people put on ventilators.  I think it's eighty eighty percent for anything ever die. Is that true? I don't know. That's what I to say, 80 percent. So when the question is almost like we need 40000 ventilators because who are you saving when 80 percent of those people are going to die?  The thing is, though, like I think the ventilator, one way you could look at it, the ventilator is such a last ditch effort that by the time you get to that, what does that what do you think?  God, why is your school delicious, but happy for you? What a good man. He brings his own beer in fucking style with all kinds of girls. Oh, I brought you some nice stuff, too. Oh, nice dance.  And shout out the damn blaring. Right writing a book.  He I think he did write this book. Yeah. Yeah. This is dog stuff right. Yeah. That one's for Marshall. Oh yeah. He'll love it. My dog's been using it too. It's really good stuff. OK. You know. Damn everything's the best. Yeah.  No I'm sure he's it's funny how he's jump balls deep into weed and CBD. All right, look at that dog CBD. He even says it on there. I fucked up with CBD and I took some of their dog. CBD was delicious. Peanut butter flavor.  I think it's fine, though, I'm sure.  Why not the CBD? But they make it flavors for dogs. What's that? Cause more shit.  Yeah, this generous fellow. All right. Oh, cool. And t shirts and shit.  What is the symbol for. What is all that. What is the ram says. I think it's a goat head. It seems like I asked him once about it. I can't remember what the answer was, but I think it's always been like his thing.  That's that's like Satan, right. What is the one the the devil that has the goat head, is it Beelzebub? Sounds good. It sounds like that would be correct.  All right. Thank you, Dan. Thank you, Satan. No, what is it? Which one?  You got to be careful. You know, you get people so high that they get super paranoid.  They look down that go that baphomet. Oh, Baphomet. That's right. I've seen him on things before. That's like something Duncker would know a lot about.  I was trying to think I don't think it works. He said, yeah, come on, man. Hey, Dan, why is that guy on the cover?  Your fucking price was that goat dude with with eagle wings, dude.  Now the guy is creepy as fuck with his pentagram on his head.  That's interesting, Houston ICU capacity could soon be exceeded as covid-19 hospitalizations worsened and all the videos come out and it's like people and going to the hospitals and there's no lines that they're trying to make it out to be. You know, there's a lot of there's a lot of thuggery going on with this misinformation.  And that's just a little bit of that all the time. There's a little bit of that in the newest of the new, but there's also real shit going on.  OK, Dr. Peter Hotez, he's been on the podcast before, National School of Tropical Medicine Diseases Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine. He's a brilliant guy. It says the city of Houston, which is known for its medical schools, has a large concentration of beds and research, hospitals and whatnot, and they're very close to running out of all of their ICU beds.  He said he called on the state to reimpose more aggressive social distancing restrictions. So he's not a he's not a foolish person. If he's saying this is a legit scientist and a doctor and he knows a tremendous amount about diseases. I met him many, many years ago. He kind of freaked me out because we're doing this. I interviewed him for this sci fi thing and he was telling me that people that live in tropical climates all have parasites. And like all of them, he goes, all of them.  So everybody's got something. He's like that's you're living in this like soup of moisture and heat. And it's just a perfect breeding ground for all these diseases. And a lot of these Third World countries, poor folks that live in these tropical climates, he's like they all have it. And we've seen that. I was like, well, the course that makes sense. There's no antibiotics. No, it's probably just a normal part of life to have all these different parasites.  Hmm, like people used to just train system because it gets better off it or they just don't know, maybe just live with it, it might be both. You know, some people's immune systems might be stronger, but like creek water, like that's what people drank, man. They just drank creek water. And you would get beaver fever, you get giardia.  It was a normal thing. You know, people like he would like talk about Mexico, right? People always say, don't drink the water, don't drink the water. Well, they're fucking drinking water all the time, but their their system is just more it's more tolerant of it.  Or they just used to sharpen their pencils a little bit that maybe a little bit of that's just yet.  But I imagine like Bieber fever has got a jati is probably killing people. I mean, you're drinking like horrible bacteria. I know people have died from E. coli or one of the died from a disease kill you.  Because that's a normal thing you get if you drink out of a creek, so your guy that you were talking about, the really smart guy, Peter Hotez, Peter Hotez, he says it was made in the lab then.  OK, no, that's Brett Weinstein. That Weinstein. Yeah, he's the biologist. He he said he does not talk like that. He's not say like it was made in a lab. He's like all indications would point to he's one of those guys and but he's he's never like so therefore it does.  So that would support the one lab that's not far from the one.  Rarely does guardianships real close. Rarely does giardia infection cause death. But each year, 4600 persons with giardia chardy ISIS because they are estimated to be hospitalized. The United States hospitalisation, usually primarily children under five and dehydration are the most frequent co diagnosis, huh? Yeah, probably dehydrated.  And then you drink that shitty water, like the fact that dehydration is like one of the coinciding factors, like, yeah, water gets you so sick that you piss and shit both water out of you.  Yeah. Baby, you're dehydrated when they're sick. Yeah. That's probably better perspective.  That's ideal for it.  Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do you take any electrolytes like we do training. Not really. Dude, I just started over the last one year I started taking one of my sponsors, they sent me this liquid I.V. stuff.  Electrolytes make a big fucking never. Really. Yeah. It makes a big difference in how quickly you hydrate. It makes a big difference in stopping cramps stops all the cramps.  I heard of being dehydrated. Any level of dehydration reduces athletic output by like twenty percent, which is one of the things I've been fucking sound the alarm on forever.  We're going to stop. We're cutting. Right, guys. I want I want people to fight healthy and I want them to fight for as long as they can. Look, DC had kidney failure before. I mean, that's why he didn't get into the Olympics at one point. Kidney failure. Daniel Cormier. Hmm.  You know, he's had real problems from cutting weight. Man, it's fucking terrible for you. That's why you fight so good at heavyweight. Yeah.  You know, when he said heavy weight, he doesn't have to deal with any of that bullshit. He could just eat and train and just recover when you're dehydrating yourself to that extent, to the extent that some guy like Paulo Costa, that motherfucker Charleson had a video he had on YouTube, I urge you to go to jail, send summons YouTube and listen to him talk about it. He was watching Paul had Paul and 230 plus pounds. He cuts down to one eighty five for a fight.  That's insane.  That's how does he get before it's just water? I don't know, man. You got to see the video of him now. He looks like a fucking heavyweight. You know, he recovered from surgery, right? So he had I believe he severed one of his biceps after his fight with Youghal. So he had to get it reattached. And it's a long recovery process.  So I guess he just got big he's huge.  Man was like Anthony Johnson. Yeah. He was like fighting it with 1770 when he was on the local circuit out here. And he's fighting at seventy and keep going up, keep going, up, going, up.  Thing is, if he can make seventy for the first, you know, few minutes until his body starts giving out. Holy shit.  That dude's terrified of what weight classes it was like heavyweight motherfucker bro.  Icing people like Glover to share with one punch as a light heavyweight and he just throws everything with zero fucks on zero five.  I love it. He's like, you're going to hate me now or giving it.  You got an iron chin. That's a big factor. Like Anthony can take it. You can't just put him out. He had so goddamn hard man. The fuckin Inotera punch, when he clipped him with that uppercut and flat lined them, he did the same thing to go over. He just he could take people out with one shot like nobody else in the sport.  And Glover was on like a 20 fight or some crazy, crazy shit. Right? Well, he lost to John Jones before that. John Jones did some really clever shit in that fight. And he did something that I'm kind of amazed that people don't do more often. John had an over hook on Glover's arm and they were in the clinch and John wrenched his fucking arm up in a way that I've never seen before. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Like like almost, you know, like a shoulder.  Like he got him in some kind of a shoulder lock and he did it from there. Right. So John has his arm like he's got glovers got to like gave him the under hook and John's got his arm and syas right there and John that's a million bucks.  You get his fucking shoulder. And afterwards Glovers tell me he's like, oh my shoulders fucked. He kept fighting the fight with it but made a big impact on his ability to throw the right hand and grapple. It was pretty savage shoulder crank. It was pretty savage, man. It's pretty savage. And what's interesting is, again, it's not. Let's see it. Let's watch it. Very rare man. Look at that. Oh, and did a couple times, dude.  I mean, he's he fucked his shoulder there and we all have fucked up shoulders and everybody just so bad, such a weird joint. Yeah, and for a guy like John, who, first of all, has massive leverage, this is a terrible cosmology.  He's about to cause such about money. That's due to Futch, Sage Northcutt in one F.C. and nobody saw it coming. I saw that line up.  I was like, totally what's going to happen? They want that to happen for sure. There's something about what they've seen. I'm not I'm not saying the UFC wouldn't do the exact same thing because they absolutely would. But they would love to have those guys come in and have them go over there and get their ass kicked. The only one who's, like, proved everybody wrong is not even prove them wrong with proven is greatness in that regard is J because J.  Still dominating Mighty Mouse is still dominating even over there. They're throwing their best killers at him and he's still dominating.  But he's just so he's so good. He's so good.  If you want to cheat somebody like you want to show somebody what like the best is, they might that might have. Yeah. Not no argument.  I say the goat is Jon Jones and I say the goat is Jon Jones because Jon Jones beat everybody in his fucking division. He's never lost to anybody. Anybody.  You can't look at Jon at Jon Jones and the guy's like a fucking huge fucking insane. He's huge and it's fucking insane. Look how big he is. He's so big. So Charlestonians video's excellent, he says he's two hundred and thirty plus pounds and look, not fat gigantic. So, John, I think John's the goat, John's beat everybody, he turned back every single challenge he's never lost once. The only fight that he has an L was the disqualification of fight.  He was totally dominant manimal. If anything, that fight should be changed to a no contest. And and also that rule should be amended. It's a silly rule.  It doesn't make any super stupid rule. It's one of the dumbest rules that we still keep.  It's again, another thing where I say, like, we all know it's stupid, but they don't change it. You know, it's crazy, dude.  It's not even the best elbow. Like, you know, it's not the best elbow. That's not the best elbow. But you're an elbow expert. You can speak to this. Yeah. Just touch them up. Joe Schilling, a great start. A great elbow. It's OK. It's a fun elbow from waitI like that. That elbow is like it's g shit for sure.  Is love doing that for sure.  Doing that, if you could step on a dude's thigh and own back. I'm right in the fucking dump. Oh yeah.  I'm never I'm not going to buck anybody but like a jump like any time I fought in Thailand I always had at least one or two of those in the fight. I'm sure I'm going to throw that. But that's not the that's not the most dangerous. Like they wait the story a hundred times.  But they thought because he could break blocks of ice that that it's too dangerous. That's what they said.  But meanwhile, that that position doesn't even exist on the ground anyway. If they understood leverage of, like the human body, the position of the position of standing, I just killed the light.  Oh, sorry. We have this floating magnetic light that I just killed.  Did I pull the thing out of the plugs over there? Yeah. What was I just saying? John Jones, the Go Mighty Mouse is on the elbow elbow was though.  So that's the only reason why John Jones ever lost is because he did the downward elbow. Right. And most people thought that stop, which is ridiculous. Come on, man. He just won the fight. He won the fight. You can't take it away from him for that. And it did. That had almost no impact on the fight. He was going to fuck him up. He was fucking him up before that. He was going to fuck them up there.  Yeah, don't they should take away that for all, first of all. But two, you can't take that and turn it to a loss. That's not a loss.  And it's always a grey area anyway. When you do the elbow, every time I asked them about it and they're always like, you know, as long as there's an arc. Show me an arc. You watch that video, you could definitely show that there was some sort of arc on some angle that's not that big a deal. And mammals get his ass kicked anyway. Who's getting there was that there was not changing the impact.  He was getting smashed by the goat. That's really what it was for sure. So there's him. John Jones does the top of the food chain, I think just by results. Undeniable, but then technical. It's Mighty Mouse. Mighty Mouse is the most technically gifted guy I've ever seen inside the act. I mean, gifted in any negative way. Like he didn't have to work for it. I mean, talented. I mean, just but he puts it together, gifted in that he had Matt Hume for an instructor for sure.  That's a big factor because that guy is a real bona fide martial arts wizard and has been for since I can remember.  I've always was the guy that people were talking about. You know, he knows so much. Rich Franklin was. He was Chip was working with him, too.  And, you know, he actually fought Pat Miletich way back in the day. Dude, those guys were like legit pioneers, but Mad Humes always been super, super technical. So you got D.J., who's like Matt Hume, who's like one of the great minds of the sport. And then you got this star pupil is like the most spectacular, talented and technical fighter in terms of like just overall technique. I think Mighty Mouse is the most spectacular example of mixed martial arts I've ever seen.  And as a as like a champion and as like a marketable person never gets in trouble.  And Cooper. Nice, super nice guy. Super nice guy. Please don't have an asterisk. That would be a disaster. Great.  But like John Jones is wild motherfucker. That's what he is. Also a wild motherfucker. So be careful. He's wild, is going to make mistakes, are going to do wild, crazy shit. He's also going to open up on Mauricio Shogan, who in the youngest ever time a person wins UFC title opens up that fight with a flying knee on Mauricio Shogan. Who who the fuck does that like? You got to be a wild motherfucker. Sure.  You got your title fight. You're twenty two years old. You're in there with a fuckin legend from pride and you open with a fly on Instagram and one up stopping them, whatever.  That's the goat. That's the goat.  But then you got Anderson Silva in his prime like, oh, Anderson Silva. This problem was terrifying when he front kick Vitor in the face when Anderson Silva was in his probably smashed son in the rematch, even when he caught Chilson in a triangle off his back and a fight where he went into that fight with fucked up ribs, he probably shouldn't even taking that fight. And Childress kept taking him down. He couldn't stop the takedown and eventually got him in a triangle off his back.  And it's like, oh, shit, the rich Franklin fight. Oh, my God, be rich, Franklin.  It was like no one. Like, what is this clinched?  That is what is you know, no one was that crazy for you to watch because you were fighting more time. Yeah.  And it was like Richard didn't know how to defend. But it was still at that level, and I think it was fucking phenomenal. I mean, it was phenomenal, this spectrum. Well, he was one of the most technical strikers ever at that point. We'd never seen a guy who moved that good. And I had seen him fight a bunch of times in price. But then when he went to greatness was like when he was like 30 ish, because that's when he started fighting in Cage Warriors with Tony Freckling, the markward Albert Batbold elbow and Tony Ficklin.  And that he fought, oh, God damn it, he fought quite Olie Murray.  That was a big one. That was when Lee Murray was a straight up killer.  We talk about leverage every time on the show. A great story. Every time you have to talk about head fetish. He's a God damn Guy Ritchie movie. Yeah. Lee is a Guy Ritchie movie. Yeah, he's a human Guy Ritchie movie. Four people don't know who he is. He he robbed a bank with a bunch of other dudes and they got away with like five hundred million dollars. And then he jetted off to Morocco for a little bit, was hiding out over there, and then eventually got caught.  And now he's in jail and was actually at one point in time, he was losing weight to try to slip in between the bars. He was convinced that if he could get down to a certain weight, he get through the bars.  There should be this should be a movie about it for sure. I think Guy Ritchie has got to be on the case. Yes, anybody's making that movie. It's going to be Guy Ritchie. That'll be great. But yeah, it'll be great.  Um, but.  Oh, you already Rivera, too. That was another fight over there when he fought George Rivera in Cage Warriors. That was the one where he let him punch him in the face. You remember that? The interest in a couple of them right in front of them, he stood right in front of them and he had to go ahead and he punched them. He said he punched and he turns and he's like, marches him down, starts kicking. Oh, it's crazy.  See if you can find that, because it's remember that it's one of those ones where Mark telegraphed was in Hoorays Corner and he said he's seeing him punch Anderson in the face like, oh, shit, he's going to fuck them up. Oh, she's going to. And he goes when Anderson feels nothing and doesn't even react like, oh, no.  Oh, no. Because, I mean, he tees off with, like, several clean punches on Anderson and Anderson's letting him do it. And then Anderson just starts marching him down and beating them up, and that was what I was accustomed to. So I had seen those big three fights over in Cage Warriors. And so then when he came to the UFC and he fought Chris Lee and I was like, oh, my God, bet the house on the Brazilian for sure.  Here it is right here. This is the fight. And this is and by the way, that this organization, its cage warriors. Right. Cage rage. Cage rage.  Yeah, that's right. Cage Warriors is a big organization now. Right. OK, that's right. Cage cage rage.  So this is argument for fence instead of to the chain link fence. That's a cartel. That's right.  So this organization had some great fights, man. There was some really big fights that came out of here where guys like these two were going at it. And then eventually Anderson rolls on to become the goat. And this was like Rivera had been fighting in the UFC with much success. He was a good guy, very tough guy.  But this was this was a fight where, you know, Anderson just kind of showed how far ahead he is. So you standing right in front of Marched goes down, I do remember at one point time just let him start punching him, he just knew how to move away from shit just enough. And the thing about a guy that fights like Anderson, it's you know, he's such a fucking insanely high level for these three or four years. This fight, the veter fight the two fights with Rich Franklin.  Like, I really feel like for an athlete, a real elite athlete, this is the time like look at this. He's like standing in front of him in the clinch and he's letting him punch him in the face. He hit them like three or four times in the face like this. This is this is saying, look, he's just letting them hit him. Look, look at look at this. He's letting them hit him. And that's when Dahlgren feels like, oh no, because George is a big puncher.  So for Anderson to clinch with him and let him punch him in the face like that and they just start marching him down, they were like, how do we win this fight? And this was Anderson in his prime and then Anderson in his prime, you know, when he fought Chris leave. And that's Anderson in his prime right now. There was quite a few fights where he exhibited an insane level of ability.  Yeah, the ledman fight was like, oh, my God, it was terrifying shit. This dude just fucking iced you.  Yeah, I had a few friends come to that and I was telling my dude, go bet on this guy.  I think he threw like 100 percent like shouted through like, dude, get everything landed and then finished. Yeah.  And that was back in the day. They didn't know anything like the line, the betting lines. There were wacky guys would come in and people didn't know I got them like that. You got a bet on that guy. Like bet on that guy. They don't know who he is, right? Oh my God. He's going to fuck everybody up. There was a few of those guys, but no better example than Anderson. Like, they're pretty hyped on Anderson being here.  But it wasn't nearly much had been like a thousand to one odds. You know, that was one of those fights where you just like, oh, my God, there's a perfect style to, you know, Matador because LeBron was so powerful and so tough and he would take one to give one like you can't take one to give on with Anderson Silva.  Not not that level of, like, slick feet and stays on and leave it.  It's also like I you know, it's not hard to hit, but the way Anderson pulled it off is like fucking poetry, man. The combinations he hit him with just poetry. Just, you know, if you're a fan of, like, beautiful timing and poise under pressure because Liebman's come in with nuclear bombs, right. Leave and knocked out Vandelay member.  And Liebman's thing was he's dangerous when you hit him. It was after leaving was like four fights or a couple fights in a row were like Lieberman got like drilled and would come back probably rock to blindly to knock a guy out cold.  One of the left hands. There's a few fights like that. He had a few crazy wars. But when he knocked out Vandelay Silva, I was like, holy shit, Chris leaving. You just knocked out the axe murderer. But he was that guy. If he clipped you, man, you had real problems.  He's a tough motherfucker, too. But that style was tailor made for Anderson. So I think, like there's an argument about Anderson, too. There's an argument like if you look at years, you know, like years of being amazing, there's an argument that he's. I mean, God damn, there was a few years where Anderson was just almost untouchable. Yeah, but then you look at like George St. Pierre, you know, like good argument there to almost his whole career, he was untouchable, consistent.  And then when he did lose a fight, he came back in like, you know, justified it and did it.  Well, I think, like, he's got he's got to be up there. Oh, he's got to be at, like, every level of the fight game. Yeah. He would say right fielder under J.  Yup. He's he's in the conversation. Right. I think there's a real problem with having a goat, a goat, because they're all fine.  Different divisions of all time and all time hasn't happened yet. It never ends. It never ends. You know, but who the fuck is going to beat John's record like Chuck Liddell in his day, bro? Chuck. That was like my idol, my hero, you know?  Yeah, he was. It was interesting that Roehampton rampage was his kryptonite. You know, rampages is kryptonite over and pride.  And it shows you like Stiles. You know for sure, some guys have the style to beat certain guys, but to some people will figure their number out. You know, it's such a weird sport, man. There's so many things going on. You know, it's just your transition from going through Muay Thai to kickboxing to May. I mean, you're one of the rare guys like you and Gastón. And there's a a few other dudes who've really competed in all of the major combat sports other than boxing Jeopardy boxing fights that set the U.S. record for the fastest noka in U.S. history.  And you've seen debut. Thank you very much. No shit.  When was this? Five seconds. Oh, wow.  I was fuck all.  You know, I don't even know you, but I had like three professional boxing points. I had about fifteen professional, amateur, professional, amateur. Boxer wants to be able to find a Hollywood Park casino for the guy I supposed to fight. Fernando Fernando Vargas is brother. And he pulled out like the week for the fight and they got some guy from Wild Card.  And this guy like I like his Mike Tyson. I guess he's like, what's his name?  Italian guy. And he had a Mike Tyson tattoo on the side of his face. Oh, my God. And he's got, you know, black high tops with no no socks in the black shorts. And we get in the ring. I'm like, oh my. This dude just looks not there, like not there, you know, like a bad cop.  Like a bad cop. Like you just see him on sight. Like this guy's not all there, right? It's like there's me down. I go back to the corner. And my coach were training for the boxing fight, but he's like I was like, man, this dude's going, trust me, these don't fucking kick him. He's got a arrested out the back. It's like, hit him. So like in boxing, you kick boxing. They always like walks to the center, kind of like like boxing in the gym that, you know.  You ready over there. You're over there to go. So they he said, you know, ready to fight, ready to fight, come on through, and I take like one step forward and I put my left hand out because I know the guy's going to rush me. And sure enough, he just starts sprinting. He's like, run it over and he's going to throw the overhand right. And I was like, oh, shit. And I drop step to the right here.  And he ran into it, knocked him out cold and was five seconds. If I were to take him.  It was tied for the world record at the time or the world record was four seconds. The U.S. record was five seconds. And if I would have taken one step for one more step before I planted and put my foot out to set the record. But anyway, I have a pro boxing.  But dude, the first they they're the first big thing that Glory did at the forum was that the last man standing about the one that you were the last man standing, was that the first big event they did the forum.  First one at the forum. Yeah, that was crazy. Glori 10 the year before, which is when I won the tournament. I thought Artim and Kingo Shimizu.  Yeah, the Artim 11 fight was awesome. And the knee that you caught him with on the way down to was perfect.  Man, I still I, I guess it didn't matter. I won, but I think I knocked him out with a Superman and when he was falling on the way to come up, I hit him with the knee.  I woke him up after a couple of times in my career in that crazy you can actually wake someone up with a punch. You would think you wouldn't care, but it eats at me at night.  I'm like, fuck it had that, you know. Never know, though. That's speculation, right? Right. I don't know. Other than had him fucked up from the punch, too.  But I felt like the need did more damage. I felt like it helped once he it absolutely was. Joe Schilling drops Artem Leverne and he was a bad motherfucker. Man, that guy is so interesting. Bad motherfucker, interesting style.  You know, weird like he's like a real like a real technician, very like slick, very hard to hit.  And he'll throw shit with like no telegraphing, particularly low kicks. They come out of nowhere. There's no step. He just smacks them in there on you sometimes like he'll do it all he has, like all these changeup speeds.  And if you ever watch like or fight, he does like a lot of like I don't feel understand it, but like Russian boxing is a little different.  They have like a little different footwork and their movements and stuff. And Faida Fadeaway does come that stuff. And Artim for sure does it a lot.  Yeah. He's, he's slick man, he's real slick. This is a great fucking fight by the way. This is the this is the very end.  So ask him what is real tall and he's real, real hard to hit. I had a real hard time reaching him with punches, so every time I would throw the right hand, he would lean back just out of just out of range where I couldn't reach him.  And that's why I threw the Superman punch.  So I could just let some of this rule change a few feet farther. Just. Yeah, let's not roll. You just let it roll doesn't man my favorite knockout of yours ever, though, was Simon Marcus. That was crazy. That was crazy because that was a wild ass fight and you were there for rounds and you were there for it.  The arena that night. Oh, my God, dude, that gave me hope for kickboxing. It really did.  It gave me a lot of hope for kickboxing because I was like, the forum is fucking packed and the fights were wild, man. I mean, it was a wild event when you threw that right hand haymaker and caught Simon Marcus on the chin, you see his jaw snap sideways in his mouth.  He's go flying out. That was one of the prettiest knockouts ever. And also because of the fact the fight was so close, it was so much chaos. That fight was wild, dude.  And he dropped you in the second was in the second round up second round. And it was like, oh, it was a fuckin war, man. There was so much heavy bombing on each other. And this is a tournament you had to fight four times that night. Three times, three times, three times do.  And we had fought twice in the past and we had a lot of a lot of animosity. Oh, yeah.  I mean, yes, tension, a lot of tension, a lot of animosity.  We just competitive drive glory kind of got big in the U.S.. We're just after we had started the Mutai had started growing in the US lymphoid, started doing well, and a lot of that happened because of Simon and I used to fight and lie and fight like I started. Can't stop crazy. We started doing our own interviews. We're like giving like talking shit back and forth, like there was like a hype behind. I don't think we better first our purse for the fight.  Oh wow.  And on our first fight. Yeah. First fight we better versus mine was a little bigger. So I matched his purse. But it was still like in the media. It was like knowing that we were betting our purses on the fighters. We sold out the hardrock, the pond or whatever for was the pearl of the pond. The pearl, the pond.  Yeah, you had some wild fights with them.  So when we came back to get beat me twice, beat me twice. So you had to give him up your purse. Yeah. How about that. So I was like six grand but I was only making like not only thing, it was that much was like I think he made like three grand. I mean like how I hope like a thousand bucks which at the time was a lot that sucked. It was terrible. And I wanted the rematch that we had, the rematch and there was controversy behind that too.  And then years later we fought and glory and it was like redemption. And I knocked him the extra rounds.  It was, oh yeah, the fourth round, man. I'll never forget it because after the third I was like, what? They got to go one more round of this because it was such a fucking crazy fight going to bring this.  I'm glad you brought that up. So where were they? Everybody's talking about this week in the fight where the Drysdale was telling him to stop the fight and he was like, Drysdale's like just trying to be a coach, try to keep going. And there's a lot of people are saying if the fighter says he doesn't want to do it anymore, whatever that Simon Mark is by after three rounds. Now, I wasn't begging my coach to stop it, but I did not want to go another fucking round.  And I was like, oh, did I win? I think you're going to do one more. And I'm like, I can't do one more. I don't want to do one more. I can't do it with my coaches like fucking.  You can do it when we're out there and we do it. This is it. Boom. Nope, that's not the punch.  A lot of fighters experience that and it's the coach's job, I think, to keep them to try to keep them going. So I'm on one Drysdale's side on that. But ultimately he didn't fight anyway. They stopped it.  Yeah, well, ultimately he did, but it was very, very controversial. But I get Drysdale's position and listen, in retrospect, like after the conversation is over. Yeah, maybe you should have called it when the guy said call it.  But in the moment, he doesn't know that he can't talk the guy in the fighting and then maybe the guy wins.  Like, you don't know what a person's psychological mindset is like unless you train with that person. Right. And there are some people that you can talk into performing better. Right. That said, he took a lot of fucking punishment that second round. Right. Maybe he knew something. Maybe maybe it was a good thing to stop. There's some times when your body's just broken. There's some times when you shouldn't go on. And this debate, I think, is very healthy.  The debate of whether or not the coach was right or whether or not the guy was right, OK, ultimately the guy's right because you can't go on. So he doesn't and he quits and he's you know, that's his decision. What he only only he knows what was going on with his body. You remember when General McClellan got criticized for taking a knee against Nigel Ben? I don't know if you remember it, but it was that's the fight that put Joe McClellan in a coma and severely handicapped him.  Jerry McClellan at the time was a fucking assassin, man. He was so scary. But he was another guy that cut way too much weight. He cut a lot of weight, man. It was hard for him. He was really big. And so when he would get into the I forget if he's fought one sixty eight, I think it is fine in Roy Jones's division. He's a 168 or 175 yet. Pull up General McClellan versus Nigel Bent.  This was the dark destroyer because Nigel Bent, it was a wild ass fight to not just got crazy dreadlocks and Jack McClellan knocked him through the ropes in the first round because he was smash people. He would just smash people. He was such a crank guy. Right. So he fought Walter Cronkite just moving forward behind the Jap big right hands. Just nasty, vicious puncher. Well, Nigel Benn gets up and he makes it through the round and then turns into a war.  And then Joe McClellan starts getting tired and then they clash heads. And then Nigel Ben hits with a couple of punches late in the fight. And when Nigel Ben hit him, seemed like this is early on. I mean, this is look like this go a little earlier than this. So we could see this combination. But this was Gerry McClellan and everybody was like real keen on him fighting Roy Jones Jr. This is when Roy Johnson was in his prime.  And this was like the big challenge was.  General MacLellan, Roy Jones, Jr., everybody was thinking that was eventually going to have to happen because Gerald was a smash and people and Nigel Bend was tough, man, fucking tough. But look at this. Boom, boom, boom. He's like he's man and he falls through the fucking ropes. You could see he's like, really out of it, but so tough and so conditioned that he makes it back to that. Barely can get through the ropes.  Got a lot of seconds there, though, right? That's probably more than 10 seconds. So anywhere. And look at the referee.  There's more seconds. And Jerrel still teeing off on them and Nigel survives. It doesn't seem like he's going to survive, but he fucking survives. So then late in the fight, Nigel's making a comeback. So scooch way ahead here. And when Nigel starts teeing off on Gerald and Jerrold's punches are coming real slow and he's getting tired and Nigel starts connecting. And I mean, the crowd is going fucking bananas. It is a wild ass fight. And at one point in time, they head butt and then Nigel hits him with some punches and McLaughlan takes a knee and everybody's like, I can't believe this.  He's going to quit. He's going to quit. And then he goes, Who's corner? And then he slumps and goes unconscious like he knew something was wrong. And any anybody that criticizes in the moment, you know, they're saying, I can't believe he's doing this. I can't believe he's fucking he's just going to quit. But he knew something was really off. Only the fighter knows. I mean, maybe it's psychological, but maybe something is wrong.  Maybe he can't think. Maybe his brain is just fucked. Maybe he knows he's not going be able to punch. Right. Maybe he knows. There it is. So he goes down and just decides to stay down. He's like something as fuck and really wrong. He's like out of it.  And you see, this is I mean, he just looks something looks wrong, something looks wrong, you know, he's hurt bad. And Nigel Ben is moving in for the fucking kill and he drops in there with an uppercut and this is where he quits. See, now this is where you see him. He's struggling, man. But if I remember correctly, the commentators were shocked that he decided to stay down.  Yeah, he's quit, so they set it that way and, you know, I think they were, you know, expressing shock that he quit and pretty pumped that Nigel Ben beat him. But they didn't know, you know, and Joe McClellan, that injury scared the fuck out of everybody because he was, you know, one of the golden guys, he was one of the guys that everybody was excited about. It was like, if that happened today, you know, to Ryan Garcia or someone like that, you know, someone who's, you know, real exciting up and coming dude, someone who's, you know, Canelo like if Canelo just gets close, is a bigger star than Gerrold.  But when someone who's of that nature, like an elite super elite fighter, winds up going into a coma like that, that's fucking terrifying shit.  And he came out of it, OK? No, no, he didn't. He died.  Know he's all fucked up. All right. He can't see. And, you know, it's been some videos of Roy Jones Jr. visiting them, but apparently that was responsible for Roy Jones kind of altering his style and being very safety first. And really. Really. Yeah, and just thinking about eventually, you know, getting out of the sport, which is ironic, right. Because you want to fighting later and later and later. And it was like I mean, his last fight just a couple of years ago.  Right. Right. It's crazy. It's while that sport you're in, Joe Schilling, yeah, all the aspects of it, whether it's boxing or Muay Thai or MMR, and when is Bellator going to start having fights again? I don't know. I haven't heard from playing it safe, huh? I guess so.  They don't have to a fight island, I guess.  Hmm. But you cannot find someone who crowds, they're letting people do that. Are they doing that? When you have seized on a few of them and you have seized on it, they test the fuck out of you?  Yeah, I was there with Daniel Rodriguez. That's right. And Bravo. Yeah. And yeah, we were tested every test we first got there the to take our temperature every day and they just they bought the bailout, the whole hotel.  So there was. Yeah, yeah. I was there were social distance the whole time. Yeah.  I think it's and I was in there for that one. That was the biggest one. Right. I think it's, it's OK the way they're doing it, it's, it's working out for everybody. Guys get in a fight. We're all getting to see that like that. Says something about Ferguson versus Gadge to have that in a in an empty arena. Was there something wild about it? For sure. There's some wild about no crowd for sure.  I think it had everything. I think it added. I mean, I don't think it's the right way to do it. I think it's best with the crowd. But it's not a bad thing to have no crowd. No. Yeah, it's been.  Maybe guys can fight better, too. There might be guys who can, like, stay more calm because there's less energy.  Yeah, for sure. I could see a lot of people feeling that way. Probably. Yeah, probably. Right. But because God damn, they've had some fucking wild fights that JT Ferguson fight wasn't.  So what a fucking how do you how do you watch that fight.  You're not a tremendous fan of both of them. After both of them. Both.  Yeah, yeah. I mean, both of them do. Gage is a stud. The fact he just figured out he just figured out how to just take a little bit off, take a little bit off, step away a little bit, sometimes come in at angles, faint sometimes don't just maul people because he was just he was breaking people's will before.  You know, I think Trevor Whittman and his relationship is like really special. Yeah. Got a lot to do with and him being able to say exactly what he needed to hear to do what they did. That was really it was really impressive.  There's that for sure. Wittman's a bad motherfucker and he's very smart. And he got he loves Gaging. He loves his athletes and he loves the sport. No doubt about that. You know, Trevor's a wizard. He really is. But gages something special, man, something special about that kid's mind. It's his body for sure. He's got, you know, awesome skills, one of the best, like leg kickers in the clinch I think I've ever seen.  Right. Like he knows how to like while you're tying up in the Clint, you're fucking just a little little step and a nasty leg kick.  He's fucking a gas tank and a workhorse and a fucking throwing bombs and like and walks to the cage like he's getting to his truck to go to work in the morning.  Like there's almost like there's no emotions, there's nothing, no nerves, no weirdness, no craziness.  I don't remember the exact quote. I'm not even going to bother saying it, but it was something fucking iconic as fuck he was talking about. The fight is easier to knock me out. Going to knock him out in this way. It's going to be. And it was he said it way better than that, but no way you could read it and not respect the fuck out of them. The way he said it was, though, that's the way he fights to.  Yeah. I mean, cool, dude. Even the fights that he's lost, the Poyet fight and the Eddie Alvarez fight. Fucking amazing fights, man. And he almost lost to Michael Johnson fight. Michael Johnson had a buying real estate on Quere Street. He was dancing all over the place. I mean, it was it was wild that he survived that because Johnson has a nasty left hand and he clipped him with several punches like big shots he had.  GAIGE You wobbled like real warbled. That's one of those fights. Could have easily gone the other way. Johnson could have caught him with one more shot to the poor.  Yeah. Yeah, it was anyone anyone could have that fight and leg was shot, man.  He chops legs like nobody. Man crazy came out. He's a wrestler wrestler. Never wrestling. No, never Espinosa anybody. But that's what makes him so dangerous for KUCB. Right. Because Kabab is the wrestler who always wrestles, obviously showed he could drop. Koner obviously shows he's fast as fuck with his hands on his feet drop guys before. But he's not going, he's not a kick boxer in the sense that like he is right. When you see Gadge fighting, he's basically a kickboxer, I mean, with a wrestling background skill so that you can't take him down.  So he's forcing the kickboxing, but he stands straight up. You know, he's standing like a Ostreicher. He stands like a striker, like so does whorey. Masvidal. Yeah. He stands straight up.  Minnesota is really, really good at his fight with me. It was fucking awesome. Nasty.  He's so good, man. So good. So clever. So good. So funny. He's hilarious.  I think he's hilarious. I really like both those guys. You know what else is he's fucking mean. That's a mean dude. It's something like when when they asked him about the Ben Offscreen shot, was it necessary to punch him again on the ground? It was super necessary in there. So that became like a big hashtag. Super necessary. Hilarious. Like, it's hilarious.  Hey, man, he's in the fucking hurt game. You can't play your bullshit for sure nonsense in the first game.  And if everybody's picking a gimmick. Or whatever, and then try to push them, was trying to be Connor, why not be yourself? Whose fuck?  Yeah means you're your media and super talented, so slick, so much experience. People don't know that.  I knocked out Eve Edwards with a head kick and bow dog named Eve Edwards. And Eve Edwards is a slick striker, especially back then. That was Eve Edwards when Eve Edwards was arguably the best 155 pounder in the world.  That was after he knocked out George Thompson in that highlight reel where he throws that that round kick off, back spinning, bounce back for and he throws around taking catches him right in the nets still at the of sees the clip and it's Josh Buck.  And Thompson is one of the toughest guys to ever live. Another monster. Another monster. I mean, that was the last guy to knock out Nate before.  Yeah. Before Masvidal had stopped him. He was the first guy to ever stop Nate. Right. You know, and Josh is as good as it gets. You know, when you see that fight.  I mean, that was two guys easily could have done the same to each other and just timed it, played out that way, landed the perfect shot.  And it was a net kick. It was just fucking spectacular at that time. It was thought to be absolutely one of the very best fighters in the world, probably the best 155 pounder. A lot of us. The UFC change the division. They gave up that 155 division back then. I remember it. It was very disheartening. Yeah. Seems like there's so much talent in this division, but they were hemorrhaging money. Man, this is all pre ultimate fight.  They didn't know what they were doing in terms of like the future. They were forty four million dollars in debt.  They were like, what do we do? We're going to sell this. We're going to keep it. They just had their balls, though. Lorenzo Fertitta, Frank Fertitta and Dana White, all three of them have balls. They were just like, let's just let's just ride. Let's let it ride. They were calling Dana up. Go and look for a buyer. Let's find a buyer. We've got to get out of this like we're not going to lose our family's fortune.  We're 44 million dollars in the hole in this cage fighting. Obviously, this is too brutal for America.  They're not really into it. Then they figured it out. That ultimate fighter show. They financed the whole show, paid for all of it, paid for the whole thing, paid to be on the network, and then boom, that one final fight with forced Griffin and Stefan Bonner and these two crazy fucks are beating the shit out of each other.  It is a wild melee of a fight and the viewership just keeps going up. During the fight, millions and millions of people watched during the fight like tuned in, extra people tuned in because people were calling their friends like, bro, you got to watch this shit. This is nuts.  And this people even know what it was like. What is this? What do they got? Little gloves on. What is happening here?  Before the ultimate fighter, there was fans of UFC or cage fighting or whatever, but they didn't really get to know who Chuck Liddell was. Right. You know, they didn't get to know. Those people with the ultimate fighter was.  Yeah, they got to know these people.  It was a thing that grew. And then you saw this insane fight. It was.  Yeah. Couldn't have played out better. Yeah. I mean, could have played out better.  God damn. They nailed it. And then boom. And that was a great show. He was the guy who did Survivor like he knew how to do those reality shows.  He's a g, he's one of the greats in terms of that genre. That guy knows how to make those fucking shows. That's why it was so good.  You know, it didn't feel like a clunky reality show. It was a fun reality show to watch so that all of the bring it back, by the way, Paulo Costa and Israel Adesanya. Oh, really? Yeah, really.  Holy shit. Tell me I'm going to watch Olympics. I'm going to watch that. That fight is a wild fight, man. Yeah.  You know, because I want to see. Is he a John Jones. Honestly, I do too.  I do too. But is he. Costa has to happen man. When you see what Costa did to Yoel Romero walking down Yoel Romero. Yeah. Who the fuck walks down? Yoel Romero. There's a picture I put up on my Instagram of him head kicking Romero. I mean, just clean. Just clean Chenda the head and you see Romero's crazy skull turn sideways. I'll tell you something that Dana White told me the Youghal had an injury in one of his fights, it's some sort of fractured orbital, some some some of minor fracture of his around the bone, around his eye after the fight.  Yeah, after the fight. During the fight. He got it right after the fight. They sent it to a doctor. The doctor calls UFC.  He goes, where did you find this guy?  And they go, Yeah, he's a stud, right? No, no, no. You don't understand. Like, I've never seen good guys. Like, I've practiced medicine for almost 50 years. He was I've never seen a person who's built like this. He said the tendons in his eyes are three times larger than a normal person's like here it is. That it? Well, that's one of them. He had kicked them several times. But there's one image.  There's an image that I had on my Instagram that it's it's so crazy. It just kept beating my head kicks over and, oh, this is the entire thing, but we just there it is. That was the one that was on my Instagram. We just had kicked him over and over. And look at that. That's the picture. What the fuck, man? The guy just made out of metal and all the guys who fight him say that to, like, look rock.  Look at that. I mean, come on, man. He just Derek Brunson just clanged the skin off of his head like that. Back to the crazy Uriah Hall and then we're going to fight. That's a great fight.  August 22nd, he's he's the most terrifying specimen. So the doctor was saying, like, what is going on with this guy? Like he's built like no person I've ever seen in my life. And so with the UFC he was trying to figure out was Cuba has always had a very aggressive athlete program and they've been involved in all kinds of weird shenanigans and they're tightly connected to the Soviet Union, particularly back then.  And he was on the Cuban Olympic team.  And, you know, Soviet Union has done some really weird shit when it comes to, you know, like experiments on athletes. And you saw the movie Icarus. Right. To see that movie, I don't think so, you need to see that I might have seen it. It's it's about tell me about it. This guy who is he's the guy who made the document.  What is Brian's last name again? The guy who made it pull up the image of it. It's a Netflix. Ikarus. Fogel That's right, sorry, Brian, I smoke too much weed, so he's this is what so what he does what Brian decides to do is film himself competing in an endurance race, a bike race, and then do it the next time next year, juiced up. So he does one year and he does this whole thing and then he gets in.  It's a it's an amazing documentary. Then he gets in touch with this Russian guy who's going to teach him how to do it. And this Russian guy works for the Russian Anti-Doping Agency or whatever they call it over there.  And the Russian guy in the middle of this happening in the middle of doping him up. It turns out that they catch the fact that the Russian team had basically taking in the Sochi Olympics, they've basically taken all of the piss that was to clean the piss that people of the samples, they removed them through a hole in the wall and replaced them with clean piss. So every single athlete had their piss swapped out. And this guy, who's the Russian guy, is explaining this all to this Brian Fogle guy while this is all going down the news, he just stepped in.  Shit. So this is all going down. The news that they caught the Russian the Russian sports, whatever the fuck they are, they figured out these there's micro scratches inside these bottles that indicate that there were these removable unremovable bottles had actually been removed and they figured out how to do some sort of a tool. But the tool left scratches on and they figured this out and they found this hole in the wall like a hole that big. They would I would hand you some dirty piss, you'd hand me some clean piss, I'd replace the piss.  And so they did that with all the athletes. So all the Russian athletes, most likely Jews to the fucking gills. No, no, they did it. The athletes just pissed. But his perspective was it was their job to be on steroids. They all were on steroids. This wasn't like they didn't get to choose. It wasn't like they're cheating. Like the government is making sure you cheat.  They're going to take care of you. Right. It's crazy. Crazy is an amazing documentary.  So what happens when he really he has to go on the witness protection program? So the guy comes to America. Oh, yeah. Everybody smashing. Oh, no, no. He actually got injured a bunch and actually his time sucked. And the second one and I think his battery broke like like something broke on his bike, something fucked up on his bike too, like had some problems and it was supposed to want him doing that well that steroids work.  And instead he proved that we proved that he gets injured. Right. But along the way and he didn't you know, he didn't plan. He planned on doing really good on juice, but he just got fucked up a bunch of times and wound up being hurt and didn't perform that well.  It won the Oscar for Best Documentary Film, and it should have it is amazing.  But once he did it and he starts interacting with his Russian cadeaux, teach them how to do all this stuff.  What is the guy's name? Grigoriev. Yuri. What's his name? Grigoriev, he's got Russian names, Gregory Chingo, oh, there it is.  OK, Grigore, Rod Sankoff, yeah, that is so that's the guy.  And I mean, he basically spills all the beans. So once he realizes like he's on the run, by the way, they take away his family's money, they take away all, they take away their home, they make them homeless. They made his family homeless. He had to leave behind his wife and his his kids like he's fucked, like it's not good. And he's hiding in America. He's probably South Dakota right now, a dive bar with fucking four goons standing over shoulders, looking out for Russians.  I mean, he's fucked. And and he told the whole truth of how they did it, why they did it, the way they've done it always in the past. And it's not a coincidence that Russia, like the amount of gold medalists they got from that one Olympics, was just staggering. And then the Olympic Committee removed them from the next one like they weren't able to compete, like a lot of the sports. They weren't able to compete in the next Olympics.  Yeah, I remember that. Yeah, it's it's crazy.  But he was also detailing how crazy it is that the Olympic Committee and the World Doping Agency, the WADA, WADA, whichever one it was, the test them, they're all like they work for each other, like this guy will go to work for there and that guy will go to work right here.  They're all they're all buddies. We're friends over here. Carl Lewis. He's a good guy. He's a good guy. Get rid of that piss here.  Take my piss. I clean this.  And, you know, that was one of the things they had said about like Lance, you know, like Lance Armstrong getting tested for Tour de France, like, hey, hey, fuckin everybody's on it. You got a dirty sport, man. Like, if you want to take away Lance Armstrong's what is it, a green shirt or something like that, what do you get yellow jersey for being a bad motherfucker on a bike. If you want to give it to the next person in line six, it was like eighteenth place is like twenty six wasn't something fucking astronomical.  Bill Burr had a great bit about it.  It's like our Cycos better than your Saigo, right. That's what it is. You're all a bunch of fucking nuts.  You're all taking drugs like the from Russian, from the Russian perspective, those gold medals were worth it to them to fucking ruin that guy's life for lying about it.  Right. Yes.  Well they want to kill him for sure. They wanted to kill regardless of whatever his name is, the Russian scientist. They wanted to kill him. That's why he's hiding. He's probably gonna have to hide for the rest of his life. I mean, this is just the the life he chose.  Terrifying man. Just really terrifying. But also the same thing that happened in China, the Beijing Olympics.  Chinese, what, like they won so many gold medals, wasn't it like that, like the little tiny gymnastic girls were on juice or something. They all got short. Sure, they were out of the arena. Chicks like to walk on the beam.  You imagine juice it up a little, baby like you're going to do the best backflips. Honey, take a little of this and draw fifty.  Get a big old fuck and we're going to band your feet up or at least lose all your toes to that. You can stand on your toe, but, you know, do they do that?  They had yeah. They used to be a thing like. China would it would take babies with their females and baby or whatever they would like, tie their their feet up really tight to their feet would not grow and they'd be really small. Yeah, but that was just for aesthetics, right. It was like a sign of something.  Yeah. A little feet.  The old women can't walk because their feet are tiny because whatever.  If you ever seen the images of the feet when they bind them, well, you're about to Jamy Chinese foot binding. That's like people do weird shit man.  Like I have friends who have those big ear holes like. OK, shout out to boogie. My friend Richie Martinez, the big got a big ol ear holes.  I had a student at the gym that I'm like, you can't spar with. I can be able to fight like that is like, no, it's cool.  And he would take the big hole and flip it over the top. Oh my God. And I'm like, right, you can spar.  But look, that lady's feet. You look terrible, bro. Look at her toes are tucked under her feet, so her little toe is tucked under and she stands on her toenail and it's dug into a groove in her foot.  Just goes to show you how flexible people are, pliable, like, look at her, there's a standard around what her husband is like. Still too big. Look at that. That's so nasty. Look at her feet, man, go, that's a little juice for her, go back to that other picture of her with her feet up. That's crazy, man. Imagine doing that to yourself. That has to hurt like hell. She's looking down on them.  And they hurt like hell for, you know, years, yeah, right, forever, right? Well, yeah, just to the process. Oh, yeah. To get to that start to get to that. Yeah. Well, that's it's crazy. It's absolutely crazy that they do that. And look at those little tiny shoes that she's wearing. I mean it is absolutely crazy, but it's almost crazier with these to do the heads like an ancient cultures where they would flatten heads out to make them look like aliens and stretch them out.  Everything that while they were alive. Yeah. When they were young, they would take babies and while the children were young. And this is a really freaky thing. When they started finding these skulls, they're like, what are we looking at? Are these aliens? They were trying to figure it out because your skull is a lot more pliable than you think, especially when you're young.  Yeah, baby is really, really soft. So they they've developed this like thing where they would put, like, planks on the side of the kid's head, fucking clamp it down and they would stretch their head out like an ankle.  It's like no ability to have a large skull or no man. I think it's. I don't know what Africa they put like those Goldblatt's weighted rings around its neck and then it looks like their neck is really long, but really they just they compress their shoulders down.  Yeah, they have like and it's super bad for the neck. When you take a shit off your neck, your head is going to fall for sure. That's holding your head up now. Sure.  They probably snore terrible too, right? Yeah. Those rings. You got anything for me? Yeah.  The article said that it's the the reason why they did that was similar to the reason Victorian women would do the waste stuff. It was like a status symbol. So like three inches was the best four feet, four inches was a little better, five inches. And above was like I look at that waste.  That's so gross.  Oh, and there wasn't there another time I think maybe was before this where the big fat was like a sign of nobility or whatever. Yeah. If you're fat you're like a fat chicks. Where were the things that said you had money. Yeah. Yeah.  When I was in Thailand the guys would always wear like white. White powder all over their face, like bleaching powder, because if. If you were to stand and it show that you were like a worker and you worked outside, so everybody would always try to reach their skin white, it's crazy.  Oh, yeah. Oh, that's dark. Mm hmm. Oh, yeah. I know.  I always have like an umbrella that didn't want sun. They're like hiding from the sun all the time.  They want to get to dark nurse Rachel Filipino lady. She was explaining that to us. That's one of the reasons why people like Little Town Glutathione apparently cannot make your skin lighter in some doses.  What else is to go to die on is something that helps you recover from alcohol. It helps your body process alcohol a little bit better. It's got a bunch of functions on the wrong person to ask. It's real good for you.  You want liposomal glutathione. It's the best terms. Like unless you get IV, you can take it as a supplement, but it's good for it actually helps you get over hangovers and shit doesn't completely do it, but it gives you like a little extra boost. So you get like the hotel room Ivy in Vegas, that's what they're giving you. They're giving you glutathione on if you ask for it.  Yeah. You should ask for it if you want to get one of them hotel. I've jammies. Jamie and I get one once a week, right? Yeah. We get I.V. vitamin drip and we get Nadie nad.  Here we go. We think I fucked up that Gregoria gives me fuck of an ad for you. What does it do.  It actually helps keep you younger and also keeps your body performing younger and maybe even lengthens your telomeres. Telomeres which are an indication or an indicator of your age as your telomeres get. As you get older, they get smaller, they get shorter. And this stuff apparently can somehow or another lengthen it and adds to general sets of reactions in the human body. What does entity stand for? What does it say it stands for? Oh, it means something.  It's like short for. So I was like with that picture right there, yeah. It doesn't break down what I know is it for means something has a name, doesn't it? Can you Google? What does that mean? Oh, there it is. Nicotinamide and ninn dy nucleotide was pretty good.  I'm tired, though. Now you write that way better than I.  I used my monkey brain and now I'm tired. Help's turning nutrients and energy is a key player in metabolism and working as a helper molecule for proteins that regulate other cellular functions.  This is like a normal thing that a lot of people have, or this is like a special joergen secret.  So you get it, they sell it, people can get it. It's not cheap, but it's very good for you. Feel great. Yeah. It's just I'm getting old and I'm willing to try anything like 52 and you still like working out, you're like, OK, what do I have to do?  What else you got? What do I have to do?  What's the new do? Yeah, and I'm only willing to do so much because of the like. Well, you've got to drink water. No more alcohol forever.  I'm like hmm. Or or what's the other option. I live less but I enjoy it more.  You drink a little more water and you could drink alcohol. I have a complex life. I need a little booze every now and then. I really do. I need a break. I need a break. I need a break from responsibilities. I need a break from anxiety. I need a break from just thinking from people's opinions, from war, from chaos, from arguments. I mean, it's crazy times right now. If I didn't just smoke a joint, drink a beer right now, let's let it all sink in.  You know, the people that donor. Fascinating. What do you do with all that?  Right.  Yeah, how? You know what I mean. What do you what are you what are you doing? Started getting into.  I've got something here. I've got something here. What do you got there, just this book that I've been reading, it's called Breath. It's by this guy, James Nestore, fascinating shit on the importance of breathing exercises, really fascinating stuff.  Really fascinating breathing exercises. For what? For all sorts of things. Well, you know, it's one of the things that Wim Hof has always said about breathing exercises that you actually can enhance your immune system. And thank you, sir. Regulate your metabolism. This guy's an upcoming guest.  So I just got into it last night, but I'm fucking loving it. Yeah. Would you read about me before I came on? I didn't read that you had a boxing career.  Oh, there you go. I know you like to read books like a five podcast to get there.  I know, right. I knew about your fights pushing for the record.  Are you are you able to fully train right now? Like, what is the rules? Not really, you know, not really my gym, my gym just opened back up. Do you have everybody have to distance is like hit a bag six feet apart from each other?  I think if you probably came in with the measuring tape 90 percent of the time we are within that. My gym is about 7000 square feet and the average class is about 12 people in it.  OK, so you got a nice piece of property there and we have a huge Roll-Up door, so it's almost open air with the fans going and stuff. But we take everybody's temperature before they come in. And, you know, we're not actually sparring or anything like that.  Yeah, a lot of gyms are starting to open up now and just kick boxing or shadow boxing and hitting the bags and things along those lines.  But it's it's been great for me getting back because I was starting to lose it there. I think sometimes, you know, stuck at home, it's. Well, you working out at home? I built like a home gym and I was doing my thing and I was trying to run and stuff. But it's just not it's not the same, you know, and the students are coming back and and. It you don't see how bad they were when they came back mentally, but you see over the course of like a week or two of them working out every day, how much more they open up, how much more normal they seem, how much happier they are, and they start letting the hell out of the bag.  Look, man, I was in a dark spot and it's like I'm going to have an absolute blast. I teach with four classes a day. I'm teaching all the classes right now. And I think that's a lot on that.  That's beautiful. I'm happy to hear that and I'm happy to hear you're able to open again. I think that's awesome.  Aren't shit is no joke, man.  It's no joke. It's a real fucking thing. It's a big part of why people are so angry right now. Right. Because, you know, there's a lot of people out there that, you know, maybe they do spin or maybe they do whatever the fuck they've been doing. They can't do it right now. They can't do any of it.  And there's so many people that are like losing their livelihood. Yeah. You know, I think there's a lot of people that live like corporate life or have normal jobs.  And I'm not talking shit about that, but like, put yourself in someone's shoes that for they invested everything they owned everything they had.  They put in all their work following this American dream. This dream is whatever dream.  And for 14 years, 15 years, they invest everything in and then this weird flu comes along and they can't do their business anymore through no fault of their own, no fault of their own.  And it's like, well, they should have had some money pushed aside or saved aside or whatever. How come these giant these airplane companies that were making billions of dollars for years and years on end, they get a bailout, right? They get the bailout, but a Lolitas fucking whatever?  Well, the dirty secret is if they don't bail out the the airlines, the airlines are not going to employ all those people. And then everyone's fucked even further. So they look at that like this is something we need because we need it for business. We need for people to be able to travel around. We need these planes run and we're not going to able to do it ourselves. But the dirty secret is there's not enough money to fix everything.  It's not enough money to pay all the people, all the money that we're making during the time off.  And then my my shout out to my boy John Thomas and Ohio, my buddy I went to high school with back in Ohio. Here's a couple pizzerias and I think they're OK. They're allowed to open back up now. But his employees, a lot of his employees are coming back to work because they make more money on unemployment they ever did before.  They have an excuse if they make more money on unemployment than they were actually earning working there. And they don't have to go back to work because they could say they're scared of covid Fox. Listen, I get it. If I was one of those dudes, I'd be like, hey, man, I want to die from cooking pizza, bitch. I get it. Yeah, for sure.  I don't want to get rid of you, especially if you're a fat guy and you're like, I just hang out at home, play call of duty and get paid more or risk my life to make pizza.  I suck at it so this can't wrap my brain around people still buying into all this shit is the fucking flu. People die of the flu every year. A lot of them die.  The friend, our friend, if Edwards was sick as fuck, was sick for like weeks at a time in and out of the hospital. This is back in like December Nagy. They're tell me that covid-19 was here before that or it's the flu. But now when he get. Now it's now it's over 19, but then it was the flu. Well, the first test is antibodies that they test. That's how they find out they do an antibody test and then they say, oh, you did have covid-19.  But look at a buddy of mine who came in here who's fucking convinced. He's like, I know I had it. I was so sick.  Nothing. Nothing. He was like, what? Oh, maybe a bad test is the other one.  Did you see the man got him on this? Could be did you see the guy and Tanzania like the president of Tanzania? No. What did he do?  Oh, it's so good that. Well, it's probably too late. He's like the president of Tanzania and like Africa. Right. And it's got like super thick accent. And he said, you know, something's going on here. People, they sent us to cover the covid tests and we tested we took we could take tests or however many tests. And I took the dragonfruit and we tested the inside of the dragonfruit and we wrote Charles whatever. And we tested it off and it was inconclusive.  And we took a goat and I tested the goat and I wrote his name was Sandra, and she's 30 years old and works whatever. We tested her and she was positive. And then I did another one with the chicken and it came back positive and did another one with the whatever.  He tested all this random stupid shit and got like positive, positive, inconclusive.  Well, inconclusive makes sense if you test him. Fruit and positive might make sense if it's really contagious to animals. If you're in an area that has a high concentration of people that have the disease or, you know, you just think it's just totally unscratched, take it. There's no way guys stop buying bullshit.  So you just launch it. You just think it's what do you think those people are dying of? This is another cold.  I think it's a real bad flu and it's flu season. People are getting sick, but you know that. But covid-19, the thing is a real thing. I know it's a risk. OK, I know that, you know, these people are dying in a way that's not consistent with dying from the flu. Right. But some of them are dying real weird ways. Yeah. Yeah.  Maybe it's real. It's real. I'm not sure I know what you're saying. It's real. You're fucking around in a little bit of a way. I'm a little bit fucking around it.  I'm a little bit, but a little bit like this is not that much different from the flu that we should have killed our society.  We killed the world's whole economy. Yeah. The fucking whole world over a thing that killed that that kills less than one percent of people.  Right. And how do we get it back? How do we get the world back? How do we get it back to normal? No one knows. There's no roadmap. No one. No one, no clue. And here's the thing, though. This is one thing in support of, like those hard core business folks, like they're the ones who want this shit back to normal more than anybody. Right? They're in deep shit right now. That's why the economy is still doing so well.  That shows you how bullshit the economy is. The stock market is doing great. The stock, the stock market these days with the stock market's up. Mike, how? Well, show me your math. How is your stock market up so much?  Fuck are you going on? And then it's like we're supposed to trust the who, right? And the who says one thing.  And then the next day it's called the World Health Organization because the who is awesome. All right. You know. Oh, you whoo hoo hoo hoo. Come on, man, I'm a child of the 80s, the who is the way they were kings, the World Health Organization Falchi.  Yeah, those people.  Well, the saddest one was when he said that the only reason he told people not to wear masks is because we didn't have any one.  Really. How about the time he told them within like a week later or a week after or before they were like, oh, well, you know, Mass don't actually work, but it just shows solidarity.  And it's a sign that we should do this. And I'm like, what? And then the other chick does 90 percent of her.  Half of all positive tests are false positives, dude. So this is normal. Like, it's so much fuck are you going on so much thuggery but so much fuck.  It's also they're learning on the job, you know, they're trying to figure out what this thing is and isn't on the job. And they can't just be honest, you know, and say, you know, we made mistakes. This is what we thought.  You know, now we think differently. But people died. Sorry.  You know, they can't say that people died in nursing homes, that our government made them take sick people whether to go or whatever, like government.  New York, New York. That's that's a dark choice, man. And then Como's brother is on CNN like a block of myself in my basement. Fifteen days to get clean. Come on. Your whole family, bro.  Well, not only did he get caught, but he also did a video of him coming out of the basement for the first. Yeah, that was the worst thing.  And getting caught. That was like that you planted and made this fake scenario and your your family's supposed to be all shocked when you come out of the basement for the first time in fourteen days.  That's I agree with you. Fuck off. That said, I've worked in television and I guarantee you that was a producer's decision. That was some network executive that wanted a video of him coming out and they had already got it planned and he just fucking jetted over to the Hamptons, check out a spot, was going to build his dope house and then came back and was like, OK, we're doing it.  I'm coming out of the basement. Everybody go. I got in a fight with a guy on a bike and said, OK, still don't call me straight out. And so he goes up the stairs, like, here I am. Look at this. I made it out of the basement. I feel for him in that situation.  I feel for him because I guarantee you that was some jackass from the network that had this idea to have him come out of the basement and some serious theatrical thing.  You were just deceitful or sneaky or whatever word it is to all of the viewers on TV. I don't feel bad for him. You intentionally just tricked everybody on some fake shit.  They didn't have to do that. They didn't have to do that. Well, that's why podcast work, because nobody's doing that kind of shit on podcasts. You know, they realize you don't have to you don't have to pretend to say, yeah, I went to the Hamptons, probably. Shouldn't I stay away from everybody? My wife's already around me anyway. And then some dude in the boat came by and he's being a dick. But I was like, Yeah, bro, just looking at my house spot, I'm building a dope house.  You bike riding dick.  Fuck, if I survive this big covid shit, I'm going to fucking live right next door to you. He was you know, he was an interesting case, too.  Apparently he was saying at nighttime it gets really bad when he's on television. You look great, like, yep, it's bad at night.  OK, how about you go to bed earlier?  We don't really have it, but, you know, are you taking vitamins? How come nobody said that? Right.  Well, how come that. No, nobody we closed down gyms. Nobody has talked about food, about immune system. None of that that Dr. Shivah guy was seeing a lot of cool stuff. But nobody's saying it's must be something we're going on there. I don't know.  Yeah, he's a weird one. I don't know if he's telling the truth or what the deal is. Sort of like some of the stuff that would makes sense. And then it was like, you're obviously running for some office or whatever.  Very smart, that's for sure. Smart, very intelligent guy.  But, you know, he's if you're a person that questions any aspect of covid, you're immediately pushed into this area of someone who can't be trusted, can't listen to them. You got to silence the conspiracy theory. I want them to. They were saying that about Elon. They were like the Elon podcast never trended. And which is I'm not asking I don't give a fuck if it trends. If it doesn't, I appreciate YouTube. I appreciate this platform.  I really do. I really do. But I think when something gets 11 million downloads in a day and there's a bunch of other videos that don't get nearly as much, but that one's not trending like why isn't it trending and how much that has to do with his opinions on things that aren't sanctioned. And one of his opinions on things was the the perspective on covid that keeping people locked up as a mandatory thing, that is not good. It's not what this country was founded on.  And we should quarantine people who are sick. And he's smart as fuck. And he made a lot of sense. And people don't want to hear that because they want to hear Foushee tell you wear a mask or don't wear a mask or I mean, these people these these people are health experts, but we've proven that they've been wrong about multiple.  All things just in the two months they have been wrong and they have proven that they've been wrong and multiple things continuously right.  But if you have a video with Foushee and it gets 11 million views, that motherfucker will trend guarantee, I guarantee you.  You can't do that. You shouldn't do that. I shouldn't say you can't do that because you obviously can and you did, but you shouldn't do that because it's not good. The best way to figure out who's right when someone who especially in retrospect, you know, hindsight is 20/20. But we're looking back three months and all the times the things are wrong, all the mistakes that were made. In January, the World Health Organization literally said it can't be transmitted from person to person, according to China.  That's what they literally said. They put it out in a tweet. OK, give them that. Doesn't everybody made mistakes. But because of that, you can't silence people who have contrary opinions, because the fact that you have all these people that are experts in their field that have made mistakes, you cannot discount someone who's clearly a fucking super genius, who's also looking at this from an additional perspective. Here's another perspective. Here's why don't we just quarantine the people that are at risk?  Why don't we quarantine people who are overweight quadrant instead of the whole population? Then step two, let's figure out what the fuck this is and how to take care of it and take care of everybody, but give people the opportunity if they choose to take a risk to take the risk. You can't force them to tank their business.  I mean, maybe that hindsight's 20, 20, but that sounds like a logical thing that should have been said from the jump. Why do why do we have to make that? This is one mistake.  This is why. Because we thought it was going to be way worse. We thought it was going to be worse than it is. We thought it was going to burn through the population and kill 10 percent of everyone. Sometimes those things happen and sometimes they they morph, right. They evolve. Viruses can change. They can they can change as they're going from person to person. And they really believe that the virus that we got on the West Coast here is actually lighter than the virus they got on the East Coast.  They think the virus that came from Europe is probably more deadly than the virus that came here. Why? I don't know. But there's a bunch of the fact is that they never take into consideration. You never hear people talking about vitamin D, going outside, taking care of yourself. Those people on the other side, man, those people in the West Coast or East Coast, rather, they don't get any sun. Do you ever live in New York, bro, been there, though, but, yeah, I guess it gets dreary there, just like right on top of each other.  Every single subway, everything about the subway rail when you walk up the stairs.  Oh, gross. And also in those subways, it's everybody's breathing, everybody else's. There is no way around it. You have to breathe their air. But the big thing, like, you know, I live in in Boston. I lived in Newton when I was a kid. And I remember Newton was a nice place, beautiful, beautiful neighborhood. But I remember the wintertime was so depressing. Just look up at the sky and it was just grey.  You couldn't see anything. You couldn't see any sun. I mean, the sun came through the clouds, but you never saw blue sky like for months at a time. It was just gray and everybody would get bummed out and people get real shitty with each other.  Do you notice, like, when the quarantine first happened, like the first two weeks, it was just raining all day. Every day my backyard was flooding. It was terrible and it was life is awful.  And then all of a sudden the sun came out as a couple of days off to beheader.  Yeah, yeah. Having a day off and it's raining sucks. Awful. Yeah, awful.  But but not that bad for us because at least we can say all we need this rain. This is a good rest day. We need this rain. We're in a drought right now. It's real bad.  But if you live in Seattle every day, every day. Seattle, I love you people. You guys are beautiful. I love your attitude. I don't like the Chad situation. I don't think that's wise.  But what's your thoughts on jazz?  I just want to tell the people. Seattle, get out, go, just go. There's a reason why it's going crazy.  It's filled with homeless people. Everyone's tired, depressed. You don't get any sunlight. It's not good. You need sunlight. That's just terrible for you. My take on the Chad situation is they're doing exact. I was talking about it with calling on Nawaat the other day. They're doing exactly the same thing. They get mad at when they think about a country, they put up walls, they have borders, they have policing enforcement. They beat the fuck out of people.  There's been murders inside. It's not all Kumbaya. You know, it's like you just made a shittier, smaller version of a city.  Of course you did. Of course she did.  But it's got borders, a regular city. You can just drive in Albuquerque. They let you in jazz. It's like, fuck you. We have border walls. You can go right. You no one could come in here every year.  That's crazy is how did that happen? They're laughing. How did that happen? It's like a real pleasure. It's what it is for sure.  Yeah. I mean, that's what it is.  And they took over the city, they said over the last years, well, they need to learn, you know. I mean, there's there's a thing that happens when a lot of these protesters get equated with progress. Right.  Whether it's antifa or any like, you know, real Marxist left wing progressive socialist movement. They have good intentions. Right. And they get lumped in with the idea of progress. So people let them get away with stuff. They think, oh, just they're just it's progress. It's going to work out. It's going to work out. But they don't have a real plan. These folks don't have a long term plan. When Seattle gave them that just back as part of the most brilliant move ever, like, OK, oh, you think you could do better once you go ahead.  It's like you have kids, right? When you kids are going to want to join my shoes, like, OK, Cretaceous. You stand there for a minute. You want some help, I'll help you because you don't know how to tie your shoes. This idea you make the bunny ears, you go to the loop, but sometimes you have to let a kid, I bet, particularly boys. I have all girls, but I would imagine with boys even more so they get a little stubborn focused on them doing that.  And you got to go.  Oh, OK. Do you. OK, Chaz, good luck. Good luck. OK. Six blocks because it two murders inside of a fucking week.  I just don't understand how that happened. I don't understand the city. Just let it go. I think it's like a publicity stunt they want and I think the city or they lost charge of that does a lot of them out letting them do that.  But they're not being overrun with like guns and bombs and. Well, bullshit.  This is like we're going to let these guys have it and then we're going to, you know, let this fear like I don't even know it. It doesn't make any sense to me.  It seems like a joke if you talk to my friend Rob Wolf reached out to me because some folks from the Seattle Police Department reached out to him to try to get their message out. They're trying to figure it out. And essentially they were saying that the media is not telling the true story and that the true story is every time, like the media will show them tear gassing people, they don't say that they had set up boundaries and they said, you got to stay out of the precinct, got to stay out of this area.  You guys, you can't just invade. And every time they put up these boundaries, they would push through and then they had to use tear gas. They fell to defend their position. And then they eventually had to give up the whole precinct and then they had to give up like six blocks. And they don't feel like there's a lot of support for their position in the news. And they also don't feel like they're they're being given the freedom to defend it properly, like they really they couldn't they had to get out of there.  That's why they took that's why those people took it. That's why it's still locked down today in. The mayor's been saying lately it's time to go home now. But the mayor before gave a furtive answer of it, like saying that peaceful protest has always been great. Maybe this is the summer love, like, oh, OK, good luck, lady. Like these ideas, they get connected with progress, right? So those people who really want better.  Right. They're angry that George Foy got murdered. But we all are. Every normal, rational person is angry. They all want to fucking see change, but we all do. But they decided to see change. And six blocks of Seattle, that had nothing to do with George Floyd. They just took over and they took over these buildings. So they basically did what Columbus did. They came and took over an area, but they then they did what Trump did.  They put up a wall and then they did what those cops did. They beat the fuck out of people. Yeah. I mean, they they ruined their own idea within a couple of weeks. So it really was like Seattle just gonna go ahead. Oh, you know how to do better. Yeah, well, you got to do better. OK, go ahead.  Go ahead. And now the like. It's time to go home. But there's you know, there's people in there that are armed. It's not that simple.  You know, I don't know how they think they're going to get these people out of there because you can't even get homeless people out of San Francisco. They've basically taken over Portland, Portland filled with tents. San Francisco's nuts, man, it's nuts. You drive down the street in some neighborhoods in San Francisco, you see like multimillion dollar houses and there's five tents in front of the house. And like, what is this?  What is you can't litter. You can't throw beer cans on the ground. How come you can leave a tent and a fucking little camp stove and a cardboard box filled with bullshit and everybody's just waiting for somebody else to come clean the tent out in front of their yard?  Everybody's waiting. Officials, what would you do if there was three tents in front of your house? It's a good question. I don't know what to do. I don't want to go to jail. I don't want to go to jail. So I don't know, probably hire somebody to clean it up.  I don't know what to do. I wouldn't know what to do. What are the what is the law? Can my kid not play in the yard because someone threw a fucking heroin needle in the yard and he's got a tent right there. And if you're in Venice and you have this little little tiny patch of grass where your kid can play and your kid runs into a heroin needle, someone chucked over the fence. But we have to be progressive. We have to be nice and people.  Will you go knock on the tent? Hey, man, you can't have your tent here. Get the fuck out.  Oh, fuck it, dude. Oh, I actually won't. You're going to get the fuck out here. You got to go. I'm a crack baby.  All right. Later. You got to go.  I'm looking at that about leaving. Said they're going to leave today.  There's like an official capital food protest says there it's concluded as of tonight and they expect some people to not actually leave, but they're saying it's over.  See, I think somebody else funded that. I think that was a big joke. I think that was the thing. Funny. I don't know, probably somebody in the deep state or whatever. The guys that fund all the other stuff that goes crazy. Right? The guys who throw Eppstein witnesses at a building site, how does that money go around?  Who gets it? It goes in Bitcoin. They buy tacos with it. Oh, yeah.  I think people are funding and oh, there's so much shit going on. I can't just blindly believe any of these narratives anymore.  It's just beyond to me, it would be crazy if we found out there was some sort of a weird ulterior motive for letting them take over. And this is all been planned out in some sort of strange.  People think there's some people think that this civil unrest and that even encouraging the spread of Corona would, you know, by letting people protest and not doing anything to stop it is actually some sort of a nefarious attempt to make sure that all the elections are mail in ballots so they can monkey with them, you know, you know, shenanigans.  It does make sense. If I was writing a Tom Clancy novel. Yeah, right. That makes sense.  I don't know if it's true, though, too. I can barely pay attention to shit. I do. Yeah. My left switch kicks. Terrible. So really. Yeah. So much. I got you bro. Moves to squats.  You see too much of a weird come off bounce. I'm concentrating on that. I can't concentrate on Chaz.  I like to step up over the switch. We can work. I'll tell you what, I'll show you that you to step over the switch.  OK, ok.  Because if we do the switch, you're staring at me every time I'm staring at you or about the clock or whatever, and then you see me jump and switch my feet.  Right.  You know, that's something, you know, it's coming. But just step forward of my right foot. I tried to back up. I can make the adjustment because my foot is stepping.  OK, that makes sense. That makes sense. Kevin Ross does the one switch.  Well, once I jump to switch, I'm stuck in that position. I have taken an additional step, a few back up. But if I just walk forward and you move backwards, I can adjust my foot.  Some guys don't like to switch, right? Some guys just blast it right from the front leg, having to do that as well.  It just depends on the distance the person's coming to me. Then I can do that. Right.  And if they're moving away in a way that I just don't make sense. What do you think about the low calf kick? How crazy is that?  What's become so popular thing? And then all of a sudden it's a thing. It's like the best thing. It's like a really effective thing. My my training partner Bumba, we were both had a both of our last fights were on the same cart and that was like his thing. He was like I'm going to kick him in the calf, going to kick him in the calf, in the kingdom, in the calf. And then he kicked me in the calf over aspiring and I'm like Abreau.  I fucking don't do that like don't do that like stop doing that, you know, my fucking shit. He could ruin your shit. Yeah. It's not like I kick where you like catch a medium one and you're OK.  If somebody really slams into your calf you're fucked and if you it happens by just being lazy with your block.  If you block correctly it's fine. But if I especially like a sparring situation, you just it leaves you with your block and then it hits that side of that calf and it's a different ballgame.  It fucks it up for a long time to the nerve. It's a weird feeling, right? Yeah. Sucks.  It's like well it's all like the Michael Chandler one where it went numb. That was insane. Henry Cejudo versus Mighty Mouse to same thing. The second fight. Same thing. Yeah. It shuts your foot off. It's nuts. And there's not much you can do about that. He's a beast, dude, he's up there to undeniable. He's up there. I want to talk about some of the greats. The guys are Olympic gold medals and wrestling and then to division UFC world champion and then smashed Dominic Cruz smashed TJ.  Delysia smashed Marlin. Marisa juiced up to Zozo episode.  But yet but starving to death really is just keeping them alive.  Bro, he looked worse on Weigend Day than anyone I've ever seen ever next to Travis Luder. But Travis Luder was just trying to dehydrate too much in one day TJ had he had eaten himself down to nothing and then dehydrated and then dehydrated himself, he had eaten himself down to nothing like he let his body eat itself. His cheeks were completely sunken in. He looked like he was like he was found in the woods like he was thirty five.  Twenty five. Twenty five. Twenty five. Yeah. So he was the thirty five pound champion. Went down to twenty five. He said he took EPO just to be able to train. He was like he couldn't do anything but the you know it's hard to tell the alpha male guys like fuck you, you did like Cody Gerbrandt in a press conference for saying, bro, you were always taking that shit.  So he didn't say it's like it's one of those things where it's like when you get caught with something like that, your whole legacy gets it's gets thrown up in the air. People your. I mean, I wonder if they could retroactively test some of the samples. If they kept the samples as long I don't know if I don't know how long they keep, that's how they got Lance, right, was never popped while he was competing and was after the fact.  Right.  So my that no Northanger got him. I think he had to confess where they don't believe they ever caught Lance.  I thought they took old samples and then did it, but maybe they didn't do much.  Right. I don't know. You might be right. I felt like at the time when he quit, though. That wasn't the case all the time when it was like he was the walls are closing in on them and he had teammates testify everybody was going out.  Yeah, crazy. But again. It's just when your whole sports dirty, like, what are they doing now, are they just remarkably slower? Like, what are they doing? You got a juiced up sport. If you keep the same time, I'm going to be super suspicious. Yeah.  What happened in that? Very next. The very first of the next guy behind Lance that didn't juice was twenty seven or something.  The numbers just tack on an hour to every race.  I know. I thought it was 18th but you might be right but it's something crazy like that's definitely top ten are gone.  Oh for sure. Top 15 who agree it's over top. Yeah. Well that's the old days of the UFC, too. Mm hmm.  I mean, you want to go back to the old days of pride for sure.  Inson anyway told me they told him on the contract you will not be tested for steroids.  He said it was all lies told to me that the same thing like it was on big, bold letters, they could wind up with big, bold letters, the like. How about it, boys?  So could you want to say so? Could you? I could be wrong. One of those guys told me that after they got tested and pride they would walk out if they got tested, that they would be just cups of piss all down the hallway after the fight like they did. They didn't do anything with it. Like the guys pee in the cup and they sat on the floor and then the hallway was just cups of pee all the way down.  The penis cup, please. It's required. OK, thanks. Yeah, we got nothing. Yeah, we tested for drugs man. That turns out tested their piss. It is is burn the results clean as a whistle when you go and watch those, some of those fights where guys were just like so juiced up they let Bob Sapp fight it.  Three hundred seventy five pounds with abs, with abs bro. That guy.  And then and he's like an emotional wreck starts crying.  Well when you're on that kind of juice I would imagine your whole perspective on reality just kids like throw it. It's kind of doses.  Are those just buckets of testosterone in there?  I would like to ask. I want it to be clean. It would tell you, you know, like what what what were you doing during the Minitel fight? Tell me about those days. Tell me about what what what what was going on.  Kirkup and his legs were just fucking enormous.  Meanwhile, cockup smashed him even when he was like fully on the shit from cockup dropped him. Guys were on the shit.  Yeah, that's for sure.  Yeah. Well, that was the thing. People got real mad at me when I questioned Faida. I'm like, wow, listen, it's not like Russia hasn't been known to do shit like that before. When it's in your contract that you're not testing and you're the goat heavyweight, you're the goat.  Sometimes he comes up to me done so much to go anymore.  Yeah. Not, not so much the goat anymore. Once they were testing. Right. Vandelay but also also years on the clock. There's a lot of factors here.  Of course, you know, when like when he was fighting like broke up the early days of like Phaedo versus Kroko, it's hard to argue that he wasn't a goat. He's one of those guys, like in the heavyweight division. There was a few years when random and picked him up and slammed them. And then he kamora them right afterwards and saying, yeah, there was a there are some fights, man, when you like, that guy's the best.  He's the fun, spirited, terrifying dude. Oh my God. I jumping up and down the cross. Oh my God. Imagine like what the fuck.  This dude's a gorilla. He had so much athleticism. He was so fast and so powerful. He knocked out Crack-Up.  Remember that he stepped in, faked like a takedown of the left hook boom. And it finished him off on the ground with nasty Hammerfest. It was horrible.  I mean, that's like this the kickboxer transitioning to him and his biggest problem, right?  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Yep. There's been a quite a few of those and random.  And it was like he was so perfect for that role because he was the wrestler who was a stud wrestler but also had crazy speed and power with punches, crazy closing the distance power. You know, like wordly. Exactly.  Go like the wordly Jiron fight like those like Carlos Condee or the Wordly and Robilliard.  Oh yeah.  Perfect example is his ability to close distance to hit the target is second to none.  Oh my God. Yeah, he would throw bombs man. What a fucking career that guy had has had. But how good is Gilbert Burns? Look, man, that was crazy about a big fan experience.  He's a stud. Everybody, before the fight, I was like, man, I really like Willie, but I think, I think over birds and everybody's like, that will be for sure. Willie, for sure.  If you see the Gilbert Burns that knocked out Damian Miah and you realize like, man, this guy is no joke on the ground, Brazilian jiu jitsu world champion, he's got that sneaky left hook. And also like this is a giant opportunity for him. Woodley's an all time great if wordly retires right now, he goes down the books, won the all time great UFC champions are definitely top three welterweights of all time or top four plus.  There's a big difference. And a former champion and an up and coming guy that's starting to see the light that there is a fucking title, right. There I could get to this, you know, like it being in those positions and that dude's a dangerous, dangerous dude when when they haven't gotten there yet.  This is a guy that's is still trying to keep it, you know. Yes. Yes. And then that's burned that team, Sanford, Invermay, with Theory of the killing, a jujitsu monster phenom.  And he's working with high level strikers every day.  What's crazy is like on a on a kill streak.  Oh, man, he's such an Quilcene. What's crazy is, like, he really didn't strike until just a few years ago. I mean, I don't know how many years he's been fighting now, but before that, like, just had to learn how striking he was a jujitsu guy. He doesn't have like a background in kickboxing. But when you watch him fight, he's all about striking.  Really good. Really good. Really good to have drop wordly like that in the first round and swarm him like fuck man. And his pace keeps up that pace for five fucking rounds hard within like between UFC fights he's doing grappling.  They're still competing and grappling and stuff like.  That's a dangerous move, Matt. That's a dangerous move when Cubs' wants and blew his knee out at the quintet. I was like, oh no. And against Jake Shields, I'm like, Hey dude, Jake Shields is huge. He's a lot bigger than you, man.  Yeah. And he got you see it. They were. I didn't see it. Is it a leg lock position? I think it was like ripping and that's terrible. They were stuck in his bad position and Cubs' knee exploded. Yeah, it was it's just a bad grappling match up.  I mean, I know Cubs' a black belt in Brazilian jitsu, but Jake is big, he's a big guy and he's fuckin strong and he has a long career as a competitive jujitsu player.  If you're KUB and you're like just doing real good, like you've got some wicked fights and you got a lot of momentum, and then you blow your fucking knee out in this grappling competition like shit. And he's like thirty five, I think in that range. That's a bad time to get injured like that.  And if you look at it like I'm a fighter and I'm doing this grappling tournament as like a thing, a fun thing stuff, I think then you have to go in there. Like if I have caught in a position and this is not going well, I have to know that I'm a fighter, you know.  Yes. You got to be willing to tap or at the end of the day, you're just like, what the fuck? Yeah, fuck what I do that.  Yeah, there was a it was a lot of jujitsu, guys. In that thing, there's there's something about those leg locks, too, it's like a scary way to get hurt because like, yikes, that's going to be a bad one. You know, when you see someone get hooked and then not tap in quick enough and you see that look in their face like, are you like, oh, yeah. Recovering from that one for a long time.  Everybody's like training, training leg looks now. Right. That's like a new, newer thing, right.  Yeah. I've been training about Eddie eventually and it's like getting used to just the Tim Planet style of jujitsu is so different. And then like the the lockdown every five seconds on my leg, I had to deal with that. And they had everybody constantly going for leg locks all the time. I've never I've trained a lot of teams and a lot of ways over the years with jujitsu. And it's just it's a real issue.  It's a really it's a real issue because it's not like a lot of room for defense in certain spots. Right. He'll hook spots like E like inside Hilux. Bro, you got very little time to make a decision there. Where are you going to roll out of this or are you just going to tap now, preserve your shit because you might get ripped apart then Eddie's warmups.  We have to like you, I'm sure, you know, like the A's and B's C's.  There's like I think it was C that we were doing. Maybe it was B, but it was like ne misbah ankle lock, never like foot.  But but these things that's just the warm up of the thing. These guys are constantly working on specific, you know, style of jujitsu around the leg locks. Yes. Locks and magalog. It's a crazy time, you know.  And if you look at the professional jujitsu scene, if you look at the top of the food chain like the Gordon Ryans and Craig Jones and the guys that nature, they're all known for having nasty legs on a horse. Yeah, well, Craig is an Australian guy, but yeah, Gaudron Gary Tonin, who's now a one F.C. guy. So he made his debut? Yeah, several times I saw several times he's undefeated and I'm awesome. Yeah, he's doing really good.  It is a big deal because, you know, whenever a guy like you who's a world champion kickboxing or a guy like him is a world champion, grappling makes its way into May like your advantage. The advantage of your specialty is significant, right? Like when you're standing up at someone you're advantage for most guys against you is pretty significant. You know, if you were just having a kickboxing fight to be very significant. So that's the same thing with grappling with a guy like Tonin men.  Hey, guys, hold your shit. You got real problems, man. He's sneaky. Quick. You ever see that video where it was?  I think it was in Abu Dhabi where he hit this dude with a scissor sweep right into a heel hook and like, tapped him in 15 was like immediate.  He just threw his body weight sideways and fell right into the heel hook and was immediately cranking on it.  And and I feel like he has a couple of those. And like, this is his forte. Well, he's so good defensively. This is not it. But this is similar. He did it on this guy, too. That's that's in just a grappling competition. I think he's done it in Miami as well. But he's so good defensively that he's not really worried, like about you catching him when you go to the ground.  So he'll do wild shit to get the ground, like dive into a flying Cizre, you know, because he's like, look, once we go to the ground, my level is so high in comparison to most guys.  I could just get away with getting to the ground and weird spots. You know, the confidence, even if I get yeah.  Even if I get in a weird spot, I'm going to still end up in a better position.  Yeah, this is right here. Look at this boom. I mean, come on man. As do tries to rise like the top top.  I mean that is nasty man. He falls right into it.  Right into it. Bam I yeah. That feeling of feeling your shit separate inside your knee like oh god I'm so quick, it's so quick like you do I even bother trying to figure out what is you know, get the fuck off.  Get off me. That's stop, stop, stop. And some guys would just let them rip their knee apart. There was a Gary Tonin. AJ, how do you say his last name? I guess I guess I am. I am. Who's also very talented.  And Gary Tonin had him in the craziest knee bar where his knee was just fucked, just bent completely out of place. And he and he just let him fuck his knee up. It's nasty to watch, too.  And then he's out for over a year or so that he was out for that long, believe it or not. Yeah, I think he just dealt with the fact that his shit was ripped up and he had a shout out to him.  He had a wild Belcher fire.  Well, that's where it was. First one was like fucking everybody was ragging on him. He really wants his stupid faces. Didn't work out little bit like his last, but they give him, like, a tough guy that was part of that tournament. And, man, he really he really brought it. It was good. He really brought it.  It was an awesome fight. Really good. He's super talented on the ground. Really good. And again, in comparison, like he can hang in there with guys like Tonin in comparison to the average enemy fighters can have a significant advantage for sure. See if you can fight. Find that Gary Tonin taps out.  His name is again, his name is tough to say. There it is. So look, look how bad Disney is, dude, look at that. That is so bad. That is so bad. Look how far back that's going.  Hmm. And arm just handles it just deals. I don't give a fuck. Go ahead, break my shit. Like he's literally letting him fuck his knee.  Look how bad it was to see that one more time. Look how bad that thing is bent. Look at that, bro. That's bad. That's really how far it is passed straight out. And look how Red Gary's faces. Holy shit. Gary's trying to murder everyone he's ever met.  Oh, like that, huh? Yeah, exactly, exactly, it's bending the wrong way. Yeah, yeah, but I must confess, I know because it seems like it should be he should be facing the other direction.  It's bending backwards, posting off of his own shit, trying to get more off of that like I've read his face. Is he's going for that.  Yeah, that is he's his knee is getting ripped apart there and his head is going this way. This foot is going that way. Not good. Superduper not good. And he's like, fine, if I can find this, this adds up fine. Some people are just tough, man. They can handle getting their leg ripped apart. I've seen it. John Jones did it against Veter. Feet are ruined, his arm ruined. His veto got him in a full on arm bar, fully hyperextended.  And John's like, fuck you, I'm not tappin. Like, you do whatever you want with that thing.  I got this one over here. The Tim Sylvia get his arm snapped in half. Yes. Frank Mia Farrow.  And then the only person that saved his entire fucking career was Herb Dean. Right. Herb dude's like, hey, hey, hey. Your arms broken.  Come on, bro. Yeah. It's like, let me fight. And, you know, you were you commentated that.  Yeah. Yeah. And you were like, oh, something's going on here. They're like they're watch the video.  You're like, oh well the audience is booing. And so I said, you got to show these people the video. We've got to see this video. And, you know, the audience is booing and then they put it up on the big screen.  And then when they put it up on the big screen, the moment you see it snap, you, oh, here it through the whole crowd like, oh, it was the worst broken arm I've ever seen.  Up to that point.  Someone else had a nasty one in the scene I can't think of. It was like a sports spiral fracture, Tal versus Frank there. Frank Miller got them in the camera. Militar didn't tap and he just. You heard it, too. You heard it packed arena.  You hear him and you see him sitting there looking at it like, oh, yeah, look at him. Look at him looking at like, fuck.  Have you ever hit somebody with that Antwaun? They're shit. No, I did when I was a long time ago. But I was I had somebody in a camera and they were like an upper belt. And I just didn't think that we could get them, thought it was whatever. And I don't even know if it was like about me. He was just not going with the camera sweep.  I might even be bittersweet. OK, I just refused the sweep and his joint ripped.  And it sounded like if you took a look at terrycloth towel I just pulled it apart is just terrible. Oh. And that gave me like nightmares for like weeks is always in my head because it's right over you.  Right. It's like right in your ear.  Oh, terrible.  Feel the tendons ripping apart terrible things that sound like that, right? Yeah. That's the rough thing about jujitsu, man. If you break something you're like, well, now I'm out for six months if I'm lucky.  Yeah. And the ego gets involved.  Right. Yeah. There was a lot of ego in jujitsu. Oh for sure, man. You know, let it go. I always try to go into like especially when I get home, I go to a lot of different jujitsu gyms.  I'm not like a long term guy. Right. So it's like, oh, that's just chilling.  And like, I go in with no ego and there's always a guy that's gotta to go. Like extra supermarkets is big, his big moment, you know, and it's.  Yeah, that is a problem.  These motherfuckers in their big moments like brother those your big Dave. It's just like my Tuesday afternoon. But that is the problem with a professional fighter always training with civilians. You never you never know you not vetting these people like they might be bad cops.  Like, you know, bad cops are a lot of trained jujitsu to if you're in a fucking blaze and there's a guy who has that bad cop mentality and he happens to be a brown belt, bro, I was so scared to get pulled over.  No, let's just do whatever you want. You want good cops. That's what good cops. Cops are important.  And I know there's a lot of them. I think there's more good cops and bad. I really believe that. I think it's just insanely hard job. And I think they're held to a standard that they should be held to because it's it's a life or death situation. But it's a standard where your entire job is. You're dealing with conflict.  Conflict is very rare for people, right? For regular people. Not like you. You fight. You know, you're pretty good at conflict. Right.  But for regular folks, they don't come into physical conflict on a regular basis. It's very rare for a cop. It's every day that's you're overloading your system. So if you have this guy who's already a little wacky and then you put him into a everyday conflict situation and then he's got seven years on the job, who knows how nuts that guy is by the time he does something stupid, which is why we just need to start the process with are you OK with conflict?  You know, let's go down the list.  Don't even ask him. You can't ask them. You've got to make him carry the boat. I think they should all go through buds training.  I really do have any any kind of thing. Yeah. Find out if they're exceptional. Find out if there's something. There's something about them. It separates them from a regular person, Wolf, not well, guess what, having a gun and a fucking badge, the ability to pull somebody over and tell them what to do and shoot people, that takes you out of the realm of a normal person. If you want to be a non normal person, you have to show the qualifications of a non normal person.  And I think most of them can do it. They could do it. And if they listen to JoCo, they let JoCo willing take over the training and just make sure everybody does 20 percent training.  We can radically reduce a lot of the interactions of people that are negative and then we can over overshadow it with good stories of cops doing good things to change the perspective. Yes, well, right now everybody needs to see there's a problem so they can be fixed.  Yes, they do need to see that. And that's why even the people that are mad and they don't like you now, they're pissed off of you. I hope they understand your perspective. And that's why I wanted to. First of all, I love you. So I want to have you on because I love seeing you. But I wanted to have you on because I know I know that this means something to you. This is not just like some celeb cause like we were talking about that goofy video that those people made, you know, like I'm going to be held accountable.  I'm going to part of the problem. Now, you're doing that not for the likes. You're losing people, man. I know people are falling off here. They're mad at you, but you're doing it because you mean it means something to you and you actually care and you want people to know, like this is a fucking real problem and it's a problem with black people for sure. It's also a problem with just people. It's it's you know, and this is this better not get lost in this this conversation, this message for sure.  I'm down with police reform everywhere. For sure. For sure. Whether it's Black Lives Matter or, you know, whatever whatever's happening, we need some police reform. We need them to be held accountable. They need to be held accountable for women, for old men, for everybody. They just you can't you just can't just do that. You can't just behave that way. They need to be held accountable.  I think so many of us are based. It's just like the coronavirus. Probably you could say the same thing because I haven't encountered it. I don't think it's real. Just like people haven't encountered an asshole cop, which I find hard to believe or racism, that it's not real, you know what I mean? And, well, white people that discount racism are the most hilarious.  It's ridiculous. Well, that's easy to say. Yes.  Yeah, it's some. The idea that it doesn't exist is pretty silly, and the idea that all cops are good is also pretty silly. All people are not good. It's too hard. It's too hard to be a person. It's hard.  And people need checks and balances every every level of every job. And everything has to have some accountability, has to have everything, some checks and balances. We can't have a government that nobody gets any checks and balances. I mean, every news channel all the time, back checks and talk shit about every tweet that the president makes or anybody. We're constantly doing that. Why do we just blindly just believe that the police don't ever make mistakes? Exactly.  And if we want to all admit that they have a bad, hard job or whatever, that's just as much more reason that we should all be checking in on them and making sure that they're not going fucking apeshit. Well said. Thank you.  You're not a bad guy, Joe, showing you just want to be held accountable. I just want to be held accountable because you're a bad motherfucker and you want bad motherfuckers to be cops. That's right. That's where you go. Not bitch ass dudes, not bitch ass. That's what it is. Yeah, it's really clear. That's that's like that's a respectful position. I was talking to my buddy about it.  Like, can you imagine being scared. You have to go pull this person over. And we think that that guy cops probably pussy, that's why he did it.  But if he knows he's a pussy, he knows he's a pussy walking to the car.  Oh, fuck off. Exactly. Exactly. And that's what we got.  That's who we're dealing with. These are the guys we're giving the guns to. Not all of them, but some of them 100 percent.  That's so important. It's like one of the things you would tell people if you were talking to a kid. And he was like, do you think you think I should do martial arts for self-defense 100 percent?  No, you're a pussy is not cut out for it like those people. But there are those people. Honestly, a lot of those guys are the same to me when I'm strangling folks. Yeah, well, good jujitsu is different, man, because you have to get punched, get really good. There's something about like like you would admit to this, right? There's people that get good at jujitsu that would never get good at striking.  Oh, yes, yes, yes, and because.  Yes, because you actually practiced jujitsu without getting hit in the face, whereas you don't have to practice, you're not going to actually get good at striking unless you're getting struck, which is very difficult.  You got to go into the danger zone so you can stay out of the danger zone. Jujitsu, you could do live drills, you could do a lot of things. But there's sparring is sparring. You know, in the first time some guy fucking punches you in the face and you see stars and your nose starts running and your eyes are watering, you're like, oh my God, because I could make you look great on the pads.  I could teach you the fitness. You could have the body, you could have shadowbox, you could do all of that is when that shit happens.  When that shit happens, it's real. And in jujitsu, you get to go again and jujitsu guy catches you. We all get caught. The guy gets you in an arm bar, OK, tap and you can go right again. If someone flatlines, you you're fucked for the day. You're not. This is not a normal thing for your body to experience and you can't necessarily point that out, at least not when they walk into the gym.  Nope. Right. You train them for a whole fight. That's why I tell my fighters all the time. Is your first, like ten fights? I have no idea. I'm hoping what you're going to do, but I don't know.  Right. Because we'll be there to smoke or smoke or fire. Warm up. Good. A good cut. We're good. You're good. Everything you're saying is great. And then you get out there in front of the lights and it's just not for you.  It's not your time to say or you could be a just engaging who can somehow or another ignore those lights. There's dudes that just ignore those lights. They don't mean shit. That guy comes out, just looks like this. Just dead faced, not freaking out. General Rodriguez, same thing, same time, same thing like ice cold. Yeah, he looks like a guy who would be ice cold.  Ice cold. Those guys excel. Those guys excel. Because how much of a factor is it is dealing with the anxiety?  The first time I caught him for a fight, he let it go, warm up with a up. And everybody every fighter is a little different. Some guys like long warm up, some guys are panicking. Death, like we just keep an eye and see what's going on. So as first time, I'm not sure what he's going to do. We warm them up and it's like, ah, you got like ten minutes for the next guy. And he's like, like, you need anything else?  It's not cool.  He sits down, he gets on his phone, he likes like slickened phone sweeps through and shit.  And I'm like, the commission is like, OK, you're next up. He's like, all right, cool.  And he's just vomitus pumped like nothing's happening. And I'm like, did he warm up?  We did probably 15, 20 minutes. OK, you know, we got we're going to get spot going. Got the first little bit up. But he's was just chillin and I'm like noticing what's going on. And I want to like, make a scene, but I like when he's here as a man. The shit you're doing right now is like it's cool as fuck and all that. But like, make sure you turn the switch when it's time to go.  And he's like, look to me like, yeah, I got it. And sure enough he did it right. I just smoked the guy and the guy had way more experience than him, just a small local show. Then after the fight, we go to the bar. He's got all of his friends and family there and shit. And he's got all the free drinks and like, he puts his arm around me. He was like, hey, man, you know, you were saying like, make sure I turn the switch.  I was like, yeah. And he's like, man, I've been in jail, like, a lot. Like a lot. And I fought a lot of people. I don't get nervous when I find one person.  And I was like, cha ching ching ching ching ching.  They got a winner. We got a winner here, folks. And then I was like, OK, we'll see about this.  But his UFC debut, I won't forget the guy's fucking full name, but he fought a really good guy from New Mexico, the Paul. You don't remember? Man, I can't believe I pull it up. Young Jamie man, the guy there's a lot of respect, he's a really tough dude and he's almost like a gatekeeper, so to speak, and draw. I took it on like two weeks notice and went in there and same thing. He's like warms up real laid back.  He's like, damn, they're sleeping in the locker room. They're like, you're up next, the clock or whatever.  And he's like, totally ice cold.  Then we walk out for the fight and, you know, after the they check your nails and mouthpiece and all that, you have like a moment. Everybody always hugs, which I think is weird, like you're going off to battle or something. But then he turns around and I was like, hey, man, it's a big show. Just take it all in. You got this. Whatever you like. What's the game plan? He's like, fuck this dude up.  Yeah. But want to see. I was like, but how are you do that. He's like kind of like someone move my feet and pick the angles blow but like he was just ice cold and then he stops the dude like he was a phenomenal performance. Like that guy is a rare breed when it comes to staying calm under pressure.  And it's almost like prisons cross feting cross training. That's who's he got to tell me. Oh, sorry, man. Yeah, very bad economist standing guillotines drinking after he. That's a big deal.  Me is very good. He's very sneaky on short notice.  Debu short notice and you're dealing with a guy who's insane amount of competition under his belt. I mean Timmins is a fucking real world class fighter.  Draws the truth. Yeah.  There's guys like that out there but it almost is like cross training. Like prison is like mental cross training, you know.  I mean you think of like dealing with confraternity competition, believing in yourself, like showing up like not a bitch, you know what I mean.  Like that's like if you get a guy and he comes jujitsu and he comes from gymnastics, you're like, oh shit, you never done jujitsu ever.  Like, Dude, you're going to get good quick. You're a gymnast. If you get some guy does the rings, you know, imagine how good he's going to be a jujitsu pommel horse, dude. Yes. Yeah.  One of those motherfuckers. How good is that going to be? He's pushing off hips and shit. And that's kind of the same way you would think about a guy who's been in a lot of street fights and prison fights, like the anxiety aspect of fighting as long as you have the athletic aspect as well.  But having that anxiety alleviation of being known how to keep your shit together, like when someone else is having like an anxiety attack or aspect that deal with and someone else feels right at home.  Not even not not not even the opposite of that. Like feels good. Like he's happy that he sees it.  Yeah. Sees it on their own. Yeah. It's fucking terrifying. Bad place to be. And Joe Schilling did three hours already. Yeah.  Time plus time flies does don't don't feel in any way like you said, anything negative. You are 100 percent right. Everything he said, all that shit you put on your Instagram, it doesn't mean you're a bad person or you're anti cop. You just don't want to see the disgusting shit that you keep posting over and over again.  Yeah, man, I just want like everybody that that are my people, which is all people that are in the United States to like land of the free, home of the brave, like all the shit that we grew up on, thinking this country supposed to be like, let's stick to that. Let's let's hold each other accountable to that, you know.  Yeah. And don't defund the police, please. But they don't need tanks either.  They probably taste. Good bye, everybody. Thank you.
