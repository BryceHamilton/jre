 Hey, friends, how are you doing this episode? The podcast is brought to you by Trager Grills. They give me a copy to read, but I can just talk because this is something I use almost every day. I cook on a Trager Grill minimum four nights a week, maybe five when I'm home.  And I'm home all the time now because it's crazy out there. But listen, there is no better way to cook than on a Trager Grill. First of all, it's the most versatile thing I've ever cooked on.  You can grill on it. You can bake, you can barbecue. There's so many you can smoke. It's it's a pellet grill if you don't know what a grill is. Trager grills, they use hardwood. That's it's like if you buy oak, like if you buy some boards, well, they have to store that stuff. Right. Well, they take that sawdust and they compress it using the natural sugars of the wood. They make these pellets.  Then they take these pellets and you just pour them into the hopper in the grill. It feeds it through a worm drive and it uses a heating element and poof, catches on fire. So it's basically just wood and fire through this really ingenious, complex system. But for you, it's just wood and fire. Your food is cooked by wood and fire and it tastes fantastic. There's also a super smoke option where when you're cooking, especially when you do low and slow, which I like to do a lot of food, if you're cooking under two hundred and twenty five degrees, you hit the super smoke option and accentuates the smoky flavor of the food.  Oh, I love it.  I cook everything on it. I cook vegetables on it. I cook a lot of elk on it, a lot of wild game. It's fantastic for a wild game, it's excellent at maintaining temperature and it has a great application. Their app has fifteen hundred plus recipes and you can control the grill from anywhere with the app. You can lower the temperature, you can check the temperature of the meat probe and if you choose one of the recipes, you can actually navigate the grill with the app.  So like if you there's a recipe it calls for, you know, the the meat has to be cooked at four hundred degrees for X amount of minutes and then two hundred degrees after that or whatever it is, the apple do all that for you. You just say cook with the app boom and it does all that. It's such a versatile tool, it's such an amazingly engineered and designed tool for cooking.  I love trigger grills. They're available online or in ten thousand plus stores nationwide. Visit Trager Grills Dotcom Joe. That's TRF.

My guest today is a brilliant man.  He is a multitalented entertainer and artist. You might know him as a comedian. You might know him as a musician. I know him as a friend. I love him to death. Please give it up for the great and powerful Reggie.  What's going on right now? The Joe Rogan Experience Train by day, Joe Rogan podcast, My Night All Day.  No better person to be here at the end of the world and you know, no finer human being to share this spectacular, chaotic time.  Thanks for being here, brother. Thank you, man. My pleasure.  Thanks for having me. I'm glad I made it. You were saying let's do all the things. Let's do the pandemic. Let's do the riots. Yeah, everything's happening at the same time. Yeah. We're going to space. We're just yeah. We're we're in space. We made it to space.  We just need like some kind of a like a meteor. Like a like a like a meteor that's going to be here in like a month.  But we have to decide what to do. Well, it would be riding. We'd be out of control. Yes.  Apparently, according to Nick Swardson, there's some crazy UFO sightings over Idaho. What I haven't heard anything about this.  Oh, but he said there's some nutty UFO sightings over Idaho. They might be coming in to end this experiment.  They might be like, are you fucking crazy chimps?  We tried we tried to let you guys sort it out, but you're not sorting out shit.  You guys are getting worse. I know.  As someone who was I remember I was like asked a question like, what do you think humanity will like if there was like on a gravestone, what were humanities like? Say, what would you say on humanity's gravestone?  I said, well, we tried it. The old college try. We gave it a shot.  We tried we really tried such a strange time, man. And it keeps getting stranger. It's like, did you see that in India? The monkey stole the coronavirus from the left?  Yes. It's only a gang of monkeys that were like, give me that. And they gave it to him. But the funny thing is they didn't get into it, so they actually were able to keep the specimens intact. Oh, no, he's kind of crazy.  Yeah. Oh, what is it? I wonder what the monkeys thought it was. I don't know. They were probably just like, well, the way they're holding it looks important. I better take it.  Yeah, well, they do that apparently. And then you can give them food and I'll give it back to you to make deals. Yeah. Yeah. Oh the barter. Yeah. They make deals depending on the monkeys, depending on the territory but it turns to deals with people.  That's Yeah. Ah they're so smart man. Yeah. They're like really dumb people.  Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah. Which is saying a lot. It's crazy like Dumphy because they'll fucking. Did you see the one where the monkey ran, use the motorcycle and rode up to the baby and stole the baby. What. Oh my goodness.  Jamie this must pull this one up. It is the crate. I don't, I think I don't want to say Indonesia on a leash.  If you noticed that the monkey was on a leash, somebody had him. Like by how? That's why I came back so fast.  Oh, but it was oh, I don't know, really throttling.  It was like, yeah, the monkey rode a motorcycle down this alley to these people that were sitting there, grabs a baby and starts dragging the baby away. Watch this. Here goes. See, here's the monkey on the motorcycle.  I'll do it from the beginning because I did it rolled up on him. I but do it from the beginning so he can see it.  Watch that seat on the motorcycle. Man pulls up, jumps off, grabs that baby, just grabs him, is pulling the baby away. I mean, first of all, how fucking strong are monkeys?  Yeah, they're really I like how casual the dude is, though. The guy is like, hey, try not to have your monkey take my baby away.  Jamie, where do you see this leash? I don't see dragged away. No, the. Is getting dragged away. It's not walking away.  Oh the monkey it's getting dragged to.  Oh it's just holding he's holding on to the baby and he's being tried. Is that one hundred percent sure. Crazy.  It's not walking away with the baby and yeah. Because he's being yanked and he's trying to go for the kid. So the guy is trying to probably get away from the kid. That's insane.  And that's partly why the guy is so casual too.  I mean, I still don't know why he's being careful about that, but wow, that what the fuck that is so terrifying.  And, you know, the kid's going to grow up and go like, yeah, that happened. Yeah, a lot of stuff makes sense because otherwise, how the fuck would a monkey know how to ride a motorcycle like someone to teach a monkey.  Definitely not like monkeys going like guys someday I can't wait to ride a motorcycle, but maybe if monkeys saw like it's a small motorcycle too, right?  It's like a little kids motorcycle. Yeah, like probably electric. If someone saw, like a monkey saw a person do something, a monkey could probably copy it.  Like there's a photo now if you've ever seen it.  But you see monkey do that is good, right. Yeah. This stuff is really good. Yeah. Clefts the shit 25 milligrams of CBD and it's delicious.  There's a photograph of a famous photograph of of orangutan that is spearfishing and it learn how to do it by watching people look at this monkey.  It's always like, whoa, he's getting after it. Oh my gosh, that's so cool.  Wow, that's so rad.  Oh it's in Asia and Indonesia. So it is Indonesia where I think that's what what they were saying. The other one was, um, see if you can find the photo of the orangutan that's spearfishing.  So it's hanging from a branch with a spear and sticking it into the water. Stab a fish just like it's seen humans do, because that's how the people fished there. Right.  So the I times like, oh, thank God that I think I got it. Wild orangutan spearfishing.  That's so crazy to me. Well, they've said that they believe that primates, particularly some some monkeys and some chimps are in the Stone Age now.  I see. I see they're starting to use tools. They're entering into the Stone Age. So you'll get that photo.  How dope is that? Wow, that's crazy. That's amazing. Look how he's hanging with his feet in his hands.  Yeah, man. And just stabbing into the water. Fish Planet of the Apes man sucks happening. Well, look, we got to think.  I mean, if you believe in evolution and I do. I do, too.  We were that. Yeah.  Yeah, we were some. We were some some form of that. Some form of that. Something happened, something happened that come together. And if they start talking to us, I don't know.  But you know something? We're going to figure out some kind of a computer that's able to like read every tiny micro movement and interpret it to words. Right. You know, and they'll be like mood. And then just words like, oh, I think it's saying this and it's just going to get better and better and better. Who was that gorilla that they taught?  Sign language was her name. Is that Jane? Jane Goodall. But she she was the one she used sign language with primates. Yeah, there was.  But there was one that was really good at it. And this. Oh, in the gorilla.  I don't know if it's in the zoo, if it was in some sort of a research center. I see. But there was one gorilla that could really talk up a storm like had like pretty cocoa. That's right.  Oh yeah. Cocoa. That's yeah. I've had conversations with sign language that's so heavy.  I know. Yeah. Look at this.  Oh Robin Williams hung out with her was Rogers. Oh Mr. Rogers.  Imagine. Whoa look at her. Look at her head.  I mean imagine if you have ever seen the humanzee know oh I'm going to blow you away.  There was this one weird chimp that they were really confused about it. They actually thought it might be a hybrid between a human and a chimp.  Because I want to say this is like the 50s or the 60s. It was really freaky. And this lady kept it.  And I think they eventually had to bring it to some sort of a rescue center because it developed like a very unhealthy sexual relationship.  But this lady wanted to fuck her and was like real jealous of other people coming by, which is. Yeah, that's what happened. That's crazy. Of course. Of course. Yeah. Territorial. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  They say that's what happened to that lady that had that big chimp in Connecticut. Remember that. Yes. When a bit her friends face off. Yes.  Has her friend was cockblock and. Oh whoa. And she might actually fuck that chimp because she used to sleep in the bed with it and she gave that chimp Xanax and red wine which she probably not this humanzee thing.  Humans I. Can't find the accuracy of it, it says it was an unsuccessful excuse me, unsuccessful attempt to create such a thing.  No, no, no, it is not. It's just a chimp. It's just a weird looking chimp. But one of the weird parts about it is that it like to walk on two feet. It's like to walk on two feet. And it looked like a person. It looked like a person fucked a chimp.  Yeah. Look at him.  Oh, wow. Dude, it's creepy. Put these on here. Yeah.  Get a look. Oh, yeah, I have seen a picture creep of this person go to that one on the far to go to the the second row, second to the far left and the black and white one. Oh, this one. Yeah, that one. Look at that one. What in the fuck man. Wow. That is one of the things you say.  His name is Oliver. Yeah. So it's saying.  Yeah. So its name was Oliver. But look at how weird the weird facial expression, particularly in that one image. Now as he got older, he looked more and more just like a chimp. But one of the weird things about him, see if you can find a video of it. Oliver, the humanzee, he used to walk on his back feet.  So it was real creepy. And so that's part of the reason why there was all the speculation that maybe it was like some sort of a hybrid.  It makes sense that there would be like definitely a there's got to be outliers, you know, because so much genetic information is shared between, like all of the animals on the planet, including us.  And we have been looking at pieces of all of it. So. Oh, my gosh. Interesting.  Weird. Yeah. Could be an outlier.  Yeah, well, they did a DNA test on it because it had a very bald face as well. Yeah. Which is one of the other reasons why I think they had some speculation there was some human in it, but they found I was just a chimp, just a weird chimp, just.  Yeah. Just like a yeah. Just unique. Yeah. So, so bizarre. Yeah.  It's super strange. But I mean you got to think if human beings, they think in this form that we're at, we've only been around in this form for somewhere in the neighborhood of two hundred fifty thousand to 450000 years or something like that, they don't really know. But I think on the short end it's like a quarter million years.  So not long now. I mean, it's weird if you look at the evolutionary like the lines, we just go, yeah, it's just a departure. Something something happened to aliens. I know. I personally know favorite thing to think it's my 90 percent. I always go to the 90 percent. I'm 10 percent wrong, but I'm also 90 percent probably. Yeah, I'm. Hi. I'm 100 percent. Yeah.  Something some alien. I mean, mushroom's are aliens, you know. I think so.  You know, they're, they probably came from other places in the universe.  There's probably a bunch of life lichens, you know, like hybrid fungus and molds. You know, that that work synergistically, whatever. Who knows? I mean.  Well, so sideburn can survive. The spores can survive in a vacuum so they can really survive in the vacuum of space. Oh, man. They can survive in extreme temperatures and then extreme cold. Interesting.  So the idea of panspermia, you know, that idea, the building blocks of life came from asteroid impacts. Right.  They think that it's really possible that some sort of fungus could exist on an asteroid. You know, we have chunks of the moon in Antarctica and other parts of the world where some big asteroid hits or a meteor hits the moon. A big chunk flies off. We get sucked into our gravity and slams into earth. Yeah. And if that can happen and you can get some fungus on that, some sort of. Yeah.  Some sort of spores. Yeah. I mean, because water bears survive in space as well. Yep. Like more complex there.  Those tardigrades when you're looking fucking animal, that thing is.  I know it's just like a you know, it's it's the stuff that you don't want to look too much at when you are tripping, because it gives me it gives me existential dread because I'm like I'm like, I don't know what I am anymore.  I don't know what any of us face.  Are we that Takamine mean? It's so awesome. It's such a it looks like it's made of like cardboard, you know, like someone like shape with like papier mâché or velvet. Yeah. Or velvet velvet balloon. It's a system to me. Yeah.  I mean it's of like a saw tube for a nose. Yeah. It's like it's mouth. It's like what a fucking freaky looking nose.  Now how is it a mouth. Yes. How is it even since I guess it's just must be moving in probably I guess smelling nutrients. Nothing kills them other than like squashing them. Right. Yeah. They're really, really, really small. Yeah.  They're really, really tiny. Tiny and they can exist in space. Can you see them with the human eye. I don't think you could there's no way I mean, that looks like scanning electron microscope to try. Well, fucking where and it's got little legs, right?  Yeah, I mean, that's what's fucked up, right, is that all life comes from I mean, the first life that we believe happened on this planet comes from a single cell. Yeah. So it went from a single cell to multiple cells to something like that. Yeah. And then eventually you get a whale or a dolphin. Yeah. Totally a fuckin seagull. Pick up pick a life form like it.  Yeah. I mean it never it never ceases to amaze me just like it just goes on and on and on.  And the more that you look, you know, they're like if they're Adamson's like are they alive. They're definitely not alive. They're just building blocks. But then what's the definition of life? If it if it's using energy and it's creating energy, it's like, you know, then then there's sentience and awareness and conscious and all that stuff. But, you know, it's all around us, man. We're like we're infinitely inside of it.  What does that what what is the narration saying? Something about a special protein. They're tardy, they're disordered because unlike most other proteins, they don't maintain a 3D structure, how exactly they work to protect the water bear, though, the calm water is still a mystery. What's clear, though, is that it could be you'd have big implications for humans. Yeah, great.  You're fucking creepy. Scientists turn us into tardigrades, keep us from getting cancer.  It's like, well, if we harness the T cells from the human being and take bits of tardigrade and we are able to integrate, we just have to get people comfortable with the new shape.  It's like it's it's all science. I mean, we really are just a big experiment ourselves.  Well, you look at fuckers, we only like what we are, what we like, what we look like, you know?  I mean, yeah, I mean, it's it kind of goes like to like what's happening like now, even like with all these riots and protests and all this stuff, it's like, you know, I was talking to a friend about it.  My drummer Garmo grew up similarly like mostly white culture, had parents. I mean, I am half white, half black. So I have my French mom and my my African-American dad, who was from Cleveland, Ohio.  And so the mixture of the two, plus the fact that they were married in 1967, 68 and in the United States, still wasn't legal to marry interracially.  So they were in my lifetime. Yeah. How crazy is that? If you want to talk about the history of racism during my lifetime, it's not legal for African-Americans to marry white people.  That's that's correct. Yeah. Yeah. And also and then the Chinese had their own their own pathway to they had to like I think they were later.  But after that I think so. Yeah, I think so.  But there's it's just like, you know, all that stuff and anything about like how much like went on and to to get me to a point at which I can just be chill in me, like go hey what's up.  You know, like I'm going to go buy a snack now I have to like have to think about that because it's you know, my mom reminds me all the time, thankfully, because I tend to operate from like I'm a human first. And my characteristics and my character in the way that I treat other people is the primary thing that I'm working from. And I'm aware of that. I look a certain way that might trigger certain people, but that's not how I operate.  I don't operate from that. I go for the character first.  Then if I start to detect there's something else happening, then I can modulate and figure something out.  But I don't want to constantly assume which growing up in Montana, I would have blown I would have exploded if that was the way I was doing stuff.  Because most of the time, Montanans, even if they're kind of I'm uncomfortable with a black person, even if that was the case and I come up and I'm I'm having conversation with them and after a while they're like, oh, that's cool. Oh, you help me with my they. Oh yeah. Thanks a lot for. Oh that's cool. And then we're just kind of getting along and they didn't even realize it's like a sneak attack when part of Montana.  You grew up in. I grew up in Great Falls. Where's that and what's in the what's a big city year? There's no big city. It's it's the closest.  It's the closest would be the capital, Helena. OK, but it's not it's but Great Falls is I think is bigger than Helena. So Grateful Falls about sixty five thousand. But it's got an Air Force base and it's got an oil refinery and some cannery. It's like Budweiser and Pepsi.  We there because someone in your family is in the military. Yeah, my dad. Yeah. My dad was a two time Vietnam vet, was first in the army, then he left the army after four years and then applied with the Air Force and then went back and got in the Air Force and they sent him back again. Holy shit. Which was kind of crazy. But then he survived it, you know, moved to or moved to a base in Germany because they were decommissioning.  Remember, like in France, we had bases, the United States had bases. And then Charles de Gaulle at the time was like, we don't want your bases in the air anymore. So all your bases belong to us. All your bases belong to us. Yes, we will absorb your bases and the United States like, oh, no, we'll get out of there first.  And we're like, OK, but yeah. So he was helping to decommission a base.  That's how he met my mom. Oh yeah. His name is Charles. And they met in a bar called the Charlie Bar, which I thought was kind of.  Oh wow.  And then just decided to go to Montana because the base was there. No, well, he we were stationed for a second. We went all over Europe. So I was born in Stuttgart.  Then we moved around Spain, Italy, I think. Yes, Spain and Italy. And then when I was four years old, we had a choice of two places to go to. And they picked Montana because Montana had better at a better school system or something at the time. And then I moved there when I was four and I wasn't even a citizen. I was a citizen of nothing until I was four years old or five years old.  Yes, I was a noncitizen. How weird is that?  That's really weird. It's not weird. It's it is weird. Yeah, it's not weird because the circumstances. Well, it's not weird because you're a human being on earth. It's weird that you have to be assigned a patch of dirt.  I know there. You know. I know. I know. Well Tribe do you belong to youngins like. I don't know I. To say he has not decided the young one has not decided. I mean, it was I mean, it's weird if I think about it, I'm a kind of an immigrant, but not kind of not. Well, you're American.  Yeah. You have American parents. I have.  Even if like Brian Cowen was born, in fact, where was he born? He was born and somewhere freaky.  Maybe Saudi Arabia, like Abu Dhabi or something like that, something outlandish because his family was on the road all the time as well, right? Yeah, same same sort of deal.  Yeah. Where you're kind of not you're not a citizen. I figure what they call it, there's a status for that. But traitor. It's a traitor. Yeah, it's a traitor.  Dangerous insider. Yes. Spy. Yes. Someone naturally trusted today. Yeah, totally. It's like he's the perfect one. He's not connected to anyone. He has no children. Yes.  No, I mean, yeah, I guess it was like I was in Montana when I remember. I kind of vaguely remember being in the courthouse and being made a citizen.  Oh, wow.  Of the United States for when I was five, I think. Oh yeah. So for for so I was like in the United States, like I wasn't in I was a noncitizen of I was a non citizen of the world.  And then then I became an American citizen. So strange. Yeah. Very, very strange.  I think about it. It's like all the ingredients are insane. Like I'm so, I'm so stoked I got to grow up where I got to grow up. And I had the experiences that I got to experience. And I love Montana and I love my friends from Montana. And I like being a guy that people are never expect from Montana.  And it's like, well, you're you're an unusual guy in that you're very left wing like me, but you're also very Second Amendment, pro Second Amendment for sure. Like me. You know, I find like you and I have very big parallels.  And that's true. Like, you know, all for everyone's rights, like for everything.  I mean, just I want people to be free to do whatever. Yeah.  But when shit like this goes down and people just randomly lighting targets on fire and, you know, and, you know, smashing windows and stealing things and knocking cars over and pulling people out of trucks, now you understand that the veneer of civilization is very thin.  And yes, the chaos of being is very deep.  And it's I don't ever want to have too easy gun ever.  No human being ever in my life. If I if I make it to the grave and never have encountered anyone that I needed to shoot to protect my or my loved ones lives, I'll be a happy person. Yes, of course. But I'd be much happier if I get to make that choice, you know, and I get to have the opportunity or the ability to protect myself or to protect someone I care about.  Well, I mean, it's like it depends on the climate that you're you know, we live in a climate that is like for very so many reasons.  We've gotten to this point at which essentially I could just say a blanket, the blanket blame goes to capitalism in general. I mean, I'm sure like you talk about this on this on the show a lot in capitalism, in its most fundamental state is just essentially trade. It's what humans did at you know, you set up a fruit stand and like someone's got bread and someone's got you know, you trade. And then there's kind of like an understood value for things.  And on a basic level, it's just kind of what we do as human beings.  We barter, we trade things like that. But then you flash forward and you like overlay complexity over complexity or complexity that is then guided by people who are like, oh, I can game the system a little bit more.  I can game the system a little bit more.  And now you get all these hoarders and hoarders and people and chokepoints of resources. Right.  And then they're they're kind of dictating the value, blah, blah, blah, blah.  Same thing goes with the arms, you know, it's like, yeah, I enjoyed the reason why I enjoy my ability to have a firearm is because I respect their power.  I'm in I'm an engineered minded minded person, so I like the engineering and the craftsmanship behind it. And I like the responsibility and the safety factor of it that people take it seriously.  When I grew up, people were really adamant about the safety of guns, everything that whenever I touched a gun, looked at a gun before you pick it up, they'd be like, never put your finger on the trigger, never pointed it at anybody unless you plan on firing it.  All the things that we all hear about gun owners are supposed to be taught. And so growing up with guns, I didn't really fear them.  They were just a thing, you know, and my my whole mom's side of the family is all police, police people.  And my dad was a military policeman. He was in the military.  So, you know, guns like that was just a part of the thing. Farmers hunting all that stuff. Great fall. Same thing going over my friend's house, seeing a deer hung up, strung up, you know, on the rafters with a bunch of cardboard on the ground, you know, getting ready to be processed, all of that stuff.  And for me, I came back to guns like maybe like ten years ago or something like that, because I wanted to I was interested in training and overcoming my fear of handguns. And and so that fascination was great and went to Montana. And my experiment was like, how long will it take me to get a handgun?  You know? And I walked into a sporting goods store, went to one of my favorites, walked in, timed it twenty minutes. I walked out and I had a bag with a handgun and ammunition in the bag and I was walking out of the store.  So there's no waiting period. No. Now you fill out the you know, the the background check. You do the background check now, like it looks like there's no red flags, whatever, you can have the gun. Wow.  Which which part of me is like part of me is like, if you're responsible gun owner and you respect firearms, that seems kind of normal. You're like, oh, I'm responsible.  I know how to use this weapon safely. I'm going to buy this gun and I'm going to walk out. Right. And that was my first firearm I ever bought.  Whilst it was an interesting experiment, I will say, and when I talk to all my law enforcement friends and Munt in Montana, like, you know, who was the guy who walked in, he walked in his suit and had a full on three piece suit and then had his carry concealed carry on him and then walked in with a huge bag of, like, crazy guns.  But he is a prosecutor and has to have security when he when he goes to cases and things like that, because when they get convicted, sometimes people stick their friends on them and stuff like that. Anyways, he's never had any altercations.  But an interesting guy really like very heavily armed, bla bla bla bla. And I start talking to him.  I was like, what would happen if in order to get a firearm you had to like back when the NRA was the one truly was the NRA when it was a bunch of like war vets who are like, this is how you use firearms safely.  Like way back in those days, if people had to go through training and had to be evaluated, had to pass driving, like when you drive to get your driver's license, you have to get into a car and you have to instructor there and you have to like pass these tests.  And when I talk in that way, they're like, I don't really have a problem with that.  And like, yeah, because you're promoting you're only doing yourself a favor, right? You're you're promoting safety and you're educating people about firearms. And it's up to them if you want to have a firearm or you don't want to have a firearm.  But if you do, you have to know how to safely operate a firearm. And there are many kinds of firearms.  They're not all the same thing. So anyways, but it was interesting conversation.  That is a powder keg of a conversation.  Right. And if you even intimate just just just beat around the bush, that may be a good idea for people to learn how to use a gun before they buy trader.  You fucking trader. You fucking Second Amendment is a right.  I know. And that's right. I know. And I and you know, and it's so funny because that's why I like whenever I've got a bunch of friends, they got concealed carry all the time for their professions and Great Falls and I'm sitting down with them. They've got a firearm on them. I never feel like nervous or anything like that.  But and but they're highly opinionated about people who open carry to blow open carry.  They're always like those people are almost always concealed carry permit. People always say that they don't like those people because it's you have a weapon that's visible and it doesn't have a fancy biometric lock on it. There's nothing it's like if you're in a situation, if someone walks up behind you and takes a gun, they just now they've got a gun. And you just told everybody you just shown everybody that you have a firearm.  And so there's this weird thing about open carry, that concealed carry. People are like, this is ridiculous.  Well, you can do it if it's legal in your state. Certainly. Is it a good decision? I don't. I don't. I don't think so.  It's probably not a good decision to do it when you just go in Walgreen's. But that's what I'm saying.  It probably exists so that no one can ever infringe upon your rights to have one in any capacity. So if you're sure, you know, I'm saying so. It's not a thing where you want to do all the time. But if you if some shit goes down and you have a gun outside of your house, the the law should be you could do whatever the fuck you want.  Like the law says, you're allowed to open carry so you can have this gun outside your house. Doesn't mean you go to the movies with the fucking AK 47 strapped to your chest. Yeah.  Which people do. And I and I get it in the whole thing about like the gun issue is that it needs to start somewhere and it should start at education. Yes.  You know, education's the that's the key, right. Yeah. And some people are great at it. Most people that I know that are into guns are very into the safety aspect of it. And they understand it. And it's yeah, it's very important to them. Yeah.  But it's one of those things where, first of all, here's what's weird. I know so many people that want to gun now, so many people are asking for all these liberals, so many liberal friends of mine are asking me.  They're like, I know you have a gun to feel like whether I was like, what is the take on?  I was talking about two different friends who have had friends.  Ask them if they can borrow a gun much against loan someone to you.  But you people that are anti-gun are hilarious because they don't know that there are rules like this idea that there's no rules.  No, there's rules. Yes. All they hear about is, oh, what about the gun show loophole? They start talking about the gun show loophole.  Yeah, yeah. Go to a gun show then see the gun shows. No. Well, you can have my gun. Get the fuck out.  Yeah, I know, I know. It's so that's the thing. That's that's the thing that's so hard about it because like for me I'm like I'm a pragmatist and and to me it's always about awareness, it's always about education.  And the thing that the conversation always breaks down on either side where it's like if it's a gun, not in there, like any hint of something that says we're going to have to talk about this, you know, out there like no. And then the people who are really anti-gun, they're like, any hint that there might have to be a compromise maybe.  Then they're also equally like, no, and it's nothing's ever going to get done unless you get soldiers, cops, people who use guns for who have to use guns for a profession, talking to people who are heritage gun owners, people who've been growing up for generations, doing that to people who live in urban situations where there's illegal gun sales and black market guns and there is a problem with guns and they're in their communities, all that stuff needs to be talked about.  But but the sides are so entrenched, it's very, very, very difficult.  Well, I think something like what we're experiencing right now, these riots and the looting, this opens people's eyes. This is like we're talking about our liberal friends that are very interested in getting a gun now. This opens people's eyes. You realize like this is not no one's on a power trip. You're just talking about your ability to safely defend your loved ones and yourself. That's that's how you're talking about.  Absolutely. 100 percent. You know, and I'm my thing is, too. It's like technology is amazing. And and and guns are an interesting form of technology because obviously, if, again, in a healthy situation, you're like, oh, did you see the new blah blah, blah, blah, blah?  Oh, yeah, they enhanced this. Oh, there's a treatment for the silence is deafening silence. I have a class one license, all that geeky stuff as geeky as people working on engines and hot rods.  Right. Right, exactly. There's that right. Then there's the whole cultural thing that movies, you know, like bad boys and they're just guns are just stuff that people just have and they're just shooting around. And the thing is, like people never understand, when you talk to a war vet about guns and and gunfights and firefights, especially recent firefights, they're like, I never, ever, would ever wish you to ever be in a gunfight, ever.  And so and I and I believe them because I know things can change so quickly. A bullet, when you shoot a gun and it hit somebody and it ends their life, even if they were, like, threatening you, so forth, that is one of the most traumatic things that can happen in a human being's life. And they have to live with that all the time.  I mean, soldiers, at least they have like I'm on a side and I'm trained, you know, and they're psychological help and all that stuff are police officers. Same thing. Most of them never even draw their weapons. But when they do and they do fire it, the consequences are devastating on a psychological level.  But I will say that, you know, my friend of carries, I was like, what if the first three rounds that you have in your personal protection gun, like at home or whatever, your handgun, whatever it is worth, the first three rounds or rubber, and then there were live rounds after that.  And he was like, oh, that's an interesting idea.  And I'm like anything to protect yourself, but not necessarily guaranteed that you're going to kill kill somebody if it's you know, if it's a weird situation, situations happen fast. And I understand when someone comes into your house, all bets are off, whatever you need to do, however you feel if someone breaks in your house, that's the I understand that completely.  But for me, I'm like, what can I do to make it really hard for someone to even get to me in the first place?  And my last last last resort is a weapon that can kill somebody. That's my very, very, very last. But I'm going to do everything I can to be as preemptive as possible, to not be enticing for people to want to come up and attack. Yeah.  These rubber bullets that these cops are using, can't protesters how fucked up is this that they're just shooting them into people. Yeah. Directly. Yeah.  They're supposed to hit them off the ground. They're shooting them at fuckin reporters. You see those reporters, your reporters interviewing these people and like I.  What the fuck.  Yeah, they're just getting shot at. I know by cops that know they're reporters. Yes, I know.  And a reporter lost her I recently ABC reporter. Someone like that.  Yeah. Got hit in the eye with a rubber bullet just recently. Like yesterday or so. Oh my God.  And lost an eye that happened to when I was at the WTO riots. You know, like one second you're like, oh, cool.  The chief of police is talking to the lead organizer and he's got his helmet off and everyone's like, oh, this is cool. They're all talking. And then from behind the police lines, you hear a bullhorn. We're going to be launching tear gas. Please clear the area. And I'm like, wait a minute. But you guys were just talking and saying, oh, I don't know. And he doesn't know because there was another order placed by someone that wasn't him.  And then suddenly it turns into pandemonium.  And the next thing you know, another dude loses. A guy that I knew that was a friend of a friend lost his eye in the WTO. Right. Because the guy, the the police officer shot at him directly instead of bouncing it off the ground.  It's just like and it comes down to my gun, my gun guru dude that I was, you know, training with for for a film. And that's kind of launched me back into into stuff. But he was saying training, training, training. It's like when it comes to police officers, it's community outrage, reach being able to actually establish a contact with your community so that you they can at least have some form of trust or someone that they can talk to that they can relate to.  So they understand the police are there for the protection. Then the other thing is like training. A lot of these officers are just like they're just. Sending them out and going, hey, good luck. Deal with stuff as it happens, and then some of the cats are like, they don't know and they their anger gets the best of them. Someone's being indignant and they're like, you know what? I'm going to lay it down.  I just think most people do not have the kind of temperament and character to deal with being in the position of having control over the people who really ultimate fatal control over other people.  I just don't think they have that. I think most people I mean, I think that takes a really powerful person and there are powerful people out there that handle and handle it well. And they're great cops. Yes. And then there's guys like that guy who put his fucking knee on that man's neck for eight minutes and thirty eight seconds or whatever it was. And finally, the family got their own autopsy and the autopsy showed the man did die from association.  Yeah. Not not just asphyxiation, but also from the blood being cut off to the brain, which is which is really what it is. It's a blood choke because you're putting your shin on the side of the neck. It's cutting off the carotid artery. It's like a choke, like like a jiujitsu choke.  You know, the idea that that's not what killed him is like, come on. What was just a coincidence? I mean, what is the autopsy? The how corrupter your fucking medical medical examiner's man?  I'm telling you, it's yeah, I know where they're like. We need to get we need to get ahead of this.  And it's like, you know, just like he had preexisting conditions. Yeah. Yeah. It's called being black. Yes, yes. Yes. That's the existing condition. I know. I know. Well being God and being arrested, especially by that guy, that guy had 12 different abuse forms that were. Yeah. Abuse claims against him over the years.  Yeah, I know. And the guys that were just kind of sitting there, you know, the cops that were sitting there, it's like they. Yeah. Again, it's also a training issue.  It's like, you know, and if you're a cop and you you you've noticed another fellow officer in the field doing some shit that they think is like not cool or just straight illegal whatever, or they have a feeling that it's going to escalate with this person if if it's left unchecked, they really it's hard for them to communicate to you because there's this whole brotherhood loyalty thing that locks everybody into like this code of silence.  And it sucks because. Well, how do you expect police departments to get better? Police departments aren't allowing themselves to get better.  Well, some some people that do step out, they get in trouble. Right? Some people that do call out other officers for shitty behavior. But there was one woman really recently, I think it was either yesterday or today. There was a guy and he's arguing with these protesters, this male cop, and this woman gets on her knees in front of him and says she's on her knees and he shoves her to the ground when when she's on her knees and this female officer gets in the guy's face and starts yelling at him and and he as he's walking away, she's chasing him down and yelling at him, oh, God.  And it's all on video. So there are examples of good cops who see cops being abusive. And this guy was clearly abusive. Like there's one guy standing there and he got right in the guy's face, like intimidating them and then and then pushed the girl down.  Look, there's a lot of people that shouldn't be cops. And then the stress of those situations where you you're trying to take control of a mob, you know, it turns back or you get that sheriff from Flint, Michigan. Did you see that video?  That was amazing. Amazing. It was amazing.  Beautiful brings a tear to you. I really did. He's like, we're going to put down the batons. We're going to march with you. Yes. We're all together in this. Yes. And, you know, and we want you to have a voice. Yeah. And then he's hugging people and everybody's hugging everybody. Yeah. And they're walking together. So imagine the cop that pushed the lady down and put him in that situation with those people.  Yeah. That same aggro attitude. He'd be yelling at people and tell them to shut the fuck up and push them away. And it probably would have escalated. Or imagine that cop with in the other scenario, with that woman on the ground, he probably like, ma'am, I don't want you on your knees like we're all in this together, like we all saw what happened to that man. And it's an injustice. Let's walk together. Let's let's try to heal this community.  Let's try let's try to do better. Yeah.  That's what I want to see, man. I mean, that's all that's all it comes down to. It's a you know, I it's all about behavior, how you handle a situation in the moment.  And again, if they had a little bit of training, just a little bit of training to say like stop before I think stop think then assess the situation. And, you know, unless your life is in danger, like, you know, but that these situations are not that these are cops that are like something happens. There's like something clicks and there's chaos all around. And the instinct is like essentially the same mentality as someone who's taking advantage of it on the other side, who are like the people who come out after the initial rage wave of like, oh, you know, which is a natural kind of biological instinct and it's a rebalancing.  But then they're the opportunists that sneak in behind the wave. And those are the people that you see like targeting in a very organized way, targeting these stores, knowing exactly where they're going to go and they're going to take advantage of these moments of chaos. Yes. And of course, that gets mixed in when the cops see that. And it's like, well, they kind of get on get in on that wavelength instead of the majority wavelength, which is just like we're pissed, we're emotional, we're loud, but we're allowed to do this.  Have you seen these bricks that people have been finding at all these different sites where people are protesting these organized stacks of bricks? No, no. Yeah, man. Look, this is I'm going to send Jamie I'm going to send you one that Eddie sent me.  Who do you think is putting that? That's the question, right? It's like, who is who is putting that? Is it antifa? Is it the cops? It's is it someone who wants someone to throw a brick so that they can impart martial law? Like, what is it?  Yeah, I you know, my my brain always goes to conspiratorial. Here it is. Mysterious brick piles appear throughout major protest cities.  I mean, these are bricks that are appearing that don't have a reason to be there. Jamie, I'm going to send you this video that Eddie sent me because this is a airdropping to you.  But that man in the car to the bait car, they said and yesterday he left a car out there and they lived in really shitty a fucking free car for people to just take a free police car.  So they left an old shitty police car out there. And then on top of that, this this old.  Why is this not OK, Jamie, I'm airdropping to you right now.  So this old shitty police car and then these three, you have all these protesters and then these three people move in a very organized fashion.  And there's a guy who made a video about, have you seen the video, Jamie, where the guy breaks down the anti. Have you seen that? I'll send you the video because. What's that? I never saw this. Yeah, OK. Put it up on the screen. I got to figure out, OK, photos. Oh, I see. That's so crazy. So there's this. There it is. So these random pallets of bricks, this is very organized.  This is on Ventura Boulevard out here in L.A. or I think it's in North Hollywood.  So these pallets of bricks are just sitting there. Look, look at this, what you just like like riot supplies. Exactly right, supplies? Not exactly. So who's doing this?  This is very organized. I mean, how many stacks of these bricks?  It's very anti anarchist. Well, is it organized?  But I mean. Well, it's fuel for anarchy, right? Yeah, but I just I wonder. Look look at this. Do you think do you think I mean, here's another theory.  Could be possibly performance art.  I mean I mean and I'm not saying that like as a joke, but like some performance artists like you go to that length. But that's very, very organized and very ominous and very weird.  I mean, I hope that those are reported and that the police picked them up.  Well, one thing that is happening that's promising is these provocateurs are getting caught by actual Black Lives Matter protesters grabbing them. And these assholes that are breaking windows and spray painting things like they're grabbing these people and saying, hey, fuck, and they're turning these people in, like these people are smashing things. They're recognizing that this is damaging to this. Look, there's a great moment in time right now where we can enact real change.  Well, you can this is like you get this and it's really the perfect storm in terms of its horrific nature.  You see this guy who's nonchalantly got his knee on this man's neck for eight minutes and thirty eight seconds.  Just just there's no there's there's no justification. It's very clear. It's horrific. There's no blurriness. There's no gray area.  It's just dirty. It's awful. It's evil.  And then the man dies and everybody is for a fantastic reason, upset. And they want change and they're marching through the streets.  But then when you see these bricks and then we see the chaos and there's they've got cops, cops that people knew were cops wearing police officers, police, police just distributed gas masks, like official gas masks, like the ones that the cops use, like the same wardrobe that cops where everything's black, all military issue shit.  Yeah. And then these people would chase them. Are you a fucking cop like this? Guys breaking windows at Target and then someone in the comments is like, I know that is that guy is a cop. And they were they were calling out the guy's name. So this cop is going around while these peaceful protests are going on and he's smashing windows with a gas mask on, fully dressed in military issued garb.  And people like, well, that's an agent provocateur, but is he acting on his own? You see a rogue cop. He's like as you like one of those crazy firefighters that lights buildings on fire so that they can save them. Right. Is he citing this of what is going on here?  It's a I think some people just wish they want it to turn into something.  Oh, yeah. Massive. And they want it to be like a civil war. And and there's also like the whole race war thing that, you know, you hear about in a white supremacists and stuff like that, talk about, you know, and there's then there's like the right. The thing is, like your mind can swim in all kinds of like conspiratorial ways. And it's probably it's a mixture of all kinds of things. Yeah.  It's definitely like it's probably like, hey, I'm going to do this or like, hey, we should do that. Or someone kind of kids around and someone's listening, you know, in the police, police department or whatever. And they're like, yeah, what if we were doing that or whatever. And they hear that they're like, I am going to do that, who knows? But that's some dangerous shit. And I think that that's amazing that that that protesters who are seeing this are detaining these people because those people, they're just not helping in any way.  And I'm here.  Here's a good one. So this asshole is smashing things and this guy comes over and grabs some fucking body. Slams them. Yeah.  And then everybody else, the guy down there screaming and yelling at them. Yeah. They hold this guy. Yeah.  Just pass them over the police to. Yeah. These these are antifa. Yeah. He's trying really hard to cover his face. Yeah.  It's like no no fuck you. What are you hitting with a hammer. What was. He was making bricks off the sidewalk.  Oh and that's so. Oh yeah. Yeah yeah. Good. Like here. How old is that dude. I don't know. It's very frail. Should he. I mean I think they took him down.  There's definitely some anarchists that are like, you know, they're basically they're like, we're doing this, this is our time.  And you know that there's like a whole wave of those people. Because, I mean, I remember going to Brandenburg, Germany, a friend of mine out there has like a bunch of kind of anti organic anarchists, but like kind of mellow version, German mellow version of that bot, a bunch of land that was actually like a weird shaki history. But it's like Goebbels training camp for the Nazi youth.  And then it was before that it was like a Polish, I don't know, like Air Force place or something like that.  Anyways, it has like this military weird shaki history. But they bought it and they've. Converted it, and now it's like very accepting of all people, like all kinds of people live on there. And then there are people who work on the what's it called the Fusion Festival, which is one of the biggest festivals in the world in Germany.  That's in Brandenburg. And it's an amazing festival.  It's all just love based techno, you know, but it's got that hard edge of, like, anticorporate. It's all DIY, but it's massive. It's like 70000 people festival. It's like Burning Man in the woods.  And very interesting conversations that you hear from them. But every German.  I don't I don't I mean, a tiny bit ambition, but not not not a lot.  I actually was trying to learn German. I love the German language.  Do they speak English? Yeah, they speak English. So when you have these conversations. Yes. Yeah, we're speaking in English. Yeah. I remember once because I was renting in an Audi R8 v ten plus and I drove it onto the grounds when they were tearing down and this young woman came up with a spray paint can and was like shaking the can and going like, what are you doing here with this kind of a vehicle? And it was this weird, tense standoff.  But I was with one of the people who was like one of the how she was going to spray paint your car. Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.  And a bold lady I know. And in a way, like I was like, you know what? If she would have done it, that's fine. I was in her territory, you know, fuck that. I mean I mean, I'm OK with like when it comes to like, people who are that passionate about, like anticorporate and stuff like that, I'm like, I get it. But that's your property.  Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I'm, I'm renting it. But she doesn't know that. She doesn't know that. But but I did and I had a feeling she wasn't but but inside my head I was like, what if she did?  And then be like, well I guess I just have to try this out with like this fascist antifascist whatever symbol on the on the side of the car, which I don't you know, it's like it's a funny thing, like no good ever comes out of that.  That's the problem. No, no good ever comes out of defacing property. There's no compromise gets reached. No conversation gets breached. No, no, no.  Not when you're destroying now when you're destroying history and you're destroying it's just destruction again, as an initial response.  Understandable if something happens and people go out and they're young, especially in this in this climate, you know, being cooked up, no jobs. What do you want to do? Let's rally behind this. This is ridiculous. Whatever boom initial like, who knows what's going to happen in that chaos when everybody goes outside. I get that the continuation of it as the standard behavior.  That's that's a problem that any leader, any civil leader is going to condemn and frown upon. Because at the at the end of the day, I'm a pragmatist and it's just inefficient.  It's just very inefficient.  And it's a funny way to look at it. Inefficient. It's like, how are you going to use that energy?  Like harness the energy for if you want real change, you got to like you got to figure, you have to strategize.  And for me, I'm about hacking. Like, we got to hack this system.  Yeah, but you're this guy who's like really into engineering. You're very thoughtful. That's not what you're dealing with, with these burn it to the ground motherfuckers. These people don't have a plan B and they don't have no forward strategy.  They just want to a fucking tear down capitalism. And then what? How are you going to get your food? You fuck. What are you going to eat? Your shoes. Who's making your shoes?  Where did you get your car, you fucking idiot. Where'd your phone come from? I'll give you a hint. Not America. Yes, I know you have to get made, dumdum. It's enough to engineer them. It is really like it is. And I, I agree with that one. Using capitalism to fight capitalism.  Yes, they're using the Internet and social media sites on cell phones that they bought. Yes. Yes.  Of without a doubt. I mean, here's the thing is this is what's so weird about it is that it's such a paradox.  Right? I mean, essentially what you're describing. Yeah.  So, like, if you want to effect change, you're either going to fit into the feedback loop or you're going to feedback into the feedback loop, or are you going to figure out a way to shift it so that you're able to spiral away from it. And that's really what we need.  And I like people taking responsibility for getting rid of the fuckwit that are that are like fucking it up for everybody because guaranteed whether it's the police or whether it's protesters, it's always a very, very small percentage of those people are going to fuck it up because also the news loves sensationalism.  So we're going to focus on that, I think.  Well, that's what we're dealing with right now. It's really the perfect storm. OK, you have a bunch of pieces in place. First of all, there's a lot of people that never really recovered from the 2008 crisis. Right. As people are very upset that the bankers and these subprime mortgage loans and the housing crisis and everything went chaotic. People lost shit, tons of money. And then all of a sudden you have this pandemic and the pandemic comes along and people cannot work.  So for the first time ever, through no fault of your own, you literally can't work for months and months at a time. There's a staggering number of people right now that. They are in desperate states, there is a terrible position financially they're about to lose their home, they're about to lose their car, they're about they don't know what the fuck they're going to do to feed themselves. Yeah.  And then you get this murder and the murder just lights all this dry wood.  And then everybody says, look, these people are all full of shit. Donald Trump's full of shit. Nancy Pelosi's full of shit. They're all monsters. It's all bull. Gavin Newsom is full of shit. Let's fucking burn it down. Let's steal that smash. And that's taking apart. That's that's happening while these peaceful protests are happening. All the while, people just got done watching the Joker.  So the joke. Yes, I know.  Which is this fucking billion dollar movie where this guy kills everybody and burns to the ground, shoots people on TV.  And here's the problem. You kind of cheer for him. You kind of cheer for.  And of course, if this is a movie and a bunch of people like, look, we're going to fucking end this corrupt system of capitalism, start smashing windows, burning things, part of you would be going let's see how this turns out.  Yeah. How is this going to turn out? It's kind of an interesting choice, like, wow, these guys are getting radical. Do they have a plan? But then if the movie in the movie, like if you saw these pallets of bricks just mysteriously appearing at these areas where people are scheduled to protest and where these these marches are supposed to go by, like, what is the fuck is going on here?  Yeah, it's it's there's something else at play that's like trying to, like, push it over into that fantasy to move it from the fantasy into the reality.  In my left wing, friends think it's right wing people are agent provocateurs that are trying to start this sort of chaotic scene so that the military can be called in, which is what essentially Trump apparently did today.  Oh, yes. Yeah, yeah. Apparently. Jamie, why is everybody saying that it's martial law? Is that something that happened after his speech? Well, during his speech, he was essentially saying that if they didn't call in the National Guard, he was going he's going to bring in the military, which is I don't think I don't know if he can do that.  I don't think he can do that.  That's that statement, I think is what they're taking as martial law. Yeah, essentially. Yeah.  Which which in a weird way it goes against. I mean, like you you know, you're talking about left wing people saying, like it's the right wing.  And I'm sure that there are right wing people that are like saying, oh, it's the left wing because they wanted to wing it. Yeah, they think it's antifa. So it's like all this finger pointing, whoever's doing it is definitely winning for their point of view because they're like, well, we're doing it. No one knows who it is and we're just doing it.  Well, agent provocateurs have been used from the beginning of time. I mean, they've always done that Hitler burn the Reichstag. He did that to incite the people of Germany to get behind him and that he was going to take control of such a narrow, burned Rome. Same way, I mean, it was all done in order to get people excited about this idea of this one person saving them from this attack. And that has been done forever. Yeah.  Alex Jones had a great video called 911. The Road to Tyranny was the first time I really understood that agent provocateurs or a government strategy. And he detailed like very this is like. I guess it was like 2001 or 2002 that he put this video out and he detailed how the World Trade Organization, when those people were protesting against the WTO and this is in Seattle. Yeah, I was there. OK, so when you were this was you were there in 2000.  I was.  There was just before it blew up was I actually don't know what time it was early 2000, early 2000s, maybe 2000, 2001 or so. So these people were protesting against the WTO.  And then these guys dressed exactly like that guy I was talking about earlier, all black face covered military issue outfits, military shoe Vibram soled shoes, all dressed, uniformly started smashing windows, smashing cars, pushing over like a post office box is lighting things on fire.  And then they wound up shutting down all the protests and even had they had a no protest zone where people were showing up at work, where they had a WTO stick to a pin with a red line through it, they made them take that pin off of their jacket before they went through the line because you couldn't have anything that was anything, any sort of protest. It was crazy. Like this is all documented in this film. Then they they eventually all these guys who are the agent provocateurs holed up in a building and then the police negotiated with them and then released them.  So there was some sort of an order order from higher up and they were all released. Interesting. They use these guys.  They used military people, some branch of the government who knows what the fuck they were, who they were. They used them to turn a peaceful protest about a legitimate concern these people have about the doings of the World Trade Organization. And they turned it into a violent encounter that they could then justifiably bring in the police and shut everything down.  It makes sense. That's what people are worried about with these, because they're worried about these bricks, these bricks. This is horseshit. And this is this is done to shut down the peaceful protests where people are legitimately and righteously concerned about ending police brutality because it's been going on forever. It's been going on too long.  Yeah. I mean, yeah. I mean, I just at this point, it's like I don't I don't put past any measure by people that want to maintain their bottom line, like they'll do whatever it takes. And it's like, again, you know, when it when it comes to stuff like that, I'm like, I want to stay informed.  I want to turn I want to keep those ideas in mind in the most simplistic way, which is if you've got a lot of shit, you can do whatever it takes to keep your shit right.  And you'll do all kinds of crazy shit to try to maintain power and control and and vice versa.  And what really sucks is that if you did the opposite, if you did with that sheriff, did you you actually get not only get what you want, but you get more. Yeah.  And that's what I don't understand, the virus of doing evil badly. That's what I guess what I think of it as being very inefficient and terrible, at being selfish and greedy. If you were really selfish and if you're really greedy, you would make sure that the well-being of your population was met so that there was reverence for your position.  And if there's reverence for your position, then you have the goodwill of people. It's easier to make things happen. However, people don't get that.  That's five DHS. Yeah, man. I mean. I mean, come on. It's like no, but either way I don't think like that. Right. I know they do. They just want to roll in power. It's like the type of person that wants to be in that position is the type of person that just wants control and power. They want people to be afraid of them, like the way even the way Trump talks about it. You know, he talks about using dogs.  He's talking about using the most vicious dogs, like he says is such a foolish he's got such a foolish way of communicating in times of crisis. And that's what's really dangerous, because some people are really good in times of crisis, like Obama was very good in times of crisis.  During George W, George W. gave a speech after 9/11 that made everybody love him. Everybody was like, this is our guy. He's going to take care of us. But I don't I don't agree with him on certain political issues. Obviously, there's clearly evil in the world. We just saw these people take down the World Trade Centers and people have died and we're being attacked. OK, this guy, he's going to take care of us. Yeah.  And you don't get that feeling with Trump at all? No.  Trump is like I mean, it's like he's just in his own feedback loop. So whatever he can do to make himself feel good, he's going to do it. And then he only understands caveman principles, which is power, strength.  Yeah. Show strength, dominance. But he doesn't believe it himself. That's the thing. It's like I know you know, that Trump for as much bolstering as he does all of this shit that he says, I swear to God, if he was in a room with someone who is just like you're talking about this tough guy stuff, let's go right now, he would be cowering in a corner.  There's no he can't back up any of the stuff. All of his. It's just it's just hot to be a great episode of Black Mirror. Oh, my God. Yeah, I know, right? We agree it would have to be like a guy who's like a guy who he's insulted, but that's like unassuming who fucks him up.  You know, we'd have to be you'd have to be Justin Trudeau because he's like Justin Trudeau, the social justice warrior guy. And yeah.  And he's a handsome fellow with a beautiful, thick head of hair. Yeah.  If if all sudden Trump wakes up and he's in like MMD shorts. Yes. His big man boobs. Yeah, totally.  And they're putting in like they're put in the mouth guard. OK, so this is what you get. What am I, am I, am I Justin Trudeau. Just like stretching out doing these crazy kickstarts fucking him up.  I know. Better yet it would be a woman. Oh that would be that would be amazing. Some badass woman who fucks him up. Yeah. Some woman president of Nigeria or some shit totally starts kick his ass.  Oh my God. And making fun of them while she fighting. I mean totally. I mean that's the thing.  It's like, you know, I think we just got the rule. Oh man.  Look, if you have to fight someone like if you wanted your government to fight, how about better yet, we break it down to one versus one and the best controlled situation where we're going to lose the least amount of life. Yeah, you challenge to a duel. You're the other person from the other country.  I'm so down with that. I remember there was a science fiction story, I think maybe in the 80s or it was like in the 80s or the 70s and it was about that. It was like in the future world leaders would just fight each other. So we'd have a real problem with Putin.  He'd fuck everybody up because he'd be the master cheater.  Well, he knows how to fight. He's a black belt in judo. Oh, is a jet black belt. Yeah, he's very good. All right. You seeing videos of him now? Yeah. See if you can find videos of Putin doing judo.  He's very he's very good. He trains with legit guys to seems like they kind of let him get around a little bit.  A little cigale very sick. All right.  But when you look at his movements, he's clearly skilled, is very skilled.  There's no doubt about it. He absolutely knows what he's doing. Here he goes. See, this is him working out with the Russian judo team, like that guy.  That was a little weird the way he felt. No, no, no. I meant that was a legit move. That's a legit move. It seems so, so effortless. It's just a simple sweep. He he what these they're doing right now is they're grabbing he's got a little fucking problem with them.  They're grabbing each other. They're just going to take his thumb up there, grabbing each other's guys and they're moving each other around. They try to redirect like that.  OK, that looked at the other one just felt a little weird. It looks weird because it's it's it's funny how easy it is for someone to throw you to the ground if they just sweep out your foot like a little high step warm up.  It does look like it's actually a good way to get that. My dad is a judo. He's a brown belt in judo.  Well, when I watch him maneuver, like there's no doubt about it, he's skinny. Yeah, no, I mean, obviously he trains. Yeah. But I mean, if we got Trump up we'd have a real problem. Yeah we would, we'd all be speaking Russian.  I mean Trump would probably get taken out with like one slap, an open handed slap to his face and he would probably start crying.  Well, I don't know about that. You know, you'd have to, you'd have to slap around. You probably just his tear up and you panic. Yeah.  Just get it wet. Yeah. A bucket of water on his head like it's.  No, so he's he's working out with the real Russian judo team though. I mean and he's like fucking sixty something years old.  That's that's pretty cool. Just kind of crazy.  I mean, I mean, I mean on a on a human I need to accomplish something, a level that's that's you know, that's good.  We know that there's something you know, I was asked today the Maria Bamford had a questionnaire. Twenty five questions that you're supposed to answer for a certain column or something like that. And and one of the questions is like, did you learn something from someone that you didn't like? And in a way, like in that video, it's like, well, I don't really I don't like Putin, but it shows that, you know what? It's sixty years old.  You can still you can still train with the best of them. And, you know, and you put yourself he's putting himself out there and he's going for it, sort of.  But again, it's hard to imagine that those guys weren't kind of like taking it easy.  Yeah, I think that they were taking it easy because it's I mean, how could you not imagine being the guy that, like, takes hip, toss them on his head?  Yeah. And you wind up dead. Yeah. And then you just be like he'd be like, all right. Yeah. You got me. Seems all friendly at first. And then like a week later you're like in a gulag. Yeah.  You just slowly get poisoned to death over months. Did you you ever hear the story about him with Robert Kraft, with the Super Bowl ring? No. Sergel Simpson actually told me the story. It's a crazy story.  Yeah, he he was with Robert Kraft when Robert Kraft was was there. He had a Super Bowl ring on and he said, let me see your ring. Let me hold.  He puts it takes the ring. And he puts it on his finger and then just walks away. And then Robert Kraft is like, hey, what the fuck? And then, you know, the security guards put their hand on crap, like shake his hand like.  No, like the scissoring now. Wow. He just in front of everybody took his fucking ring. Look, there it is right here. You see it like he puts it on his finger, he puts it in his finger, looks and is like and then Kraft tries to get it back is like, no, that's mine.  I'm going to keep that. Oh my God. Yeah.  Oh, what a man stole his fucking Super Bowl ring, but he put it on and just walked away.  What an asshole. But weird. I mean, it's it's a power move. It's just a big dick. It's yeah. It's totally just like, hey, check this out.  I just whipped his hog out in front of everybody. The thing that sucks and say that, what does that quote right there? I took three shows to Putin. He put it on and he goes, I can kill someone with this ring.  And that was it. That's all I took it. Yeah. I put my hand out, he put it in his pocket. Three KGB guys got around him and walked out. Oh, that that sucks, man.  With it. It's weird to fucking that. That just sucks.  It's such a crazy thing to do in front of everybody.  I mean, I get it. It's like that's like, you know, that's like the thing like, you know, people like like Bosna or Pulcinella or Trump or any of these like kind of strong arm, you know, they, they think that that's the way that you do it.  That's how because when you don't have creativity and you don't have a connection to empathy, you make up for it in other ways.  And so in this particular case, it's like, well, I'm just going to do strong arm shit because I because I can and I do in front of everybody and do it in front of a flashing.  And just because that's how you do it. I did growing. It's like this is the way kill people with this thing. Yeah.  This is the way you do it. You do it. This is power. Eventually it's him going like this is how power works. We're crazy thing to say.  The guy I could kill someone with this ring. I wonder if he did.  I wonder if he killed somebody with it. You know, he's definitely killed people. So I wonder for sure. Ever killed somebody with that Robert Kraft Super Bowl ring.  Oh man, I yeah. I mean, that guy, that damn it. I just I so I just wish I just hope that humanity we could pull out of it, man.  I hope that we can like go. You know what.  Look what he's saying. But Mr. Kraft is saying no is weird. Dmitry Peskov said I was standing 20 meters away from him and Mr. Putin and saw and heard how Mr. Kraft gave this ring as a gift.  Oh, my gosh. Insane. Insane. That's like they give you know, once that got once the KGB guy was like, now it's like, you know, it's over.  Yeah. You know that it's over. You're not getting your shit back.  He said is a it's a humorous anecdote that Kraft retells for laughs. He loves that the ring is in the Kremlin. And as he stated back in 2005, he continues to have a great respect for Russia and the leadership of President Putin.  Oh, my Lord, says Stacy James, a spokesman for the Kraft Group. I don't trust dudes who are named Stacy because they're real.  They're real. What about Keach? Stacy Keach? Yeah, but he was born in the forties, OK?  Things were different back then. You could have a gay old. Things are different for Stacie's. You could have a good time. Charlie Sheen. There was rumors that Charlie Sheen bought the ring, but the not.  Sorry. Oh, I was just. Oh, it's just a it's just a story about in the mix lost rings with celebrity.  Charlie Sheen was a big 9/11 truth her. He even wrote an open letter to Obama demanding that they come clean about what really happened during 9/11. Yeah, it was he was one of them. 9/11 was an inside job, guys.  Man, it just goes to show you like. Yeah, celebrity man. Like, it's I swear to God, it's like the platform is a documentary.  He's in a movie with Whoopi Goldberg called 911 that came out a couple of years ago. But a couple of years ago, twenty seventeen was called the fuck up.  Whoopi Goldberg was like, oh, so this is a movie about recreational hyram in the tower doing coke will be where did this come out?  What is this? This is a three year old movie, one oh oh oh.  Well, he's looking at this. Oh, my God. September eleventh. It's about to go down. Oh, Jesus. Oh, this looks like maybe the worst movie of all time.  First of all, what did they do to whip his hair now? They took his dreadlocks. They stuffed him in the most unimaginable wig.  They must be like, yeah, that she's like recreating a role.  Somebody that is insane.  What's crazy about Charlie is Charlie Sheen would be so crazy here.  Charlie, at one point in time was a super legit actor like in Platoon. That was in some fantastic movies.  Yeah, he was in Hot Shots. I don't know if that was as good.  Major League, the Hot Shots in Spider Man, I mean, come on, bad, but I mean now like we kind of all agree that he's just a fucking loon.  He's a crazy person.  Now, I don't you know, it's it's so obvious following it. Oh, they're fucked. Oh. Damn boy, 911, 911 Corera for us September 8th, oh, Jesus, just so you could hear about it before the 11th comes around, you get worked up that we should have a viewing party for that movie and smoke a pound of weed.  Oh, hell, yeah.  And watch that invite that invited me to that.  You're in my I wonder, did you think do you think do you think 9/11 like when 9/11 happened, that Porsche had to rebrand, but what did they do?  They then give a fuck do. Sorry German sorry.  Yes I'm sorry but all of us named very early so has been named this since nineteen sixty something. Yeah. So yeah.  No Man's Land. He had a movie about Porsches. It's coming up too. Oh my God. Who is Allah dude. The other dude. Oh I know that tweeny. Yeah. Yeah he was like an eighties dude. Yes he was one of them eighties guys might have been in the race.  He probably made a ton of movie money and now he lives on a ranch somewhere in Wyoming or some shit that's so crazy but that no man's land is about D.B. Sweeney is a cop and Charlie Sheen is a Porsche thief and he only steals Porsches. And they said, what about Ferrari?  Like Italian trash? Oh, my lord, I'm still trying to be car thief.  And it's a weird time for Porsches, too, because they kind of sucked. Yeah, it's like they're stealing those eighties Porsche sort of you because the tire sucked and you know, I'm forty four and. Well, no they're not. They're all nine eleven. But like those, all those old 9/11 Turbo's like they have that lift throttle oversteer. If you never drove an old one. No, never. I have one out there that has a little bit of it.  I have a nine six four. It's an R America but it's pretty gripping. It's got really good tires and an upgraded suspension. There it is is the movie.  But those old ones, he's obviously when you're going around a corner, you have to stay on the gas.  Oh, you can't let off the gas if you go around the corner or they get something called lift throttle oversteer. So as you lift off the throttle, yeah, the car will oversteer.  And many a dude lost their lives because they're the assen kicked out because they didn't know how to drive these cars correctly. Now you know how to drive the car correctly. You can actually manage that oversteer. There's something about those old cars. Yeah. Once you learn how to drive them. And I'm by no means an expert in how to drive those old cars. But there's something about that sliding that you know how to time. So you know how to time that slot and actually get you into these corners better.  You kind of manipulate that weight.  It's like a it's like a light form of drifting. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Like a national manager. Yeah, yeah. I never learned how to do it, but I have experienced that in my nine six four going around a corner. You let off the gas, it's like hey fact it gets I'll slop it just like your fucking your controls like we have.  We had it all fucking fucks off on you SpongeBob virtuously like this gets real slow.  It just feels like it's, you don't have it anymore and you're like oh my God, I'm a crash now and then you like recorrect like if you ever like half a BMW, a two thousand and five e forty six and three. Yeah. It's a great car. It's not the fastest car in the world but it's really, really balanced.  What is it. Three series five three three zero three two and three. It's around three.  It's, it's a great year, but it's a really it's a very mechanical car. Like when you're shifting it everything, you feel really connected to the car. Yeah. And but when you go around a corner with this, it's the ascent kicks out you correct. Really easy. Yeah. It feels like your you got it. You're in control.  Let us cross. Right and it comes back in. But you also you could feel like what's going on. Like you feel when it slips away a little bit if you feel very in control of it like you could if you took it around a racetrack and you start sliding and drifting a little bit, you'd have it really quickly. Like, yeah, there's a shitload of up M three forty six Dreft.  There's like porn like drift porn all over you two of guys taking these cars and going like famously well-balanced. But it's, it's just a really well engineered, well balanced car. But it's front engine, you know, it's, it's, it's built different.  That rear engine Porsche like especially look at these guys, it taking these things, these guys like going sideways around these corners.  So many people love these cars for that very reason. There's this one crazy video of this guy on a loading dock and it's not very wide, but this guy is drifting sideways and spinning around on this loading dock like look at, well, this guy is handling this, but this is about this car.  These cars are Datsun six. But oh, my lord.  But these cars are like really easy to maneuver. They're so controlled.  Easy drifters. Yeah, it's just about. Amazing car. That's that's a beautiful forty six right there. Wow, that's. But these cars, you can, when they spin, when they ascend, spins you just correct. And you can you can handle it and use it to drift around cones like this guy is doing. Man, I.  Have you seen hyperdrive on Netflix. No. What is that? It's like a drifting competition, but they they like, set up this course on an old, like, abandoned factory.  Oh, wow. And and it's it kind of reminds me.  What's that inside? No, it's all outside.  It's like a big outside, like machinery, kind of like, you know, towers, everything. And they have these drivers from all over the world, Germany, Japan. It's like Cannonball Run. Remember Cannonball Run from the 80s, the movie. Wow. So there's like all these, like racers. There's a husband, wife, German team.  They each drive their own car. There's a couple of guys from Japan, a bunch of brasileiro, some guys from Brazil, Americans. This woman from Florida who I follow on Instagram, who's bad ass, she had a really amazing run. And women, men, people have not a lot of people of color, but like definitely like a pretty diverse crew from all over the world.  They're going up this giant ramp they have to balance. So you have to keep going back and forth until you find the balance point. Then it turns green. Once it turns green, then you can go forward on the course. And almost everybody lost it.  But all these people, they're they're so sick, some of the best drivers in the world.  But the thing that really brought a tear to my eye was that they're all rooting for each other, like all of them are rooting for each other because there's never been a thing like it. And I mean, there's definitely drift competitions, but there's never been a thing like this.  And Executive Bruce is wrong. Yeah. Yeah. What is she? But I think she's just I think she's just in it. She's a freak. Yes, Max. Yeah, I remember Mad Max. Yeah.  So I'm sure someone approached her about it and she liked cars enough to like, you know, put her name on to it. But it's watch this thing. You'll love it. It's some of the best driving precision driving I've ever seen.  I have a boner.  It's it's it's so it's so crazy.  And they're like killing it. And the thing is, they can't repair their cars. So I mean, they can patch them up between runs, but they can't modify, they can't bring in like new parts and stuff.  So what about tires. They're really tires.  I think tires between between the different courses you can change stuff.  But I think like during the race, like and then there's like another race right after that, like I think you can do some patch up stuff. There's like this French dude, he had a car that just would not fucking die. What was it. It's just want to I think it was a French car.  I think it was a I think it might have been a Renault.  I don't know if it was a Renault. Might have been a citoyen. I don't know if it was one of those. Is like is I was on a date with a girl.  I'd be very excited. I say reject the ticket. I think my sculpture DNC twin probably reads as it comes, but he watches movies with reading it.  Yeah. Read the words I can subtitle and see the imagery at the same time. That's crazy. I know. I know. Let's go have some wine in a park all the way from where do they have a specific kind of car that dominates these things.  Is it like smaller sports cars? Are these muscle cars at all?  It's it's everything like the the kind of the favorite Brazil guy. There were two Brazil racers, actually, a really young guy who was like his he and his father have this amazing relationship and he's super regimented and strict about his training and stuff like that.  And then this other dude, who's his friend that that the that he taught the younger guy how to drift.  So it's interesting. They know each other and they're competing against each other. But the guy, the older guy, he was this cowboy hat and he got he wrecked his car and didn't have enough money to build a new car for drifting like years and years ago. So it was like a big deal for him to, like, put a car together.  But it's like I forget what it is. But it's a monster American car.  It's like it's oh, it's right there. That might be a Dodge Charger. Yeah. I don't know what the fuck that is to say that I just don't I just don't remember. Yes. It's got the right guy. I should have a roadrunner on the sides. Don't Jeff Tweedy. Yeah, well they put a crazy fin on the back of it. Yeah. Yeah.  But he I guess that's probably he's a monster then. Yeah it is. It is functional but he, he was and that car. And so you're talking about going through shipping containers. It's a big card with three inches of room on either side. And he was bombing them and like didn't lose his rearview mirror.  A side view mirrors this. Yeah. Look at that thing. There's shit that's where you're going to like. There's going to definitely be some tears shed because some of the shit that people pull off on this race and it's anybody's race because sometimes, like, you know, I forget the woman from Florida, but, you know, she killed it on one of her runs. And I was like, oh, my God, she's going to go really, really far.  And then she just had car problem. They had problems with, like a pressurized hose system that's supposed to hit the car if you don't clear a certain thing.  Guys fucking drifting on the snowy road in. Charger. Oh, my God, look at all the snow and ice. This is so unpredictable. Yeah, it's a monster. Grab him and hug him and say, cut that one off.  Yeah, I cut that disgusting wing.  Oh, he drifted his way into a tunnel bonus. My God, that's so dangerous.  You're going to you're going to lose your mind over that show because I can't wait for the second season. You're going to talk drifting. You've got to talk. Ken Block, have you ever seen that Huennekens shit that he did with that Mustang? No.  Oh, my God, no. Black is the most insane. I want to say as a 65 Mustang somewhere, I think it's one of the earlier generation Mustangs and it's like the most ridiculously modified Mustang. Scott. There it is. Look at this fucking thing.  There might actually be a 67.  OK, see you there with Matt LeBlanc, who just read Matt LeBlanc, who trivia grew up in the same town as me. Oh, really? Yeah. Newton, Massachusetts. Shout out to Matt.  I used to hear about him because he dated girls on man.  Look at that car, man. So Ken Block has this fucking ridiculous car like super. I think it's a four wheel drive car, too. And he's got these crazy shifter's and these brakes and shit.  Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Those big ass man, you you you're going to get a kick. These guys are like doing that shit.  But on a course that's insane.  There's a dude classic again Cannonball Run shit. This white dude Lamborghini Hurrican I believe. Whoa. Makes it four wheel drive or.  No it's a four wheel drive car. He modifies it so that he can turn off four wheel drive. So make it four wheel drive or rear wheel drive, four different events.  So his take was that he was going to check out everything. And when he went on runs.  Yeah, like the auto fold mirrors. So he'd fold in his mirrors so he wouldn't break his mirrors. Oh my God. And all this shit. And he actually made it quite a ways, but it was like the Japanese team in Cannonball Run, they had like that crazy checked out car or whatever.  It's me and I had such a blast.  So that's that's a fun looking show, man. It's funny you talking about Brazil. Did you ever watch that documentary on Ayrton Senna? Oh, yes.  Oh, yeah. Yeah.  Amazing, right, man. Racing spirit man.  Do that documentary shows you like what fine line exists between being the very best and someone who dies in a crash. Yes, it's so they're riding this fucking razor edge of performance.  And Ayrton Senna was famous for having these spectacular instincts but ultimately died in the crash.  Yeah, I mean, and unfortunately, you know, fortunately, unfortunately, unfortunately, he had the crash, but then they changed so much, you know, because the Pacers were complaining about, like, how dangerous it was.  Well, he was responsible in some way for the design of the NSX. Oh, really? Yeah. They had an Ayrton Senna version of the NSX that didn't have a sunroof. It had a solid fixed roof. And I think they did some different modifications to the suspension.  It's kind of crazy when you look at it.  You know, we were talking about cars earlier before we started the show. And modern sports cars are so goddamn fast. They have so much horsepower. But the NSX, when it came out, I think I want to say that two hundred and seventy five horsepower, that's a lot for a tiny car that wasn't that big of a go slow, bro.  Trust me, I had one slow. I think. I think. But that's the first that's the Ayrton Senna version.  Oh.  Yeah, so that's. Look at that. I want to say this is like early 90s. Well, it's it's flip windows or flip lights, so it is an earlier version of it.  That's crazy. Yeah, I think my my. Oh, no, I was thinking of Acura Integra.  That seems like it's got a body kit that's, you know, a huge body, kitty, kitty. There's that second intake on the bottom. And then there's the side skirts that were added and it's been.  Yeah. And then the hood. That's not the now that's a supertax. Someone's someone went crazy with that one. Yeah, but those Cindi's.  Yeah. Those they are still you can still find them. They're all red. They're all red with a black black roof and you can still find them for sale. They're obscenely expensive now. They're fun. A great little car though. There's something about those cars too. You feel like you're on like a jet because the way the cockpit sits. Yeah, it's very purpose driven. Yeah, really great car. I had two of them actually. Oh wow.  Yeah.  I had one with the flip up lights and then there he is, Weirton Santa. What do you think of the new NSX? It's great.  It's a great car, but it's not the same thing. Yeah, it gets a supercar with four wheel drive and a hybrid engine and it's got electric engines, electric motors and a gasoline engine. It's spectacularly fast. Yeah, but the old NSX was an aluminum car that was rear wheel drive, mid engine six speed.  Wow. And it was an amazing racer, little light car.  I want to say it was like twenty four hundred pounds or something. Really. Like crazy. Yeah. Crazy light like aluminum. Yeah. No.  And that's why with that two hundred and seventy five horsepower engine, you know, for the time it was a quick car but it was like the Japanese answer to Ferrari because Ferraris were beautiful but they fucking brake like crazy because my people make them do what my people engineering their fucking animals and all those fucking pasta chips designing your shit.  You made me the way it looks, but then you handed over to a German guy or a Japanese person, and they don't know this one thing. So the Japanese are like, we got to do just sit down.  We're going to see what you're doing. So, you know. Yeah. And we're going to make one that doesn't break. Yeah.  I mean, I love those challenges back and forth. I mean, you know, I love that. I saw that finally saw that Ford Ferrari movie. I still haven't seen it. I was glad I saw it.  I know they took some liberties here and there, but yeah, kind of a cool lesson in my decisions that companies make about emotional products, you know, and also just like, you know, dudes being dudes or whatever, like, well, we're going to be getting creative release is going directly to the Italians, you know, and then and then them like changing their, you know, like the Italians going, like, I have changed my mind.  They're going to other company, you know, whatever it's it's the whole thing is very obviously very dramatic. But it is wonderful to see what can happen if people just put their heads together and go, you know what?  We're going to fucking create a sick race car right now and we're going to get an amazing team together. We're going to put it together.  And, you know, and the modern GT is is gorgeous. It's a it was a car that I wanted for a long time.  The modern GT, especially the light version, the all carbon fiber version of it.  And you can buy one with like a million dollars there. They're too much. They have to, like, go into the special thing where you have to like you have to know somebody who gets it and now you get them.  Because the two year expiration date has passed, you could actually get them on the resale market. Oh, yeah. This one for sale like a mile away from here. We'll look at it. I don't know. I'm happy with my too expensive. Yeah. My car is like, yes, I'm very happy with it now. You have a beautiful car. It's a it's a good thing. And I like my Tesla too, which is I drive most of the time.  Do you tell people what your other cars that we're talking about, are we going to keep history? You see, like I loved the car for the first time on national TV now.  I mean, yeah, we can say what it is. I mean, it's it's been it it's kind of a car that means a lot to me because we're a weird thing. My dad was a car dude and I never understood it. Oh, really? Yeah. Yeah.  My mom like, told me stories about like basically when he met her, he had an opal as a kind of a cheap opal and then he ended up buying a Pontiac Firebird.  That was I forget what color it was, but it was a it was a it's a type of green.  Anyways, he had this amazing American sports car in Europe and everyone was freaking out over it and he had that. And then his second car was a I can't remember what what this was. The third car was. But then his car after that was a Chrysler Cordoba, which was kind of just like a classy chill. Kind of. Yeah, like a luxury sedan. That's what it was. But it was a it was still two Taurus was luxury coupe.  I guess he had that and he loved cars. And I just didn't put that together. And then so then when I finally got my stuff together and I had enough credit thanks to my business managers and knock on wood.  I had enough credit where this car that I have only only it cost me very little money, I was like 5000 dollars to get into it.  What? Yeah. How is that possible? I don't know. But that's how a thousand dollars down payment and the pay per month.  Yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. So that car is not a five dollars. Somebody is lying you know, that's another car. Let me look at your books. Oh my God.  Damn Reggie Joe Rogan.  Somebody you me is how much it costs 5000 dollars.  Your manager's a creep. Well, cocaine in your car.  Well maybe it's a Porsche 911 of your era for S. nine nine two. The new one. It's a dope car. I'm very impressed with it. This is the first time I've seen one of the new ones in person.  It's and I was saying that your car is it's it's not understated, but it's it is compared to like the Turbo s, but it's like the perfect amount of sleek design, but like slightly compared to a car for the amount of performance that that car has under the hood. Yeah. Or under the bonnet I guess you would say the rear as they say, the bonnet and I guess I don't know what they call it.  Well there is no there's no there's no back. There's a British call the front.  Right. The bonnet is the front. Yes. Right. The boot is the trunk. But it's on a boot. But it's not a boot.  And you can't see it. You can't see the engine on. Oh yeah. I like two fans. Yeah, it's two fans. That's it. So you have the four. Yes, it is a fucking beautiful car man. But it's like it's so sleek yet understated. Yeah.  It's super sexy. It's really weird. Like sometimes I look at it and I'm like that looks pretty bad ass.  And then the other night I had it parked at night and I showed my friend, we walked up to it and it just looks so crazy, sexy, like in a way that I'm not used to feeling about a car.  But it feels. But it but it was built.  It was I do say I get feels it was it was built in the town I was born and it was built in Stuttgart or sorry that Porsche is from Stuttgart. I think it was actually built in another village.  But some of them have the big fat single exhaust tips, the two tips and then yours has four tips.  That's the sports exhaust. I kind of like the way yours looks better. Yeah, it's weird. I thought that I ordered there's a couple things that I didn't include in the spec that I thought I did, so they didn't come. But I'm actually glad that I didn't get them. But the sports car exhaust was one and I realized sports exhaust doesn't give you any performance.  It just makes and makes it louder, which I didn't really understand. I that sports exhausted must like get rid of it must exhaust better.  Just makes you more obnoxious person. Yeah. And I'm glad because I don't want to attract attention. So beautiful car man.  It's great. Oh well engineered man. There's so many things you were telling me that it does that I didn't know. Like the night vision shit.  Yeah. The surround view when you're backing up that's a life saver.  I've always wanted to have that in a car and it has tech that all cars should have, you know, I mean, the way I view it is like, you know, I wanted to drive a Porsche because everybody who drives Porsche always does the same thing. It's the benchmark. It's like it's a drivers car. It's a bit, you know, I have to say like that, bro.  Well, because because that's what it sounded like in the beginning to me, because I was like, OK, OK, OK, cool down asshole. It's like everyone going like Game of Thrones. You've got to see Game of Thrones, which is I still I haven't seen it. I got to see it. I'm not going we're not going to talk about anything. Oh no, no. It's the greatest show in the history of the world.  Sure. OK, how dare you. I know. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry for you. I'll do it. Thank you.  But but your people were right about the Porche, but they were right as soon as I because I purposefully didn't. I never rented one. I never drove one and I never drove one until I had one. And as soon as I took my first drive like me and my assistant, because my assistant has been with me for like 12 years and and she helped me, you know, that's a big leap.  So you just buy it. Live it test-Drive. I didn't test drive it because when people speak enough about this, you know, push, push, push, push, push, push, they're not lying like they're not they're no one's making that shit up.  And so and I should talk to someone who's really into Scientology. You might be right. There's a lot of people that are Inderjit shit. That's nonsense. Yeah, but this is not a nonsense car. That's a masterful piece of engineering.  Yeah, it's I mean, they drove from Montana down to L.A. and I thought I was going to be uncomfortable. You know, I was like, that's a sports car.  It's going to be uncomfortable because I had it editress before this and that had the track suspension and that was an unforgiving suspension.  Everywhere you went, you were like, you know, you just getting thrown all over the place. Yeah. And and this this car so civilized.  And when you're on the road, you're like, I can do anything but I'm just going to chill like like for me, I just kind of set my cruise control. That's the other thing.  It has adaptive cruise control, which is a very, very important thing when it comes to any car, really, but a sports car especially. And I didn't have in the TTR. So if you're in bumper to bumper traffic, you're just paddling back and forth, paddling back and forth and it sucks. But with the Porsche, I just said it, you know, and just cruise and they had Greenkeeper said. You have a tussler, I have a Tesla.  Yeah, but doesn't your Tesla do that too well? Tesla does auto pilot, that is a whole nother leg that's home. That's my favorite. That's my absolute favorite.  I love it when I come home from the Comedy Store and it's late at night. That is the move. Yes. I love it.  You're tired. Yeah. I feel like driving as a couple of fingers on that thing and trying to pay attention. I pay attention, but yeah.  You don't get it. Go on. Just to do. Yes, let it just let it take over. It's so sweet.  It really, really. I mean I've been using autopilot for probably 70 percent of my drives for since it came out.  And there's some new upgrade that I got, but I haven't done anything to it since. Some new upgrade like full autopilot.  Yeah, that does. I did that too. Yeah. It's not really doing a lot right now yet. It's starting to recognize traffic lights.  So you will get a warning when the traffic lights are turning yellow to red. They'll be that that's the beginning of that. And then there's a couple other things like stop sign, like physical stop sign. It can read, oh, there's a stop sign, things like that. But nothing is automated.  Those are not their only recognition things. Oh, so right now it's recognizing things that it could be active in, but it's not doing it.  Hmm. Interesting. Yeah. I love I love autopilot. I mean I will say with the course, that's my last gas car that I'm going to get. I just wanted to like experience it and know what it's about. And then I'm going to probably move on to, I don't know, something or maybe I'll just, you know, something will happen in the world will completely change and they'll have no access to my resources. And I'll just go back to just gardening.  But yeah. And you might have to get an axe. Yeah. I think to start a fire with two sticks. Yeah.  You know, but I grew up as a Boy Scout. I'm ready man. You know, it's like that. What is that Einstein quote. I don't know what weapons they're going to use in World War Three, but World War Four will be fought with sticks.  Oh, I love that. It's beautiful. That's totally true.  I mean, we're going to see men are going to see they're fighting this with rocks.  Yeah, I know. Yeah. With provided rocks. Yeah.  Yeah. It's like are they. They're trying to corporate. I don't.  Oh I'm not gonna go back. I'm so confused.  All I know is I'm going to do my best to promote peace and love, peace and love and understanding and education, education, education.  This is the perfect storm with all these people out of work. You know, like I think that was ultimately extremely irresponsible to to just shut the economy down for as long as they did. I think it's a terrible idea. I think it creates unrest. It I mean, when you see unrest in all these these countries, you're not seeing it in rich communities. You're not seeing people in Calabasas like lashing out. It's on a Beverly Hills thing. It's the things that happen when people don't have anything.  What you greatly increase the amount of people that are fucked.  And then you've thrown this horrific circumstance where we all get to watch a video, someone being murdered by a cop. All these other cops sit around and watch. And then this is all compounded by all these videos. There's a video that I tweeted where this fucking guy is at a stoplight and these Denver cops are shooting his car with pepper gas. And he's like, hey, man, my fucking pregnant girlfriends in this car. Are you fucking guys really shit?  I'm like, I'm not a criminal. And so they keep shooting it. They shoot at his car more so as he's sitting there in his car, they're shooting pepper canisters, whatever the fuck happened. Yeah, shooting pepper spray at his fucking car. Yeah. What are you doing?  What do you do? So many videos. These cops doing horrible shit during this time and they know that they're being filmed. This is really crazy to me.  They think they're protected because they're wearing riot gear. No one could recognize them. Look at this. So these guys are standing there. Give me a volume on this. You could hear this fucking guy can hear.  Yeah. Are you fucking with me? I don't know what they're shooting tear gas at his car, like by the pregnant woman in the car.  First of all, you're being a fucking moron because this pregnant woman is in the car and you're asking them to shoot you. I know. And that's he's definitely exacerbating it.  But at the same time, there should be not doing that at all. At all.  Because there's no reason this is not like this guy's a threat to humanity. He's not a threat. He's he's just he's just impassioned and he's loud and he's saying stuff. And it's like they've got all the gear. They have to show the restraint.  They're having fun shooting in a car with a pregnant woman inside. But just the fact they knew that there's a pregnant woman inside of it, it's just insane to me.  I mean, someone should have gone over there like the. Fuckin sheriff from Flint, you talk to him, apologized, yes, and then keep the keep the car moving. The problem is, you know, my friend Tim Kennedy was tweeting this, that there needs to be some he's a Ranger Special Forces guy, and he used to fight in the UFC and he tweeted, that needs to be some sort of a fundamental change in how we train law enforcement.  Exactly. And I think the way they train, like if you if you go through Buddz, if you become a Navy SEAL or be exceptional, you have to be an exceptional human being to get through that. And that's the way they weed out the people that can't cut it. Yeah, that's how they do it. Yeah, but they don't do that for the cops.  The cops, it's far easier. And you're, you know, you're around civilian life, you're around see cities and urban areas and you're dealing with constant conflict. And so you don't weed out the people, you actually actively recruit people. I remember driving down Sunset Boulevard to talking about the great, great pay that you could get being a Los Angeles police officer because nobody wanted to be a cop in L.A. fucking advertising like, hey, why don't you work at Chipotle?  Hey, why don't you be a cop and get shot at like it's fucking crazy. Like, it's just like it's in the same line as like, you know, working at the farmer's market. So you can also be a police officer.  Yeah. And look, there's look, there are great cops, man. They're great cops is great people out there because it's a hard job and it is not for everybody. It's a hard job.  It's not for everybody. And they just need to do a better job of training and weeding out. You really, really need to do. And they need to make it.  They need to make their officers accountable and not be afraid to like us.  You know, so-and-so is blah, blah, blah, blah. It's like, oh, no, that's a snitch or whatever, or we're going to fucking demote you or we're going to put you on traffic duty or whatever.  It's like that shit needs to stop.  It's like take your job seriously, man. And it's existed across the board. It's been there forever. Did you ever see the documentary The Seventy Five? No. It's a documentary about corrupt cops in New York. Yeah, fucking amazing. It's amazing.  The guy who was the head guy in the seventy five that we had on the podcast. Mike Dowd. Yeah. Mike Dout. Mike Dowd, who's a great guy who's a real piece of shit back in the day.  Right. But owns it and talks about it. I mean, he was driving a Corvette and selling drugs and helping drug dealers, but I mean, like shit that you wouldn't believe it was in a movie and it was all real.  And the the film documents, all of it.  It is madness. I mean, top to bottom, beginning to end madness. When you watch the documentary, you watch at the end, you're fucking sweating and you're like, holy shit.  Like these guys were living like this, selling coke, robbing drug dealers, coming out of there with bags of cash like crazy. Oh, my God. I mean, cops and now cops. And now I know and I talked to my friend Scottie. Scottie reads or back in the day, he was just like saying like I was in SWAT and 70s in L.A. and we were part of the first league of SWAT.  And it's like the shit that people would do that he would see in the department all the time and what they had to deal with. And then there were all those purges that happened throughout the years. You know, once in a while there'd be this corruption thing and then they would just have to fucking let go.  Well, how about the Rampart unit, right? Didn't they disband that? What was the Rampart unit? That was the people that they they suspected someone from the Rampart unit of killing Biggie.  They think that, yeah, there was a crazy Rolling Stone article about that. Someone paid him off and they they suggested it was schook night that was involved.  Oh, my God, that's crazy. Yeah. Well, you know, the police department needs to police itself the ultimate police corruption, documentaries, cocaine, cowboys. Have you seen that? Oh, I've heard of that. Yeah.  Oh, my goodness. Cocaine cowboys and cocaine cowboys to my probably my top ten of all time favorite documentaries that Billy Corben, the director of on the podcast several times. He also made Screwball that recent documentary on A-Rod. It's all about steroids.  It's genius because he used little kids to play A-Rod and all the other people in the movie and as a recreation. Oh, my little it's it's a genius movie.  Oh, my God, it's screwball. Yeah, it's it's a genius movie.  Billy's a brilliant, brilliant guy, and he's one of those rare, really intelligent, proud Floridians like really intelligent guy. He loves Miami. He's like a he's a Grandpre. That's a very, very rare breed.  But cocaine cowboys, one and two are so goddamn good and so crazy. There was one year in the 80s that the entire graduating class from the police academy was either murdered or went to jail for corruption.  The entire graduating class, they were all on the take.  Everyone was selling and doing coke everywhere.  Man, it's it is a fucking amazing documentary.  So insane to me. Of course, I. And of course, of course, of course, I mean, there was so much coke and so much money coming in and they were just all in the take, everybody was on the take and everybody was doing committing crimes and helping people commit crimes and hiding millions of dollars in holes in the ground in their backyard. I think to this day there's a bunch of dead people that died with millions and millions of dollars in their backyard just buried in holes.  Oh, my lords, what a crazy. And this.  Yeah, well, there were so many banks in Miami, too. That's the other thing. Like, why are so many banks here? Because they're all fucking funneling cocaine money. There's more. There were more at least at the time. There were more banks per capita in Miami than any other city in the country because they were all just funneling cocaine money and laundering it.  My gosh. I mean, come on. Yeah. I mean, it's that absolute power thing, right? Yup. Yup, yeah.  I mean, again, it comes back to the same thing. The first of all, the oversight. You can't really oversee that many people correctly.  You literally have to be like a one on one oversight to police officer, follow them everywhere.  And that's how deeply embedded the corruption was.  And I think, again, just look, I was a I was a security guard for one year and when I was 19 years old. Oh, wow. I worked at Great Woods, Great Woods in Mansfield, Massachusetts. It's like a concert center. Yeah. And all these guys from my taekwondo team got jobs working security there. So that's how I got the job. They were like, hey, you want to work? It's easy. Just come out there and I'm like, what do you have to do?  And like, I just get most of it is stopping people from bringing in booze and keeping people from doing certain shit. First day I got there. OK, do name Alleycat. Alleycat was the head security guy who ran the joint and he they caught this kid, this drunk kid stealing a golf cart because everyone would drive around the concert area and golf cart security guys would. So this drunk kid stole this golf cart. They tackled him. And I watched him beat the fuck out of this dude with a walkie talkie like beat this dude in the head with a walkie talkie.  This is my first day on the job.  So I was like, well, where did I get myself into? Because this seems like we're going to be beating people up. And within a couple of weeks of this job, we had all developed this us versus them mentality. It was very strange, right? It's like it was us versus them. It was like we were cops. Yeah.  And it was we like I saw guys who I knew that were like really nice guys, like being really shitty to patrons to cuss these people that came to see these concerts because, you know, they had just sort of developed this attitude.  And I wound up quitting because of a Neil Young concert. There was a Neil Young concert and fires broke out these because, you know, Neil Young fans are all dirtbag's sorry, folks.  But at the time at the time, in the nineteen eighties in in Boston, there was like there's a lot of fucking druggies and people that were into Neil Young that were like in the get fucked up man. And so these guys had started fires on the lawn area.  So what would the way great food. Great Woods is great for Woods is an ampitheater. So there's and there's an enclosed area and then there's a back here, there's the cheap seats, it's a lawn and the lawn area.  These dudes just started fires because it's probably getting cold out and they shut the concert down. So they had to clear out the concert. Is this it was madness and chaos. And then brawl started happening. People started fighting. And then I knew that I was probably going to come to a situation like that. I'm a very survival first type of dude. So I brought a hoodie with me and I knew that when the shit goes down, I would throw this hoodie over my fucking security outfit.  I'm out of here. Yeah. And I just quit on the job. Never got my last paycheck. I just fucking I just zipped up for you, man. Bailed. I'm like, I'm not getting in any fights and no one stabbing me. No one's hit me. I'm getting the fuck out of here. Yeah. And I drove home that night and I'm like, wow, that was an experience I did a few months as a fake cop.  And I but I but you understand I remember very clearly that even I was developing I was mad at people for not listening to me. Like I was like, hey, man, I told you, park your fucking car on the other side of the line with my car. My I talk to this contest. Yeah. It become obvious I was nineteen.  I was a moron. But there's a thing that happens when you have the power and you have control. There's a bunch of other guys with you, you know, so I have this team of goons that were with me. Right.  And this gang. And then there's these people that don't want to listen, you know? And I'm like, hey, I fucking told you to pick that up and put it over there.  And then you realize, like, we're the cops, we're the bad guys, or we're the ones in control party pooper.  That's the thing that happens when you have control. And that's a very, very, very, very, very minor control. I mean, they could have told me to fuck. Off and I wouldn't I probably would have done anything. Yes, I didn't have a gun. I didn't have a weapon. Yeah, I never beat anybody up there. There was no real thing. Right.  But there was an attitude in this attitude. I remember thinking while this is going on, oh, this is what happens. And then imagine this times a hundred and you can imagine what a weapons.  But we had clearly because there had been you know, you're dealing with drunks and you're sober. There's many times where there was assholes and we had clearly a dividing line between them and us, right?  Yes. That's that's the Dangerman. Yeah. It's so hard and it's hard when it's a complex situation like urban environments, you know, where you're like there's city streets, tall buildings, compact areas, tiny, tiny streets, winding or whatever. You know, it's different than being like a cop. And like from my hometown in Great Falls, like you're just cruising around a cruiser and you can see pretty clearly in every direction.  And it's laid out like a grid call comes in and someone stole a chicken. Yeah. And you just think, oh, background check. That's probably that's probably all. Hank Swensson, if I was making that chicken stealing son of a gun, you know, or it's a meth, you know, some meth kid that's like standing in the middle of traffic or something like that or something like that.  But it's just totally different rules. And not only that, but everything is so oh, it's so it's so hard to, like, feel like you can communicate with police officers.  There's never a time when I get pulled over and I know police officers, but I get pulled over and just immediately terrified and also because I'm a black man. So, like, my immediate thing is like, OK, so keep the hands on my wheel.  The windows are rolled down all the way. My my license is already I'm not reaching for anything when they're approaching.  I'm thinking about all of that stuff happening, which which sucks because I'm sure some officers, if they knew that that's the way I felt they would hate that. Yeah. Because for them they're like, I'm just stopping you because this or or whatever.  I don't want to be that person. I know that for those officers that feel that way, it's going to be tough. But they really need to like they need to be the ones that are the majority or at least that are made known to be the majority.  And then from the cop's perspective, anyone you pull over could be the guy that shoots you. Of course, anyone you might get there could be some guy who's out on a warrant and. Yeah, and, you know, you don't know if you're ever going to see your family again. Yeah. Also, I think there's a giant percentage of them that are dealing with just crippling PTSD.  Yeah, there's there's definitely PTSD and there's also a lack of communication to civilians to be able to also pre- pretty escalate, you know, because so many videos that I watch, those dash cam footage is of people saying, like, you know, a cop coming up to the window saying license and registration.  And then their immediate thing is what what are you pulling me over for? And then the cop is like, can I just have your license and registration?  And then they keep doing that, whether they have the legal right, which I believe they actually do have the legal right to ask for why you're being pulled over, why take the risk? Yeah, you know, the cop just wants to get the information and do their job and whether they can do that or not. If you have it on camera, you've got on camera. Their conduct is on there anyways. Right. So, you know, and then what I tell everybody, it's like just survive.  That's that's that's that's what you need to do. And that goes for anybody, whether you're white, black woman, whatever it's like in general, like the attitude is like survive this, make the officer feel safe and survive it.  You're not going to arbitrate it in that moment. Yeah. Be be polite. Be respectful.  Yeah. Get it over with. And you still could run into the wrong cop.  You can still run into the wrong cop. There's no doubt about it. No doubt about it. But it's hard, you know, but you have to hold the line.  That's it's harder when everything is against you and when everyone's expecting you to do the wrong thing.  Well, one thing that's a positive trend and this is not something that, you know, it's not something that people really even want to discuss after someone gets murdered by the cops.  There has been a distinct drop in people being killed by cops since 2015, particularly in black men being killed by cops. There is a drop, I think. I think it's one of those things where whenever something like this happens, that's a catalyst for change. And it's almost like we need. First of all, how ironic is it that Colin Kaepernick takes all that shit for kneeling? And I know. I know.  And this fucking guy kneels on this guy's neck and proves the point. He kills the guy by doing the very thing that Colin Kaepernick was criticized for going down on one knee and doing it to a black guy and killing him.  Yeah, kind of fucking crazy. It's because it's sort of symbolic about like, look, this is what they were talking about.  This is the thing. It's right here in front of your face. Now you see it.  Now you get it. Yep, I know. Yeah. I mean, somebody you just sign him. It's like, OK, we fucked up. Go on back. Oh no, please, please, please come back. Yeah, come play. I mean it's it's tough man. I mean you got to protect your bottom line, you know, it's like when the. There's a corporation involved, it's tough for people to speak out. Well, they they didn't want anybody being the guy who gets attention from protesting.  They're like, this is a bad precedent to set. I don't know anything about football, so I don't know what his skill level was, whether or not he would. I mean, those guys get pushed in and out anyway, like the number of years that a guy can play, the average number of years that a guy can play professionally in the NFL. I think it's like two.  Yeah, two or three years. Yeah, it's crazy because it's so brutal. Yeah.  Just and, you know, fresh, young, hungry guys are coming up out of college every fucking day.  Yeah. Yeah.  But it's like, you know, and sports, it's the same thing with Facebook and Zuckerberg and his like, you know, continued position of like well to get a balance, it's like it all, it just comes off like the reaction to Kaepernick or Facebook's reluctance to do anything or even like Facebook's reluctance to do anything about what?  Well, Zuckerberg, you know, is basically saying, like, we're not we're not here to edit anything. And I'm not saying that I'm for editing, but it's OK.  If you have a if you have if you're in charge of a company, the you're the face of the company.  So what you do is a reflection of what you believe in. Right.  So in his particular case, he must actually believe this, but he just believes that to say nothing, to do nothing about the things that are posted, which which, you know, you can argue in court all day, it does it incite violence or is it just someone being free, expressing their free speech or, you know, whatever the deal is?  But if someone's consistently hitting a certain angle and the response is pretty palpable and fairly measurable, and yet you choose to just allow it to be what it is because, you know, people figure it out, they'll educate themselves, that type of a thing.  You have to take some kind of a position from a humanitarian point of view. And I think that I'm very disappointed in in social media in general because because they're trying to protect their bottom line.  And that's really what it comes off as it doesn't come off as like, well, I want to protect free speech if it to me comes across more like we need to protect our bottom line, because if we if we start editing something, then it's going to be a huge landslide. Everyone's going to be like, oh, we'll screw this, screw these guys for a stifling free speech and all of that stuff when in actuality it's it only the only reason why you would make decisions like that are really just to protect the bottom line.  I don't really understand any other because you I mean, even Apple takes a position, you know, like Tim Cook will issue a letter that's then able to be circulated. And you can read the letter in like, oh, OK, that's interesting. They don't believe in this and they don't believe in this as a company.  Zuckerberg is more like, well, I believe in in whatever the greater bland generalization is for my operating system ecosystem.  Well, first of all, if we want to talk different between Apple and Facebook, these differences are gigantic. Apple is a technology company.  They are not a social media platform. The difference between the responsibility of a technology company and the responsibility of a social media platform is sure enormous. It's enormous. The consequences are enormous.  Apple makes phones and computers and they have an app store and, you know, they take down bad apps and, you know, things that they find that are spying on people and the like. But they don't really have the same dilemmas that someone like Facebook has.  When you talk about the importance of free speech, when as soon as you decide, OK, this person can't talk, but this person can, what you're essentially saying is my viewpoint is better than the viewpoint of the person that I disagree with.  Now, if you have very specific things like you can't dox people, you can't threaten people, you can't say anything racist or sexist or homophobic or once you establish those parameters, you know, if you decide that this is how you're going to operate, if this is your company.  There's a real good argument that you should be allowed to do that because it's your company.  But then when it gets when the company gets big enough where it's like Facebook or Twitter, then you get a real argument for how the best argument for bad speech, the best antidote is more speech. It's better speech. So someone says something that's wrong. There's a real education value in being able to correct that and having other people correct it, like just eliminating it.  Yeah.  In some ways strengthens the resolve of the people that hold that marginalized idea, whether it's racism or sexism or whatever. When you just eliminate it, then they go off and it tends to strengthen their their resolve.  It's sure, you know, I'm sure.  And then particularly when it comes to things like right wing issues or left wing issues, if you're if you're running, there's no right wing social media site that's as popular as the left wing ones. But if there was and they just decided we're not going to tolerate any trans stuff, we're not going to if you start talking about how a man who has a sex change is now a woman, we're going to tell you, go fuck yourself. That's not real.  We're not going to tolerate abortion. You want to talk about abortion rights. You're killing babies. Get the fuck off our platform. Like that's the kind of shit that right wing zealots would do to people that hold left wing ideology.  But conversely, you do see that from people who are left wing zealots, who are angry about people who have right wing ideas and maybe even not so right wing like Megan. I'm sorry if you've heard this before. I use this example all the time. If you're listening, Megan Murphy, who is a what you would call a trans exclusion, exclusionary radical feminist, they call her turf.  And what that means is she's a person that's a feminist that doesn't believe that you can just change your sex and then you can have these arguments and deal with women's issues like a trans person she believes is different than a woman and a feminist. And there was some sort of a debate she was having online where with someone on Twitter and she said, but a man is never a woman. And so they told her she has to take that down. And so she didn't want anyone on Twitter.  OK, so she takes it down and then she makes a screenshot of it and post that.  And so they banned for life. For life for saying a man is never a woman.  Look, it's one thing if you're shitting on someone and you're you're mad at someone, you're saying a man is never a woman. But if you want to just talk biology, a man is never a woman.  So if you're a person who is a left wing progressive zealot and you don't want anybody that's not adhering or complying at all to the to the ideology of progressive people, you ban someone like that.  And so, yeah, you know, I'm saying this is the problem with censorship is like, where do you draw the line?  My opinion in that case is you let that woman say that and you let people correct her and you let people correct the people to correct her. And you you get a lively debate where people get to discuss whether or not they are different things.  And I think there's a real valid intellectual argument in that there's a valid social argument in that.  But this is the problem with censorship.  Well, you know, and my thing is like I'm not exactly I'm not saying I'm not saying to censor. I'm just saying weighing in on the conversation.  So how do you do that, though? Well, you take responsibility for it. It's like it's. But what specifically are we talking about? Well, I'm just saying, like, for instance, if I look at my comments, I say I post something on Twitter and there's all these comments, whatever, like like a lot of my friends who have Twitter accounts, they may they may read the comment and be like, oh, that guy's an asshole or whatever and never say anything.  And there's just like all of these, you know, comments that are sometimes just troll people just trying to get reactions and stuff like that, all that, all that.  I like to personally engage all of that shit and I like to come at them with a conversation. And the thing that ends up happening with something like Facebook is because it's like I'm just a I guess I'm biased because I don't think I don't think very much of Zuckerberg at all.  And he's just kind of a little bit of a thief or a lot a bit of a thief. He's a thief. And he's not he's not an innovator in any way. He's running a company.  But when you say a thief, well, because he stole the ideas, you know, some people that were going to school with him around that time period and he just basically stole the initial code for Facebook, which was generated by a few different people and just kind of made off with it.  He's just like, you know, it's like it's like how all many companies are formed.  It's like someone had an idea. There's no way for them to protect the idea because someone capitalized on the idea of those people can't sue him.  I don't know. I don't know. I think it's because it's arbitrary. I think it's like where that came from, where the original code came from and so forth is arbitrary.  So they must be furious. I know that they're furious, you know, and I know that they're furious.  And I know some other people from startups that as he addressed it. No, of course, he's not going to address it. I mean, he may maybe. Maybe he did. I don't know. I'm not an expert on it. All I know is that in the beginning there was that. And then in parallel, as it was growing and as they were making decisions, I would hear from people that are in his orbit that would kind of describe his decision making process processes and so forth.  And I don't get a sense that he he understands.  His responsibilities, social responsibility, are his responsibility to the identity of the company seems very far removed and his actions kind of dictate that it's like a little bit laissez faire in the sense that if if I have, like, going back to my comments, I'm commenting on those things because I'm letting I'm letting people comment. Mm hmm. But I'm engaging in a conversation with, OK, so are you open to anybody being able to comment back to you?  Oh, you say whatever they want.  Yes, of course. Yeah. But, you know, the what is the explanation that YouTube did for this? But this is the problem with banning comments or deleting comments. It gets that stuff can get co-opted. And there was a situation recently where YouTube was caught deleting comments that were critical of the Chinese Communist Party.  And what they said was that it was a software glitch. Oh, yeah. Now that's them protecting their bottom line 100 percent, right?  Yeah, that's what I would imagine, totally. But I saw that. I said, OK, but that's what I'm talking about, like that kind of shit. Like once someone comes in and says, hey, I would really like it if you remove those things that talk about, you know, some of the mean stuff that we do here.  Yeah. And we're willing to do business with you, but we want you to put filters up.  Yes. So they said it was a software glitch. I don't know how that software glitch is actually works out and targeted of the Chinese Communist Party. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  I mean, that's that's my problem. I mean, I don't have I'm not saying get rid of stuff. I'm just saying be more accountable as the face of a company.  So what would you like him to do differently? Well, I know you don't like them, but OK, so is it just Facebook or do you have this problem with YouTube?  Do you have this problem with Twitter? I mean, here's my problem.  Whenever you whenever power is consolidated and there's there are always going to be problems because there's because there's going to be all these different ways that people wish that it were and it's not working for them in this way and so forth. My thing is the future is distributed.  It's a distributed network, distributed social networks.  I have my own app, WhatsApp, that I created. Oh, what's that? It's just an app. It's yeah. WhatsApp. It's only on iOS we can look. What do you do. It just has it has exclusive content. I created a bunch of like interviews with Jack White and and Leslie Feist and Fred Armisen are on there in this stupid series. I called your conversations a shot entirely on drones and you can't really hear the conversation because the drones are too loud.  Really?  Yeah, it's really stupid. But yeah, check it out. WhatsApp, it's out there, but it's got live streaming.  I have a store that I sell all my old electronics on.  But, you know, I have other artists that are interested in making an app. But apps are notoriously cut the cost prohibitive I mean, over one hundred thousand to create an app.  Right.  So I managed to get my app made for a really, really cheap price. A brilliant guy named Oliver Klein, Oliver Thomas Klein designed a single handedly. The whole app is amazing and his aesthetic is awesome.  But my thing was, if I can create a template and keep getting the price down to make an app and they're just using the template that I created for other artists and other bands, then we can have a distributed network of apps that can communicate with one another without the need of Facebook, Instagram, any of these these social media platforms.  And that way, when a fan comes to visit my site, they know it's my shit.  It's not being tracked. No one's getting tracked.  There's no social for my for my app. There's no there's no social component to it. People can't comment on anything. There's just content to observe, events to behold and electronics and headphones to be bought and that's it.  So when you go there, it feels like a safe space.  And so if there's an interconnected network of distributed apps, which essentially are just kind of interactive websites, I guess that's what an app is.  Ultimately, now you've got something that distributed fans can kind of trust that it's a safe space.  It's not owned by Facebook, it's owned by any of these corporations. So for me, it's about power consolidation. It's never going to be what you want it to be. It'll be convenient and it'll be ever present, like Google for whatever reason. Google, I have a better opinion of than Facebook and mainly, I will say also. The other big factor with Facebook to me is the aesthetics are piece of shit. It's a it's a confusing, terribly design piece of shit.  It also encourages verbose dialogue, encourage. You could write as long as you want. Yeah, but these fucking long rambling. Oh yeah. It people. Yes. Did I know. I know. I haven't even seen a Facebook.  I haven't done Facebook in like nine years and eight years, nine years.  And whenever I even get a glimpse of it my anxiety shoots through to the roof because the design is so terrible, it is such a shitty designed websites filled with ads.  It's terrible.  And also the only good thing about Facebook is. Oh, and they didn't even anything they didn't come up with that, they just bought it how Instagram was cool. It's kind of still holding it down a little bit. They own it, though. They didn't. They didn't create it. Yeah.  Like, done. What have they done to it? They've done anything different. They made it. Yeah.  Yeah, they made ads. Now there's ads everywhere. That's true.  And now there's they're tracking everything. The timeline is not chronological.  It's algorithmic. All that's weird. That's really weird.  So they're basically usually chronological, used to be chronological, which it should always be chronological, but they fucked with it. So isn't that an option, though, where you could view it, Chronologic?  I don't think so, no. I can't find a way to change it. Everyone everyone argues about it.  It's it's just terrible design. But but that's all we got, right?  We got Twitter, we got Instagram, and then we've got some tick tock, which is owned by a Chinese company.  I don't the government won't let you put that on your phone. Oh yeah. Military. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.  Because it's owned by a Chinese company, which I have no problem with Chinese people. But the Chinese government. Oh yeah. I mean super creepy.  Yeah. Well, there's this guy that I follow. We find his thing on YouTube. He's an Internet privacy guy. Yeah. And I've gotten really deep into this lately. Let me find out.  I've got a bunch of subscriptions. You have to figure out what my fucking subscriptions are.  But he's many. I have way too many. I have too many. Is this Internet privacy guy, he sells these things on his website that are d Google phones.  So really? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Where do you find your subscriptions. On your, on your, your app.  Oh fuck is it.  Oh there it is. Your channel, your membership, your data settings. Do do do do subscription.  Where's my fucking subscriptions. Piece of shit. Oh here we go. Subscription subscriptions as a general search. It's under your ID.  Oh OK. Yeah, a second subscriptions. Guys, here's all my subscriptions and my pass codes. So there we go.  Where's his fucking no touch? I put it in there, didn't show me. Where are you finding it? Oh, yeah.  If you if you do, it's under Apple ID.  Oh, under Apple. Yeah. You know, someday like. Is that it's settings. Yeah. So right here at the very top with your like little image. Just click on that.  Okay. And then subscriptions are right, the fourth after payment in shipping. OK. Anyway, this guy has he's a huge proponent of online privacy, and so he sells all of these here it is appointee's subscriptions.  He sells all of this.  Now, that's not what I'm looking for. I'm looking for the YouTube stuff that I subscribe to. Oh, YouTube at the site.  Yeah, YouTube, as the Brazilians would say. YouTube.  What do you find it just at the bottom now? They've changed it. So Leithead Library, OK.  And then there you can hit or if you just hit the subscription button, actually you should be able.  But that's going to be categorical by like most recent uploads when I see a library, I don't see I see my video just hit the subscripts downloads where you bottom the bottom right in the middle.  Let's your iPhone updated. There it is. Keep doing it right, but that's just showing me videos. It's not showing me channels.  Yeah, that's the way to start at the top. Then you can search the channels that you subscribe through. Yeah. So it's a feed. Yeah. See, right here, there should there should be just right at the bottom. Just subscriptions. Yeah I got that.  Oh you got that. Yeah. But it's not showing me the channels it has.  Oh yeah. OK, here we go. There you go. OK, I got it. Boy, this is fucking man.  It's not your fault. It's whenever that shit happens, it's bad design.  Oh, I subscribe to many. This could be a long, boring, boring thing.  Um, just see if you can find an Internet privacy guy, if that's. No, that's one of them. That's a phone. But the Fairphone is I think that's an unfair phone. Yeah. That's one of those Linux phones.  What is your cell phone three review. Yeah.  Yeah. Fairphone is its own channel.  Yeah. But that's not it. Rock draftsmen. That's it. Brackman Tech. It's this gentleman who's very much into privacy and he's so into privacy. I want to look at his fucking history myself.  What are you hiding from? But he's got a website and on his website, he actually sells Digg, Googled Android phones, was very well Googled Android phones.  So he takes these two thousand nineteen.  And, you know, I think that's the most recent you can buy like a Motorola Android phone and they take all the Google out of it.  And so Google's no longer tracking you.  You don't have to log in with Google. Yeah, yeah.  Just websites. What does dot net. Yeah, I stick it to the Zuck. I think that's one of his websites. That's but that's not his main website. So I know that is his website, but that's on his main website. He's got a website though his. He's got it.  Look like if you have a support me Patreon contact me VPN you know there.  That's it. No, he's got a website where he sells stuff.  OK. And Braxton dot something or another, but he sells, he's got like a Droid, he's got a VPN wi fi hub.  So even when people use your Wi-Fi, it all goes through a VPN.  Oh, I love that. Yeah, I love that.  Find his website, though. See, that's that's just Google. That's the future Brackman website. That's totally.  Yeah. The future. It's like the future is distributed to Robert Brackman Tech. It's encrypted. Yeah. That's it. Brak stop me. That's him. Yeah. See so he sells a bunch. Look it shows your IP address at the top. Oh creepy's. Oh.  Letting you know. Oh hey Fux. What's the what's the website again.  Brak stop me Brocke stop me. Yeah he's there's a see if you could. Yeah that's. That's privacy focused social media. So he's got a bunch of different stuff that he sells, but he also has a store and if you go to the store, look at it, because I use a VPN for my.  It's right. We're not going to find out why we're doing this. Yeah, something's wrong. I don't know what what happened wrong.  Something has changed. Something's wrong. Something tells me he's just talking about all the different ways in these videos that he makes on YouTube, all the different ways that you're being tracked through your fingerprints or your face I.D. through every Google search, all your location data. And, you know, there's this recent thing that came up where Google is being sued in Arizona because they turned location services on even when you have it off. Oh, whoa. So even when you turn location services off with Google, it's still searching your location.  It's still reporting that data back to Google.  So there's a lawsuit right now about that. Yeah, that's that's the problem. And I mean, it's like, you know, I have this a little bit of that attitude, but it is an attitude where I'm like, well, I'm going to do everything I can to protect myself. You know, I run VPN on my phone, I've got a Winston VPN with everything, my browser, you know, to help protect the stuff.  I'll do as much as I can without getting overly geeky and then, like, paranoid about everything.  Right. Because ultimately they want to track where I'm at. I'm at like they're just going to track where I'm at and whatever. I don't know what it is. But if I can do things like, oh, create my own app now, I'll take it into my own hands and I can do as much as I wear. If I know hackers and programmers and coders, we can actually just start creating our own version of the Internet. Right.  But if you want to use Instagram or you want to use Facebook, like. Yeah. You getting tracked? Oh, no, for sure. No, you're going to use those things. But you know, but you already know. But if you're working with like programmers and hackers, they know how you're being tracked. So the way that you use your you know, like, for instance, every ad that I get, I always market is junk.  What is this, Jeremy? What you're talking about is a product that's been around since that since 2011 when it was found called graffiti. Yeah. Or they tap into all social media and mix it with Google data and sell it to you. Never would like to buy it to use it for.  Yeah. Well but yeah. It's capitalism gone crazy.  Well I mean I guess there's so much value in knowing once, once Facebook started getting insanely rich just off of data. Yeah. There's so much value in knowing what you're up to, knowing where you going, knowing what you're buying, knowing what you're seeing. Of course. How many times have you been talking about something and then you have ads on your phone every time, guaranteed every time.  So creepy that I'm never going to stop being creeped out by that.  Oh, it's every time, like, I'm you know, I remember talking to my mom, it was just recently in Montana to talk to my mom. And I mentioned a thing maybe two or three times.  And we have a Google whatever home thing, you know, in the house. And and I went downstairs and went to Amazon and Amazon suggested the product during in bed with Google.  Yeah, of course.  And there's like, you know, and so my thing is like I'll use whatever. I'm not going to be so paranoid.  That's going to bum me out and ruin my life. But I am going to work with people that are really smart and engineers and so forth. And I'm just going to create my own version of the things that I use all the time with my platform.  Essentially, you could do the same thing if you create your own app, right. And not go the crystalize route, which which, you know, God bless him.  All the subscription, all the junky stuff, it's like, what is he doing on his app? It's like it's a subscription based app.  And I was thinking about like doing something like, oh, charging me for that.  He uses that anymore. And I don't think he has done that. And I text him, I go, hey, what the fuck is this like a couple of years ago? What does he say? Do that anymore? Oh yeah.  Floating around out there. It is floating out, but it's still making money, is it. Oh yeah.  Because you can still subscribe, but he doesn't have anything anymore. I mean I just it was like maybe I don't know. Half a year ago I checked it, it was still active and then I deleted it.  But I just I just think, like, when you subscribe, my thing is the future is distributed.  Also, I believe in a direct economy and the direct economy is like, oh, you've got something, I'm going to buy it from you. And that's excluding like if you're using an Internet, like safety, you know, payment system, whatever, like PayPal or whatever, that they're going to take a small percentage of it.  I don't really care necessarily about that. I definitely understand the engineering behind it. But just like if there's something that you want to sell, then sell it directly.  Subscription is a weird thing. I mean, subscription to me is cool.  If Instagram and Facebook went to a subscription model so that I didn't have to see any of the fucking ads and that I was guaranteed that my tracking was being limited, like YouTube as YouTube red. So. Right. So I have to premium, right. Yeah.  I never see an ad. I can't stand ads if I see it. I was well yeah. I'm going to, I'm going to murder somebody. I agree with you. That would be a really smart move for them because I think they'd probably generate additional revenue. That way and goodwill, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, very good point. Yeah. Instagram to pay attention. Fuck yeah. Fuck, fuck, fuck fuck faces.  Yeah. It's very rarely, very rarely do they suggest something to me that I'm interested in now or they suggest stuff that you already have sometimes so many times are like, oh there's that thing I already.  But every now and then though every now and then there's one of them, a little sponsor. I know. I know. Kind of good product.  Well, you know, what I'll do is I go to Brave a private browser, you know, so I'll go to Brave. Yeah. Was brave and brave and then I'll look up the product there I used to go to. Oh I used to go to the stock to go to the search engine. Sucks on it.  It's not as good but you know, whatever. But then I look at in your underwear that's absolutely 100 percent checking under your fingernails.  It's tough man. It's tough being a modern human.  It is, but it's almost inevitable. I mean, I feel like we have to accept this new reality. Yes.  You know, privacy is one day going to be a thing of the past and not just in terms of like what you browsing, but I think what you think you know, one thing that Elon said to me in the last conversation I had to really creep me out is like, you're going to be able to talk without words because just talking about neural link, you have the neural link.  You talk without being able to talk and have conversations without words, without.  Oh, God damn it, what are you going to do that leads to Hive mind? We're going to have hive mind.  Well, here here's here's the thing. My condensation or the or the condensing of technology in general. It's we are fascinated with creating the things that we already do that we already do inherently.  Right. So that idea of like being able to talk without words, it's like that happens all the time anyway. So you ever go on a dance floor and watch people like dancing and like someone's like communicating and they're just body language, they know what's going on or you're about to call your friend and suddenly your friend calls.  That's why we are communicating without words like on the dance floor is a perfect example of like one of them, Portia's, where the accent goes out and, you know, you're out of control, that there's some communication there to you, like just doesn't have to control his body.  Yes, exactly. Yeah. It's like, oh, I'm going to stay away from that person.  Just stay away. Stay away. This person is losing control. I can dance over here. He can't he can't dance. And then, you know, but then but then then there's a you know, there might be like a compassionate choreographer like here I'll teach you how to dance.  I would think I would make an example of you. You know, those women aren't real. I know you don't think that there's, like, benevolent choreographers that'll help you to your liver. Those those girls, they drug you and steal your liver. You wake up in a tub filled with ice. I love that.  That's a stir that like if that actually was a stereotype for choreographer's, I don't trust choreographer's. You know, one minute they're teaching you a bunch of routines and then the next you're in a bathtub with no lifrieri.  Yeah. You're making out with some Eastern Bloc check and I'll fall asleep and you wake up and there's a deep pain and the right side of your body, like, what the fuck?  Oh, no big chunk of your liver's missing. No, that's not the future I live in.  I, I'm shooting for the I'm shooting for the high ground man. We're going to do it. Yeah. I can't do it. I don't know. I have great faith for the human race. I do too. I mean I think this is a terrible blip in our civilization.  And yeah, I think we've had terrible blips in the past and we've gotten over them. The problem right now is we're our foundation is really being tested because we've had multiple blips in a row.  Yes. Big heavy ones. Yep. And, you know, big stress test, big ones. Big ones. And unless we have a period of peace where we can digest these and recover, yeah. We're deteriorating, which is like taking these hits like an old boxer getting knocked out like. Whoa. Yep.  Like yep. And brain damage and tissue damage. Yeah. I mean, I mean that's the thing. It's like you remember, you know, like what I'm hoping for is a, you know, another age of enlightenment, you know, like Spain had one, you know, there have been every every most large cultural epicenters have had these moments where things kind of came in the balance after some great turmoil. And we were able to just put on cruise control for a little while.  Yeah. And like explore more in depth and nuance things about who we are.  But those things existed before social media, I think. True. The only way we're going to be able to pull that off today is with mushroom's time.  We're going to need some. Yes, yes.  Let's see. We'll know. Like, oh, this reality that you're in is a very bland, two dimensional projection of the reality that you can experience.  Yes. It's our little fungus friends. Yes.  Just a little bit of an escape from this tired realm into a land of infinite possibility of love and understanding and connectedness and and the dissolving of the ego in the likes of which you've never experienced before. And if we can all do that, if that could be legal, marijuana has radically changed the culture of California. Radically change the culture of Denver, radically change the culture of everywhere where it's been legalized, it's true and it's changed the way people communicate with each other.  It's changed their ideas about law enforcement because we're no longer worried about jackbooted thugs knocking down our door because we like to smoke a plant that makes us happy. It's not a concern anymore.  Yeah, that's a fundamental shift in just how we are as a human race. And that's a it's a mild psychedelic in psychedelics. They come in very you know, if marijuana is a gateway to anything, it's a gateway to the real psychedelics.  It's the gateway mushrooms. Oh, give me the DMT. Yeah, it's a gateway to mescaline and ayahuasca. Yeah. All those really fucking sound world dissolving ones. It's a gateway to those things. And I really think that we need something like that at this time.  We need we need rituals, some sort of psychedelic rituals and and best processed by real legitimate professionals. Yes. In real life, establish centers where people actually know what they're doing. We could help people get past this this bump in our evolutionary travels.  Yeah. And all the trauma you've got to deal with the trauma. We can't we can't. You know, we we try to run away from most of the time and we try to feel good about stuff.  And and you just need to take it on, understand it and then transform it. Yeah. Transform it in to a part of yourself that makes you stronger. And psychedelics, really, they're just like a reminder. It's a reminder of how we are, you know, because when children are born and their eyes are glinting everywhere and they're trying to absorb as much as they can about the world, they don't care about color. They don't care about any of the shit that we have problems with this.  All that stuff's learned, that initial state is essentially what happens with psychedelics.  We go back to the interconnectedness of consciousness and however you want to define that. But the experience of it is very interconnected. And it's a reminder that, oh, yeah, we're part we're natural organisms. We're part of this planet. This planet is a part of a solar system, the solar system. Yeah.  And you also realize that your life experiences and your memories and even your personality is basically like a tiny pop up tent that you've set up in the wilderness of real consciousness.  Yeah.  Got a little stove here. Yeah, I'm going to cook my tea and I got it all under control. Yeah. And then he unzipped that tent and you go out into the fucking wilderness of of psychedelic consciousness. Oh my God. I've been living in a tent, I've been living in this little baby pup tent. This has been my reality. Yes. And it's true. More insecure people are the more they want to define what is allowed and not allowed inside that tent.  Exactly. One hundred percent.  That's like, you know, I mean, and guaranteed. I've had arguments with people.  I mean, I remember there was like a skinhead on a bus once and we had a conversation together and he was still an active skinhead.  We were sitting across from each other. Oh, I was. But we kind of like he commented on something I was wearing or something like that. And we started talking for a second. We were talking about mutual things. And then he got he got up to get off the bus and he just looked at me and just kind of and he just kind of shrugged and, like, walked off.  And I was like, that's interesting. Basically, a neo-Nazi guy was on a bus. And for whatever reason, we connected on this one thing. And it reminded me of, you know, the cartoon with the sheepdog and the and the.  Yeah, morning, Ralph. Yeah. For us, it's like that's how sometimes I like to view stuff. I'm like, OK, so you're going to play the role of the person who is the fascist. I'm going to play the role of the person who is, you know, afraid and hiding in the shadows, OK, and go and seen and action.  And there's something about like, you know, I talk to my friends about it.  It's like there there is a way if you're if you're smart, you're intuitive and you're emotionally intelligent enough, you can always find your way to that person's core and you can share a value.  If you can share one value, you can make it. You can learn something, even if it's a brief moment, just for a second. And the Internet connected moment with another person who shares none of your values at all.  Do you know Dell Davis is no doubt Dell Davis is a guy. He's a brilliant guy. I've had him on my podcast before. He is a blues musician who has personally converted more than 200 KKK and Nazi members and got them to leave. And he did this. He got them to leave these hate groups. And he did this because he met a guy at a gig. He was doing a gig and he met this guy. And the guy was like, you play, you know, you're really good musician.  And they get to talking. And he sits down with the guy and the guy says to him, I was talking to well, I never had a drink with a black guy before he started the thought. The guy was joking. He's like, come on, man.  And he's like, no, I really haven't. And he goes, You haven't? And he goes, No, I'm in the KKK.  And he's like, What? The guy pulls out, it's fucking KKK. I'd yeah. So Darrell gives this guy is no. And says, hey, I'm going to be in town again, you know, when I'm when I'm in town again, let's let's have a drink, let's talk. So they become friends. So they start talking a few months after they become friends. The guy hands him his grand wizard outfit and says, I'm quitting. He says, obviously, I was wrong.  I had this idea that black people were in fear. First of all, Darryl is extremely intelligent, very articulate and a brilliant musician.  And just the way he talks, it's very clear that he's smarter than you like. He's smart guy. So if you're a dumb dude, he's in the KKK and you're talking to this guy who you've in your group, you've determined this is an inferior guy, but he's obviously smarter than you. So what the fuck? And he's a really nice guy. He's a nice guy. So they become friends. They start eating dinner together. He has them over for meals and just quits, says, I'm not doing this anymore.  I'm not I'm not going to be a racist anymore. Hands him is out of it. So Darryl brought all these outfits with him. He showed me this Nazi flag this guy gave him. And he's got all these different grand dragon and grand wizard, not just now, but him personally.  His one on one interactions has converted more than 200 people into the podcast.  Please, if you have the time, please find it. Daryl Davis, Daryl Davis podcast with me and him three hours long of him just telling these stories about meeting these Nazis and meeting these KKK guys and converting them.  That's that's not something he set out to do. This is what's really crazy as a grown man, just a musicians just happened, not set out to do.  Yeah, well, you know, it goes down in my my my new catchphrase is love as efficient, you know, as work.  Yeah. It just works because like, once you're just like you're not noticing the stuff, you just casually talking, you're shooting the shit with somebody and you're like, oh yeah, it's cool. Oh, I love, you know. And then before you know it, they're just like, oh what, what, what.  It just everything crosses. You're like but they shouldn't be. But I but but I was scared of but I thought yeah. You know, it's like the first time you meet like, like the first time I saw like, like a queen, you know, like a drag off, you know.  And that was there's so tall and so, so boisterous, so big. And I was like I'll never be able to, you know, be able to energetically mingle with someone like that and come to understanding. And then I've had some of the most incredible conversations with so many people of all different kinds of walks of life that I thought I didn't hate them or anything.  I just thought there was something in common.  Yeah, they're so different, like why would we have in common?  And I just realized that I just love pretty much everybody, you know, like can find common ground, like almost anyone I can find common ground with as long as they're open and they're willing to find common ground with you.  Yes, of course. Yeah. And and it's awesome. And a lot of it is just like being confident enough in yourself. Yeah.  That you're like whatever they're doing, whatever they're projecting at me, I understand it's them projecting at me or brave enough to explore with them.  Yes. Brave enough to talk with them about those things. Yeah. Well that's what people need.  Find that fucking common ground in this day and age. And that's one of the things with gigantic numbers of human beings. These the population that we're experiencing. Yeah. I mean, hundreds of millions of people in this country.  It's hard for us to just realize the value in each individual, each each unique individual, you know, on a percent.  One hundred percent. I mean, it's funny, when I had my car dropped off Montana, like I didn't really you know, everyone kind of keeps themselves in Montana. That's kind of a conservative, you know, place, especially Great Falls. But car came out of the car trailer and my across the street neighbors came out, the other neighbors when I was a kid. I don't know if it's the same family. I think it's the same family.  But they were like they would call me racist shit all the time. And my mom would like get up in their face and me like, I'm going to kill you if you touch my kid and stuff like that.  They're still there. Oh, they're still there. Yeah. I mean, they they've changed. I think they've moved on, but they've changed. And, you know, and I had some early when we first moved there, problems with my dad, like sitting on the porch smoking the cigarettes and people going like was that guy doing out there, you know, whatever.  And then my mom's white and they're confused.  But but all of these neighbors came out and people came down from the street, you know, and they're just like, oh, what's going on? They're like looking at the car and they're like, Oh, hey, can I grab a picture and stuff like that. And and the thing that I noticed, it's like that was the first time all my neighbors were like together on the street and for this moment and then that kind of realized.  But when you have a platform where people recognize what you do and oh, by the way, congratulations on Spotify. That's fucking rad. When I saw that, I was like, good for them to celebrate that.  That's great.  But like, when you have a platform and you could be any way you wanted to be to anybody coming up to you if they recognize you from your platform.  But if you if you are open and inclusive and taking the time to spend with people, it does so much for a community like. Most people who solves those boundaries completely and they're like, well, I was expecting you to be kind of blah blah, or I was expecting you to be there and you're like, I'm not any of those things.  Let's all just have a good time and let's support local businesses or whatever, you know, whatever your mantra is. But it in Great Falls, it's great.  I can go places and most of the time people are just total sweethearts.  And they generally say, thanks a lot for not forgetting about where you came from. That's dope.  That's huge.
