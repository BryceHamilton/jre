Thing to worry about were also brought to you by juv juvies, the thing that I've been using over the last couple of months, and I fucking like it a lot, is a light machine I'll get into this knows that I'm always on the hunt for cutting edge modalities to enhance my performance and improve my overall health and fitness.  And I've long focused on different ways to upgrade my eating, my exercise, my sleep to keep my body balanced and working efficiently. But it wasn't until recently that I learned that sunlight is just as important as diet, exercise, sleep and hydration.  And most of us don't get enough sunlight. Most of us don't realize that we spend over 90 percent of our lives indoors, which is a lot. The downside is you get less sunlight than you need and we're overexposed to blue light from our phones, computers and TV screens. This is an imbalance of light that can lead to negative effects such as inflammation, sluggishness, disrupted circadian rhythms and poor sleep. Well, UV light from the sun helps us create vitamin D, but other colors and wavelengths of sunlight are crucial for our health as well, like red light and near infrared light.  When peer reviewed research showed that red and near infrared light are crucial wavelengths for human health, they stimulate the mitochondria in your cells and help you produce more energy.  Read in near infrared light like juv devices that I use have also shown to have great results to support healthy skin, sleep, fitness and recovery. Juv is the leading red light therapy brand.  That's J o. The V Juv has isolated these red and near infrared wavelengths of light and it delivers them directly to your skin cells in the comfort of your home with none of the potential downsides of sunlight like skin damage and juv just launched their next generation of devices. The new products are sleeker, lighter, with the same power, and they include new features like recovery plus mode for post workout recovery boost. I fucking love it.

All right, my friends, my guest today is a good friend of mine.  He has so many things.  He's one of those guys that when I talk to, I feel lazy because he just does so much shit. He is the lead singer of Tooele. He's the lead singer of Puscifer.  And Puscifer has a new album that's coming out and then don't just have a new album. He doesn't just do that. He has a winery. He owns restaurants, Jesus Christ.  And he has a new event that is streaming on October 30th. And we get into it. I don't want to get into it, too, in too much detail because we get into it deeply in the podcast. And it sounds fucking amazing. He's just one of the coolest people I know. Please welcome Maynard James Keenan. To show German podcast The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast by night all day. This is how you wearing your mask now?  Because I.  I just forget to bring it with me. So if I just like hanging on my nose, I just bring it.  This is a new move. Yeah. People will do that now.  They will see you and say one side of the Wall Street Journal Miniature Schnauzer right here. Oh, you have a cute little dog. Dude, that picture your dog is adorable. Yeah, she's awesome. She's a what's her name.  Taking a walk. Meow. Meow. Yeah, she's 15.  What is Mehos down for beauty crest of a wave. It's Japanese. Oh, Deadlee. Little Mehar from Sin City. Which one was that she had the the swords and oh, right, I know from the movie Sin City, Sin City was a movie, but it was also the comic book comic book machine, the comic books. Well, I don't know if that movie was fucking good, man.  Yeah, I forgot all about that movie until just now.  She's named after a deadly little Mehar.  So we were talking about how well, we didn't talk about how the new Puscifer album comes out on the 30th. I listen to what is available and it sounds awesome.  Does a lot of layers to that shit, man. There's all kinds of sounds coming at you from all over the place. Yeah.  Matha normally what happens with the with our recording process is that I'll have an idea or Matt will have an idea which is kind of set down a direction, for example like I'll go mandolin, drum machine banjo. Let's just start there and start to see what we can build on this thing. And then you have an album like Conditions of My Parole on this. He picked up an old Fairlight and making a Fairlight actually work nowadays.  I don't know what the Fairlight is. It's a it's a it's a synthesizer. And you've heard it on you know, Peter Gabriel used it art noise like I think. Yes. Might have used versions like a Synclavier or a Fairlight. I'm going to get that wrong. And that's going to just he's got his face in his palm right now.  But, you know, so there's very specific sounds of commodities and it's there's a learning curve to go with it. But the cool thing is that it kind of kind of paints you into a sonic corner and then you're sort of layering on that. And then, of course, unconsciously or consciously, you start thinking of all the stuff you heard in in the 80s. You know, that that was used on. Yeah. So you start reacting in that way for those sounds and then, you know, Korina coming in on top of me, adding her piece and then just that kind of, you know, the kind of three way chest that we have going on as a non musician.  It's always interesting to see, like, the way people react to synthesizers, there's synthesizers. Got to be one of the most polarizing sounds and all. But obviously, it's responsible for some amazing songs. Absolutely. Undeniably, yeah.  But for whatever reason, people either love or hate that kind of sound or.  Yeah. Whenever you know, when you have people that are like, I don't know man. I like live music, you know, totally live music. So you're big, you know, and then you kind of wait, come back around, go. I would think of Kraftwerk. Oh, I love Kraftwerk.  They they put robots on stage and push a button and you pay money to watch and look for mannequins.  It's basically the song. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  But I love Kraftwerk and, you know, so but it's funny when people don't quite make the connection of I don't know what it is they're saying, well, it becomes almost an ideological thing.  It's like you're opposed to it because it's a non cool thing or something.  Yeah. Yeah. Do you remember when Jump came out and everybody was like, what the fuck has happened to Van Halen if they lost their mind? What is this?  De de de de de de de. Meanwhile, one of the biggest fucking songs they've ever put out.  Yeah. A massive super blockbuster.  Yeah. But some people were just like, this is the end.  I remember living in Boston, we had the classic rock station play after WDTN.  I think it was I might have NBC and what's the other one? AAF, PCN.  I think it was PCN, but it was like it was a classic rock channel. And this is 87. Yeah, 88.  I was there and and I remember people losing their shit because they tried to play Van Halen on that station. I like.  That's not classic rock bro. They they really were very adamant about like no, no, no, no, no. Van Halen. This is hairband. That's like some kind of glam rock thing.  There were, you know, Bostonians just getting their, you know, panties in a bunch of their Van Halen on VCM.  Yeah, there was a real resistance to hair metal. There's hairband music came around and Guns N Roses like people put in the hairband category.  And I'm like, boy, you're splitting hairs. Yeah, absolutely.  It's hardly hair band muse. I mean, it's. Yeah, sweet child of mine and like, you know, welcome to the Jungle. I mean, these these are fucking great songs. It's hard.  Like hairband to me is like I get why people would like it. I understand it, but it's simple. It's like it's a piece of candy. Yes.  You know, whereas like, you know, Guns and Roses had they put out some fine meals, you know, some of their some of their songs were, you know, there were it was one meal, but it was a good meal.  But they were like well crafted pieces. Whereas, you know, there's I don't wanna name some bands, but there's some, you know, some bands that were eyelash extensions and fucking crazy hair and Bowie. Bowie, he didn't do it right? Right, good point. Yeah, but nobody's given him shit. You can't give him shit.  He's well, how undeniable is Michael Jackson that even though people think he most likely did some horrible shit, they still plays music?  Yeah. And oddly enough, the the Fairlight is part of some of those records. Sure.  Boom, boom, boom, boom. That's all those that's all those synthesizers we're talking about.  When did synthesizers come around? Like what was the first introduction? Like when when they got modern music. Uh. I'm having a brain fart. It'll it'll come. It's that's if there's a specific, but there was there was sound manipulation that Ban started introducing prior to that. Right.  Like Hendrix started doing weird shit with pedals and yeah, you got a Mellotron, which is kind of recorded on tape and it's looped and you're playing, you know, the recorded sounds on these on these looping cassettes. But that was still kind of analog. And I'm having there's a specific keyboard and I'm bad at that. Must be the norm. 56, bro. Dude, I'm 53. I get it.  My my brain is my my memory is so inconsistent. Like, sometimes it's amazing and sometimes it's just straight dog shit.  Like people I've known for ten years. I can't remember the fucking name. It doesn't make any sense. Things that I know what that thing is and I can't fucking.  All right. By the way, is good to see George over here. George. George.  His name is Brian. We should probably explain what's happened. This almost didn't happen. Young Jamie got the covid.  Young Jamie's got a new lady friend and the new lady friend wanted to go to a bar.  And young Jamie was like, OK, so he went to a bar and bars in Texas.  They do not give a fuck out here. They they go outside and they're on a patio and they just drink like there's no covid and they're bumper to bumper with people all partying down.  And a few days later, Jamie thought he had a sinus infection. He was just all stuffed up and felt like shit only for a day. And then the next day started to feel better. Day after that is like, I can't be covid. He's like, I know I have allergies. He has allergies. It's ragweed season apparently comes in, gets tested. And the only one we were concerned with is our employee, Jeff, our friend Jeff and Jeff was actually fairly close to Jamie for a few minutes talking to him.  I never got any closer than twenty feet from them. And most of the time I was about thirty to forty feet from as soon as I found, because Jamie came in first and got tested first. And as soon as I found I didn't feel well, I stayed the fuck away from him. I thought because I was in the room with him, maybe I would have to quarantine.  But the doctor said, How close were you? And I was like, no closer than 20 feet. So you don't have to worry about it. Just get tested every day. And so I'm three negative tests in a row, so. Ninety nine percent point nine. Ninety nine percent sure I'm good. But yeah, Jeff, I'm a little worried about. So Jeff's not here today. Poor bastard.  But we almost didn't do it because I thought the protocol was I was going to have to stay. But they, I no they consider close contact six feet or closer for more than fifteen minutes. Not really close. Oh that kind of close. Yeah. Yeah.  I wonder if you can do you get it from fucking Brian you know. Yeah absolutely. It's liquids. That's how I got mine. Did you. Wow. Amazing. But you fuck so much. How would you know that's how you got. I fucked myself.  Oh because you're not sure though. So anyway we pulled it off and we did do it. So here we are. The other thing that's coming out tomorrow is a tape where apparently Rudy Giuliani tries to fuck a fifteen year old.  Allegedly, allegedly, allegedly, allegedly. What's funny is like apparently his take on it. And again, he's older than us.  So his memory is probably terrible because it happened quite a while ago. They filmed this. His take on was he was proud that they didn't get him the way they've got other people.  And the article that I was reading last night is it's the death of journalism is so goddamn apparent when you read articles and then you see the actual thing and you go, what the fuck did you just write? Because this is not what it is, right? This is like these take some things that are so it's it's there's so much hyperbole and there's so much exaggeration and bias.  Until we watch it, we won't be able to. Yeah.  So, you know, maybe tomorrow. But you know, you have me a Borat. I had Borat. Yeah. I mean, listen, I still think Ali G in the House is one of the most underrated comedy films of all time.  It is good, especially if you like weed. I wouldn't recommend it this month.  Sober October. But when sober October is over in the house, I actually bought a UK version of a VA player because it was only available on VHS from the UK.  OK, was a VHS.  I have you talking about the DVD.  You talking about the actual allergy series.  No, it was a movie. OK. Oh yeah that one still but a movie.  But even even the series was unavailable over here a long time. Long like do the conversion.  But he had a movie right Brian. It was a DVD and it was in all regions. I did buy in all regions player and because of like players were limited to certain region. It was really weird.  I don't have to deal with the science. Behind those is different frequencies. I think it was Powell versus NTSA, NTSC or. And some of them were universal, they would play everything. Yeah, some of the cheaper ones that you could buy, they fries had like a secret like menu, you could switch it back and forth.  Yeah, that was the key. It was like a cheaper one. Yeah. Yeah. So I had to buy once. I literally bought a DVD player specifically for this film. Me and Eddie Bravo got barbecued and we watched this and could not stop laughing. It's a fucking hilarious movie.  It's really ridiculous. So apparently that that comes out tomorrow and Rudy Giuliani is allegedly trying to fuck a 15 year old. But it wasn't really a 15 year old. She was in her 20s playing 15 year old Rudy Giuliani speaks out about on Borat, two controversial calls. It hit job over Hunter Biden campaign. How could it be a hit job over 100 Biden campaign if they shot it in July?  Bro, there's there's no logic to it. It's just they're just trying to cover their ass. I think they have to say that.  I want to know what the girl looked like because they said she was playing. A girl was 15, but I believe she's like twenty five or something like that. How old is the gal? Here's the key, let's see what is here, those pants. Oh, Jesus Christ, looking for Hunter Biden's laptop in there somewhere?  I guess you're saying he was tucking in his shirt, but why would he do that by the bed?  Imagine if that was him in your room lying on the bed. Hey, man, what are you doing?  Unless you have to be a good friend where they were so comfortable, they could lie in the bed and adjust their balls, you know?  But if you just met a person and you're lying in the bed with the hand on the Johnson with, you have sunglasses on, too. Looks like he's on Coke.  That's what I think he's got to be. He's probably smoking it, smoking coke. He's on Viagra. And this girl is touching him, too.  She's checking off his microphone, apparently, because, well, maybe he didn't have the wire because they do talk them down your pants. That is true. Yeah.  I would like to see the film, the footage of it we're going to tomorrow, because if that's the only thing that does make sense in his defense, because sometimes they put those things down your pants and you do got to get in there to get the wire out if he's taking the microphone off.  Yeah, I don't know. Also, here's here's why I'm back here, like, drop it down my jacket and put it on the back here and I don't know why he's putting it in his pants. True. That's true, too. Yeah. Why would you have it in the front?  He might have had it in the front pocket so he could sit down. They often do that. They'll put the mike in your front pocket as opposed to in your back the backyard, because if you sit down on a chair, that thing digs in your back. I've had it in my front pocket before.  But the thing is, like the gal, see, they're being pretty good about not showing.  They're not showing her.  Yeah, I want to know, like, did he know that she was supposed to be 15 or did he just think she was a girl? Here's the thing. If if she is in her 20s and this is all speculation, right. If she is in her 20s and she's beautiful, the problem is he's gross and he's old and a beautiful girl.  If she was and would have to see the footage.  But if she was being flirtatious, like he's he's helpless.  He's under a spell like an old fucked up look, a dude like that, if he thinks like, oh, my God, this might like that might be the last time I'm going to have a heart attack tonight. Yeah.  That a gal who's an attractive young gal decides to put a do it in his lawyer, a dude in his position has to know that that's coming like that. You've got a setup.  It's coming. A setup is coming. Maybe not anymore. Maybe he forgot like he's already do. Yeah. You know, yeah.  I mean, you got to think not only that, but he's been under this tremendous stress of being a top lawyer for the most fucked up administration in the history of the United States. So it's like the just the legal shit he's been battling back and forth.  Yeah. So shit you it's a shit show.  His brains probably hosed and he's probably in this hotel room going, oh, this is throwing me a bone. Oh, yes. Yes, it is. Oh yes. A big old bone.  Just not for you to chew on. It's never stop. It just never stops. There's like every time you think, well, the world's going to be normal today.  I mean, we've gotten it all out of the way now. No new thing.  Arizona is now spiking in in supposedly cases of covid, are they?  Yeah, they were spiking for a while, but it was it was young folks and it wasn't an issue. It was like young folks were getting it.  But the deaths were very low. You had a bad case, right?  I didn't have a back. Yes or no, a medium bad. So it was one of those you know, I'm in Australia. We went out to dinner, my buddy Todd Fox and Chris. And immediately food didn't taste right. But this is now this is all hindsight, right? I didn't know at the time. We didn't know that these are the right things.  You're looking for like a immediately what year or in the month of February and February, you know, so this is certainly so nobody, you know, nobody knew what to tell you.  I immediately was sick then I had to get out on international flight the next morning, fly to New Zealand. Oh, you're a super spreader. Yeah, I'm a super spreader.  You brought it to New Zealand. I brought it abroad. It was it was in me and I put it in you. So we got there. I was like four days in the hotel, could have four days off before the shows. So I was just drinking water, hot showers, taking care of myself, hot tea, just trying to get through it. And it sucked but it wasn't. But you didn't know yet.  Like what how bad this thing could have been. If I hadn't known how bad it could have been, I would have been freaking out. Right.  You'd probably. Yeah, that's interesting. Right. Isolated pretty well.  Like I mean, I was I, I grabbed a mask before I even got on the plane because I just instinctually like just having, you know, friends that are that are, you know, going to Taiwan and going to Japan. Like, you just see the mask like, OK, I'm probably going to wear the mask.  And so this was pre awareness of covid.  Well, no, that was it was happening. But you didn't connect the dots. You didn't think you had.  I asked the doctor when I got to New Zealand, do you think this is cool? And he's like, did you have a fever? I don't remember if I had a fever. Well, then you didn't have coat. You don't have covid.  OK, the the cocky sometimes. Yeah.  So I got through that we did this, I was able to do the show. I didn't close my throat down enough to I would have to cancel then the next shows were going to be in the Northwest. How was it to sing. It was not, it was not fun. It was not fun. We had to kind of just to sit around a little bit, don't put the hard ones in. And I got the Hawaii to go train with Louis' and some of the guys there.  Chad was a moiety instructor and I'm starting to do the Motown. I'm like, dude, this hurts. Like, I've never my hands have never hurt this bad. I thought maybe I sprained him because right after I recovered in New Zealand, I went trained in New Zealand thinking, I'm just going to cut it out. You know, I've got to walk it off, rub some dirt on it. Yeah, I like it. And I felt OK then, but when I got the money.  Finally got to Maui, I'm like, this is not right, this hurts, I can't fucking do this. I thought, well, maybe I sprained my wrist. So months go by that they're not healing. I'm going through harvest at this point and like, nothing's like they're not healing up. It's been harvest your winery. Yeah. So getting into the grapes.  But I finally went to a doctor. Arthritis. Arthritis doctor. And he was like, OK, so walk me through. When you first saw the Ed and I started walking him through everything he goes, you had covid. And with what some of the side effects that you find are the are that it, you know, inflammation. So whatever, I guess, or some kind of a rheumatoid response. That alone would be, well, maybe I'm just 56 and I have arthritis, but my blood work was completely clean everywhere else.  No other issues anywhere else in my body, but just the wrists explaining that. But I still have the cough. So whatever cough I had, whatever cough I got in New Zealand, like every other day I'll have a coughing fit for, you know, for 10 minutes coughing up stuff. So I have lung damage from from. It's still still.  Yeah. Still every other day now. Yeah. Now when you train is your cardio diminished.  Yeah. How much is enough to work.  And it's just my you know, my motivation is diminished because I'm like trying to do stuff and my hands are still not anymore now now that I'm on medication.  What medication. But yeah. Metho. Methotrexate.  You're on meth and I'm smoking meth to get through it. You look great.  Thank you. I lost a lot of weight.  Had I get sketchy, it's much easier to push that like second helping away now, right?  No appetite, but no methotrexate, which is not is not fun to be on. But my wrists have cleared up. I can now I'm back to, you know, doing stuff.  What is methotrexate? Normally it's like a it's for rheumatoid arthritis, but it's basically a chemotherapy.  Oh yeah. Have you tried CBD mean CBD now. Have you tried CBD without the metho tricks or stuff. No, no.  Because that a lot of the methotrexate goes for about it's like a you know, I did I've done it for now. Ten weeks, I have another five weeks supposedly Amadu. But I'm going to continue the CBD after that.  What, how much CBD you're taking a day drop a dropper. Just one. Yeah, I'm taking I take a thousand milligrams a day. It's a high dose, but I'm fine. How big is that?  It's a lot of droppers.  OK, it depends on I use CBD and I forget. I think it's the thirteen hundred milligram dropper. I forget how many droppers I have to do it to hit a thousand a day. But that seems to be the magic number where I have it's kind of like turf toe but it's from kicking. I have some, some pretty intense pain sometimes and my big toe particularly after a hard, heavy bag workout like yesterday, I had a pretty bad OK, but man, I'll take the CBD and now today, like I'm bending my toe right now on the ground, there's no pain at all, OK?  And it's it's amazing.  I fucking love it. I love it for so many. I love it for anxiety. I love it just for, for relaxation. But I really love it for joint pain.  I think CBD is just I can't sing his praises enough. I've had so many friends that have had like real joint problems, like real pain. And then the CBD just completely takes it away of our friend's dog.  The dog was having a really hard time walking like walk with a limp. He gives a dog CBD in like two hours later, the dogs light up and moving around and he's like, this is crazy.  You're listening to Cheech and Chong records getting high, just chillin. Dave Foley had pretty bad arthritis in his hands to the point where he couldn't straighten his fingers out on CBD and now his hands are just mobile again. All right.  Yeah, stuff's legit. It's just that. And adjusting the diet or the two main things, that's what I noticed.  This flares up when I like. I have more than a glass of wine and some gluten in the in the dinner.  Yeah. Then it flares up. So there's it's connected that got damn gluten.  There's something about it. Have you. But you your restaurant, you use heirloom pasta though don't you.  We were I mean it's fifty fifty, it's, it's commercial flour with because we're finding that it's not holding up like you expect pasta to hold up so well anyway.  And the texture. Yeah. Just texture doesn't hold. So we're doing a blend of the heirloom along with commercial. That's interesting.  It doesn't hold up but in Italy they use the heirloom wheat, right. No, not necessarily, no.  They're getting a lot of Arizona. There's a lot of Arizona wheat in the stuff you get from Italy.  Roux because the commodity, the hard winter wheat that we grow is a great blender in. And because they bring all the wheat, they get it together and they send it to Italy, they blend it, they pick their their mix and they blend it. So they actually sell our wheat back to us in the form of great Italian flour. But it's actually grown in the United States.  That's interesting. When I go over there, even though it passed almost every day when I used to be able to go over there, I didn't get bloated. But if I eat pasta here, I just get sick.  Well, there's so many other little things that are going on around it. It's so you're probably over there, you know, for most for the average traveler, you're in a foreign country. It's magical. You're you're walking around or you're you know, there's like. The stairs, you're eating dinner probably earlier in the day or whatever, but you're still walking around your activity, your activities are increased and the wines you're having are probably nicer quality wines. So all that stuff ends up being a better experience for you.  So your body's not reacting way over here.  You're like, hmm, maybe I won't go for the walk. Maybe I'll drink more than I should.  I like what you're saying, but no, not me.  All right. Over here, I work out like a fucking terrorist. And over there I barely work out at all. I'm getting hammered every day.  I'm eating until I literally can't stick another ravioli in my face.  No, that's not what's going on. I don't know what's going on. I'm definitely walking around quite a bit, you know, but I work and I'm just always doing something here.  Yeah, I don't know.  So, you know, I don't know.  I don't know what the difference is, honestly, because I always thought it was the heirloom wheat and that there's a type of wheat. You would know this.  What is the zero zero zero zero zero zero. So it's on the on the Baggara. She says Tipo Tipu and then a zero zero. And that's a very fine ground, white flour. And you're normally for posse's you're blending that with semolina flour. So it's usually about a two thirds to one third ratio. And semolina is the Arizona hard.  No, no assembly. It's just another another version of what you know, what you're you're putting in that pasta to make those gluten stick together. And so that's to give it like a bite.  So, yeah. Chew to it. Yeah. Mhm.  Because there's a I don't remember the brand but I buy this particular spaghetti that's just goddamn delicious and it's from Italy and it's that zero zero mochi flour and it's just such a good pasta and that has a better effect on me than if I buy like a standard American brand.  Well you know that. Yeah. So if you're if you're buying dry pasta in the States and making your your food out of the dry pasta, you probably have a lot better results if you actually made your own fresh flour pasta offshore, right.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Fresh pasta is shit.  There's it's such a different taste.  Right. Yeah. Like pastas. I like pasta period. But fresh pasta like. Have you ever been to Feliks in Venice. No. Good Lord.  Next time you there you just bring your stuff.  Would you bring Felix in Venice. Let's start here. He must go to restaurants.  We're going to get to this other one in a minute. But shout out you remember Janet and heard me talk about Todd Top Box.  So he just wrote this is another book he just wrote for. It's like personal protection family production book. Awesome. We'll get to that in a minute.  OK, but I brought you some prepared. Yeah. You don't fuck around.  You have T-shirts. Yeah. Look, those are coolers that are cooler.  Yeah. This is your cooler. These are your T-shirts. But I brought you our olives. Oh olives. Couple couple wine glasses.  I realized at the studio we don't have your tarantula hawk that's at the old studio. We must bring it back. I'm leaving. We will have to leave it. Do not worry. What is this.  What are these beverages. Cider? Is this alcoholic? Yep, you're right. I know it's November, you know.  So sparkling cider, sparkling mead, sparkling white wine. Sparkling mead.  Yeah. Is it made with honey. Yeah. Whoa. I've never had that. No you will. What is that like. I was read about that in Narconon books. It's good.  It's great. It makes you want to, you know, crush your enemies, you know, natural enemies see them driven before you get a lot of nations of the women.  The women. Yeah, I think so. These are for you now.  Are these things that you are making. Yeah. These are all these are Pusser for wine plus for.  Why have you when did you start doing that. There's a couple of you needs a year and a half ago. Well yeah. What was the motivation behind that. I mean you were just taking up with your fucking wine convenience in your restaurants and your music and your three bands and you're right. Oh Jesus.  I got bored, so I decided to take it up a notch.  Yeah, you're. Yeah, you're a workaholic, my friend. Yeah. So that's for you. Thank you very much. But I'll here for you somewhere. Austin, I will send a photograph when I'm drinking, you know, November 1st because this is for your marijuana cigarette.  Oh, dude, you won't be able to fit your bongs, your bongs in here.  Don't use the bongs and the bong bong won't fit.  Oh, that's a dope.  But this is this is for your marijuana cigarettes or your or your mushrooms, as it were. That's a legit lunchbox.  Yeah, I had a lunch spot, my last lunch box I had was in the seventh grade, eighth grade, seventh grade, eighth grade, I moved to a bad neighborhood and I realized you can't wear lunch, you can't bring lunch boxes to school or kids get very upset with you. So this is this is for you as well. This is Todd's new book, Protection for From Humanity, and I'll let you read up on that point from.  Yeah, so he's the one that got me into doing the moiety stuff. And now for his book, he's actually this is kind of his promotional item he is doing with the book is like in gloves.  He's making his own gloves. Yeah, he's having them made, I'm sure. But thanks for him. I don't know. Find out. OK, nice.  You like this? Yeah. Now you've only been doing mithai for how long?  No, not even a year. And no problems with the hip because, you know, I mean, there's a there's a weird shift that happens in the hip. I got one of those little hammer thingies there, you know, the little electric massager things. Yeah. So that's weird. Oh no. Those are good. There are guns.  Yeah. So, yeah. So what happens is if I go a little too far, what's happening is my, my hip joint kind of just shifts forward a little bit and starts pinching something and I just stand on my left foot.  Is that hammer on the hip done where I can get back to work. Kind of a cyborg. Kind of a cyborg. A little bit.  Now did they give you a full hip replacement or is it just a full surfacing full hip? Wow. Yeah. What is the like? John Wayne? PA just got a hip resurfacing and there's videos of him. Twelve weeks after surgery, kicking the pads. Now, for they were telling me, like, I can't remember specifically, but I want to say it was three months before I actually got back on the mats, they were like, you're not going to want to do that for six months, but you can probably start getting back and doing some things in three months.  That's 12 weeks.  And of course, nine weeks you get a little itchy and you want to get out there and do stuff. So, yeah.  So you slowly moved around a little bit. Yeah.  If you're doing just some some basic positional drills and just doing that kind of stuff, you're fine. But, you know, sparring is a, you know, then you're heavy loads and you being a dumb ass. Yeah.  It's the one where they hack off the top of the hip bone. They put a fake top and then they screw it deep in the bone. And that kind of has to stay with you forever. Yeah, because they can't really do that again right now. And that's it. You're done. But I have a weapon.  So if something happens, as long as I can balance on one foot, you pull it out, I can pull this thing out.  It's like a big blade in the middle of my bone and I can jam it into your jugular.  Right. Look at those canes and turn into a sword. Yes.  Or umbrella's don't recommend the the pain that you must have been in to agree to do that had to be pretty goddamn system.  Yeah, well, the guy said like and it was a lot of stomping on the stage that I pretty much damaged my right hip, not my left, because I did a lot of stomping with my right foot.  Did you feel pain while you were stomping? No, it was like, you know, years late. That's like, you know, a decade or more of doing that. And then I just thought that I was being a wimp, that I wasn't, you know, healing or I was didn't push through it or whatever, or I wasn't working out enough. But maybe they actually got in there, like, did you have like a gobstopper for a hip?  So you're there's no padding. There's nothing. It's it looks it's like a mangled sock of pomace.  All of the gone. Yeah. Gone. It was just like. All the cartilage chewed up. Yeah, yeah, so there was no possible hope for stem cells or, you know, they were like that, like they just take that off the table.  That was what it was like.  That was you've had this like this for seven years, minimum, the amount of damage that was on the on the on the ball joint, they were like, this is we're not we're surprised you weren't in here sooner. Really? Yeah.  And were you limping at all when you were walking? Yeah. It was just all of a sudden fire off.  And I couldn't because I remember you saying you were doing drills and you couldn't move your hip. Right. And you thought like you had like a hip impingement or something. Mm hmm.  No, it was just there was I didn't have a hip. Yeah. Good times.  Michael Bisping just got both of his knees replaced. Ouch. He's like 43, I believe. Yeah.  I don't think he's much older than that, but he's had some some monsters kicking them.  So, you know, there's that. But it's also running. He runs a lot. OK, yeah, I ran in high school and he runs on the concrete, I believe now where he runs. Well, I know he's got a love of running.  They have concrete and a lot of places. So it could be anywhere.  Could be it could be anywhere else. Yes. But, you know, when you see a guy who's in his early 40s getting his knees completely replaced.  Yeah, that's terrifying. So what do you think went on with? Is there something similar with bone structure and those kind of replacements that happened with Silvas, Anderson, Silvas, Shin? Was it just like.  No, he just Bader's checked like the one Weidemann checked it. He most likely cracked it on the first one and then the second one, he threw it again and just snapped in half because.  But I mean, after so after he healed and then went back out and he started having some leg problems like a year later, even though was healed like it was just wasn't healed enough or it takes a long time to heal a fracture like that when a bone snaps.  And if you remember Franconia, when Franconia got hit by a car, he was on his motorcycle to get hit by a car. He was not the same for years. He tried to fight again. I think it was like a year and a half ish. Later after the accident, he wasn't the same. It took it took quite a long time for the old friend. And maybe, you know, you'd have to ask him, maybe never really was the same again.  But there's something about leg bones when they snap. First of all, you got to think you can't put any weight on them for a long time. So you've got all this atrophy. So all the tissue around it atrophies. Right. And that's got to rebuild. So you've got to rebuild that while you're also trying to make sure that the bone is fully recovered and while you're pushing it, who knows what kind of damage you're going to do to the tendons and the ligaments.  And, you know, it takes a long time unless you're doing some shit, unless you're on some steroids, it takes a long time to build that muscle back up as well.  So there's a lot going on there, which is in a way, it's the not the opposite, but for the hip replacement, they had us walking like within an hour walk just to make sure you have the news.  You won't wake up. They have you walking.  Yeah, that is a weird Graham Hancock was in here, not here. The only other place six weeks after a hip replacement. And he was walking around and I was like, that is good. You're walking like normal. This is crazy. Yeah. Yeah. They just make sure you start walking to make sure that you minimize the amount of atrophy.  Yeah, he I know Anderson got his knee blown out. I think it was Jared cannoneers in that fight. Yeah. But in your head so fucking hard that could have happened at any point in time in his career, you know. All right. It's amazing. More guys don't have their knees blown out by Lukacs, you know.  You know, now doing more tie, someone kicks your leg like I'm sure I know Anthony Hardonk over at the guy's terrorises.  We've got we got video of, like, some dude going, seriously, just just kick my leg. I want to see what this is all about. And things like, you don't want that seriously kicking my leg kick like guy crying.  He's on the ground crying and things like, you fucking asked me to do that.  What you you so big. Hardonk was big for a heavyweight. I you're a fucking Dutchman. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Those those shins to the thigh. It's it's one of the most underrated pains. Yeah. It's terrifying to ask a guy to do that.  And, you know, I'm going to I'm going to pursue that a little bit. Just I'm not going to ever use it for anything. But I just like I just like that next level of awareness of striking awareness.  Yeah.  Yeah. But the one thing I haven't done is I haven't gotten with an instructor to go just teach me how to not get hit like just that, just that awareness of seeing what's coming and starting to understand the sequence of events that are going to lead up to that strike. Then you have of course, in the UFC of unconventional strikers that are going to come at you from angles you didn't expect. But in general, just and not really because I want to get in a fight just because I want to have that extra part of my brain exercised to wonder just to actual reaction.  I know it's one. Like if you say, I want to learn how to play piano, someone doesn't say, what are you going to play in concerts? They don't say that. But if you say I want to learn more time. Oh, you're going to fight.  Yeah. So tomorrow, like to learn it.  It's a it's a skill. Yeah. It's like, you know, I'd like to learn how to do a back handspring. I'd like to learn to do a lot of things right. Just seems like a cool thing to learn. But that's one of those things. If you if you even say you want to learn it, people like. Right. Why do you want to learn that?  What are you going to fight people. Right. Like, no, it's an interesting thing. First of all, it's cool. Right. You know, and it's an interesting thing to know, but so your coach doesn't work with you.  But really, I don't really have a coach done at the moment because it was just Todd was kind of he and I were the ones going around the world and training with insane instructors are really good, really good coaches. So you get also he's a practitioner, but he's not a coach.  Well, Todd's a black, you know, black belt under Rodrigo Farje for Brazilian jujitsu. But he and I caught the he got the bug before I got the bug. He he made me catch the bug.  So, you know, with his connections traveling all the time as he did, he would have insane instructors. And then this instructor would introduce you to that instructor when you go into that town. So we had great it was really cool to meet these people. But the problem that I was having was, you know, when you're trying to have Carlos Condit teach you how to do something, he's like four feet taller than I am.  And like, it doesn't what he does isn't necessarily going to translate to me. So you could see him struggling to go. How do I explain this to you as a midget? Like, how do you I don't know how to make this work for you, because it works for me because I have length and I have an entire history of of being, you know.  Well, a lot of the ties are very short, you know. Yeah.  So that's why I love when you get to, like, someplace like New Zealand, it has short people, beaten fuckers up. That's great. So, you know, in there my height. So I got a lot more out of out of that stuff in in Australia, New Zealand. Have you been to Thailand now. Have not yet been.  That would be a move. Once everything opens up, go there and do some training there. There's a lot of people that go to Phuket because they have it set up where, you know, you could stay there, you could train there. And one of my business managers went there. He spent six days there just just doing nothing but training and just enjoying it was going there and working out with, like, real Thai coaches. Every day. Guys barely speak English.  Yeah, they've had 300 fights and they'll show you how to do everything. Old school, Thai, you know, classic Moatize down.  We did. I think we did it in Copenhagen. We went to an awesome gym there. This guy barely spoke English, but he's he was he could still instruct you because, you know, he's pointing and grunting.  Yeah, well, also, you mirror you know, you see how they do it, you know, they'll say, look, look, look, they'll do it like, OK, right.  You feel so dumb when you when you watch someone is like, really good at Moyet. I like this.  It's so effortless, you know, it's so graceful. It's a really interesting art form, you know, because there's really only a few kicks.  Like, they just got down to mostly roundhouse kicks, a couple of Sidekick's Tepes, you know, front kicks and that's about it. Everything else is like they unless they're going to do a cartwheel kick or some shit, they're learning that from other people or just playing around and having fun.  But the art itself, when it comes down to the kicking butt, because they have that they they've got it down to like this smoothness. And if the efficiency.  Yeah, the part that's really eluded me is that because I don't have enough hours in doing it, I don't I don't really have the like, you know, French have the liaison of this words kind of slides into that that transition of understanding.  You're not going you can't throw that kick because you didn't do the thing before that set you up in the position to be in a position to throw that kick. Right.  So that kind of stuff is is very interesting and complicated and and in a way, it kind of just I stop. I'm like in my head too much going. OK, wait a minute.  I always equated to like a vocabulary. When you talk to someone who's very articulate, they have a lot of words, their disposal, they have a lot they have a deep understanding of how the language works.  Whereas if you talk to a child, they can say some things, but it's kind of crude.  And that's how most people are when it comes to martial arts. You're in the beginning in particular. You're basically like a child. Yeah, crude, clumsy with your words, whereas you talk to a master, you know, someone like Butko or something like that.  Like there's the fluency, the the fluidity, the efficiency of the movements. It's just such a beautiful thing to watch. Yeah.  Always in the right position, you know, like one of my favorites for sure. If you ever watch Giorgio Petrosian fight. No. Oh, my God. You got to watch that guy fight.  He is. I may have doctors always it was always sending me videos of do. You got to watch this guy fight, so he most likely has sent me videos of Petrosian at one point in time when he was 23, I think it was 43 a.. And like some 35 knockouts or something like that, by the time I was 23, beaten a shitload of world mithai champions.  And if you have the UFC fight pass, you obviously fight passes is great because it has not just UFC fights, but it has a shitload of other promotions, including It's Showtime, It's Showtime, goes way back to like the early 2000s, like 20 years ago.  And it's Showtime was the precursor to glory. OK, I want to go.  I am wearing a green shirt a day and glory is like the premiere kickboxing that of today.  Right.  So Petrosian, I think, still fights for glory. But Petrosian, when he was in his 20s, you could catch those on UFC fight pass. I just was watching it yesterday in the gym. I was watching him when he was 23 and it's probably like. It's probably deep in his 30s now, I think it's probably 37 or something like that, but he's been around forever and he is just one of the smoothest, most elegant fighters to watch, but ruthlessly effective.  But his technique is just perfect. He's always in a perfect position and he's a guy.  If you watch him train constantly drilling, just drill, drill, drill over and over and over again and, you know, do situational drills and positional drills. And so his footwork and everything is all second nature. Like when the guy comes to him, he steps aside, left hook, right kick.  And like all these techniques that that flow together so perfectly in a match, you can watch him rehearse them over and is a ton of videos on YouTube and watch him watch him train. But they call him the doctor because like literally like he it's like he's doing something different than all these other guys are doing.  And when you're talking like world champions and he was kail them when he was in his early 20s while to watch, just because it's like what is he doing different?  Like, it's hard to see. Like if you watch Mike Tyson in his prime, it's pretty obvious what he's doing different.  You know, you watch Roy Jones Junior and it's pretty obvious faster than everybody. Ridiculous. Left to you're seeing at all with Giorgio. It's like, how is he able to do this to these guys? Like his understanding of position of when to be there and when to not be there. It's just second to none.  So and so, you know, the transition we're talking, you know, that's kind of the part that's always eluded, even with jujitsu, like those in between, when you kind of lose the fight, like, you know, the match kind of lose it.  So, you know, we ended up here. So Ortega, this last fight, then Ortega did, I felt like the the thing that really was like surprising to me was not necessarily that he's like, oh, now you've trained striking and you're doing really well at the strike. And it was like those in between things that he was doing that I was like, yes, I've never I haven't seen that most U.S. fighters like just that in-between thing that he put the glue together to.  He wasn't leaving any holes.  There's no holes. Yeah, no no holes. It was brilliant.  That was a masterful performance because that guy, the Korean zombie Chanson Joung, is very dangerous, very dangerous.  And Brian neutralized him. He neutralized everything. And he looked so smooth and professional like everything he was doing. It looked so good. Yeah.  And Korean zombie said he doesn't remember anything of the last three rounds, doesn't remember them because remember he got hit with that back by the elbow. Yeah. Yeah. He got Kayode and apparently he was just on autopilot for the rest of the fight doesn't he says very embarrassed. Doesn't even remember the fight. Wow. Yeah. That happens sometimes guys get Kayode and they'll go back to their corner like, is it the second round?  It's the fifth round. And like it is. Yeah, it's the fifth round. Come on, man, you're losing the fight like I am. All right. I thought it just started like they literally don't remember fights and it's because they're literally concussed.  You get bumped while they're inside the ring.  Luckily, there's no you know, when we're doing shows, I'm not getting bonked. So if you lose track of the show, you don't know what song you're on that's happened.  That's actually a good thing because you're like you're in you're in the zone. You're actually like you've kind of disappeared into that story you wrote. You're no longer thinking about the story you wrote. You're just you're now just delivering the story unconsciously but consciously or accepting in the Puscifer lunchbox.  Got some of that good marijuana cigarette that will do it. There's been many a show where I'm in the middle of a bit going, what bit is this?  Yeah, you generally just takes a second look. Oh, yeah. Airplane. Airline. Yeah, keep talking. Keep talking.  You're good. But the the shows that you do, have you ever been in a situation where you're in the middle of a song and you're you're so in the groove that you kind of forget what song. I don't know where I am.  Yeah. Because you're so in it, you're in the middle of it.  But then you make that mistake of thinking about it or having a memory of like, oh, like a week ago I fucked this song up and as soon as you thought, you're like, you know, interesting about live performances.  Yeah. Well that's kind of why, you know, that's kind of why you do those. Yeah. But so this thing we got coming up is not it's a we already recorded it, we filmed it at A.S.A. and Woody's aka S.A.S..  This is this insane concrete village that was going to get his name wrong. Apollo So Solari looked it up. Buddy Hollow Syllabary Apollo.  He was a student of Frank Lloyd Wright. So he built this foundry in the middle of the desert on your way up to Flagstaff from Phoenix. It's kind of off the seven. And it's what purpose for bells they make these kind of bell structures and they make, you know, so there's a kind of a school to you can go attend to understand how to do foundry work, but also concrete, just understanding these concrete structures. And so thousands, all these locations and there's there's kind of a school there.  There's there's people who come through and travel.  There you go. So, Larry, is there an image of this place yet?  Look up, Arko Assante. I suspect that a are CEO, Akio Essaying S.A.. How did you find out about this place? Oh, it's right near my house. It's like an hour away. Oh, how fucking cool is that spot? Holy shit, man. Yeah. So that's all concrete. Yeah. Fuck.  So, you know, the added pressure, like when you're playing live, it's just a live show. There's pressure because, you know, you're playing live, but there's not a lot of pressure because when it goes by, you're the next song. Don't worry about it.  But when you're playing live in front of a camera and it's going to capture you fucking up, that's a lot of pressure. So we filmed a couple like two weeks ago. We filmed the entire album. We did all the songs in these in these structures.  And did you have an outdoor audience? No, it was there was no audience for it because we had to do what we were doing it like mostly at night, like early rising, late rising. It was quite it was not easy to do, especially in is this thing supposed to be kind of this integrated with the natural terrain. So you've got you've got rattlesnakes and shit everywhere.  Like it's you're you're living in the desert. You're 360 views are the wilderness, the hostile environment. So and no audience. And then you're still an audience and singing. So but it's also hot. It's also cold.  It's also like there's like there's black widows and, you know, so you're you know, you're it's kind of a not an easy thing to do, especially when you're trying to catch the sunrise and you want the song to land right on as the sun's coming up over the horizon, like all those kind of things that that and it's like 6:00 a.m. Park.  So you were recording as the sun was coming up. Yeah. On Song one song. But like then you're you're trying to catch other things with the stars on the other songs and it's all timing and, you know, am I going to get bit did that sounds like I'm tired and I'm sure it sucked while you were doing that and getting up.  But the overall product.  Yeah, I'm pretty I'm pretty stoked about it. And so that's what we're doing is that's a that's that's streaming on the same day that the album comes out on the 30th. And what's it streaming on?  I don't know what the actual service it is, but it's Puscifer live. Dotcom is where you go to get a ticket to see it. And I think it's it's the same one that did I want to say it's the it's the same service that Mr Bungalow's doing. I think Mr Bungalow's shows the day after hours. So it's the same service and. I don't know, but it's available on the Puscifer website now, it's Puscifer Levkoff. It's a separate web.  Is there a link to it on Puscifer dot com?  There should be on the main page. But if you just go to post for most of her life dotcom, that's where that takes you.  There was a form in the new album in its entirety from Arkansas in the Arizona desert. Dude, that is such a great idea. I love it.  Well, you know, this whole lockdown thing not being able to tour. This is our tour. This is it. So.  Yeah, it's been a weird one, right, in the fact that everybody was like, oh, you know, around June, we'll probably be fine, not here. It is November almost. Yeah.  And I think the big thing, like, you know, kind of circling back is I'm still feeling residual effects of that thing.  And I feel like there's a bunch of people that that maybe I didn't almost die. I have friends who almost died.  I do as well as ugly. So.  And then you have people going. You guys are apparently I'm being paid to say this. Eat a dick, dude.  You can't pay attention to those people. Those those are people who think that five G is killing babies. People are out of their fucking minds. There's so much noise out there.  It's so hard. It's so hard to pay attention. It's so it's so hard to try to separate. I have two friends that came real close to dying and then I have other friends that shook it off like it was nothing. I have a couple of friends that didn't even know they had it. They tested positive. They said I didn't feel a thing. Jamie was sick for a day and he was convinced it was ragweed. Yeah, yeah. But my friend Michael Yo, he came really close.  He was in the hospital for quite a long time. And my friend, Dr. Neil Reardon, he was in the hospital. It came very close to death a couple times. And he you know, I think folks that got it early on before they knew how to treat it correctly and what was going on, what do they got their asses handed to him, you know?  Sure. Our friend Dean, his family. And I'm going to get this wrong. So I'm sure Dean is going to let me out. But I think his wife tested positive. The kids tested positive. He tested positive. I think the parents tested positive. Then. Nobody showed any symptoms, he showed symptoms on a Tuesday, finally got into the hospital, almost died on a Sunday, then recovered quickly after because he was in shape.  He's like mid 40s. He does. He's a runner. Like he's he's not out of shape.  But like there was a TOUCH-AND-GO moment where he couldn't speak to you, couldn't talk to you on Sunday like that. So on Tuesday showed symptoms, you know, not fucking cool at all on a Sunday and then came out of it.  So meanwhile, Fatso Trump, 74 years old, eating French fries, takes it in a weekend back on the campaign trail. It looks a hundred times better than Biden. They got him on steroids and Adderall.  He looks great. He looks great. I'm thinking about trying Adderall now. Yeah, he looks so good.  It's amazing. Yes. I'm give a speech other day. I'm like, the guy has never looked better. Like covid like literally he had a hermetic effect.  Yeah. And his body's actually stronger because of Kovac still ridgeback.  Oh yeah. Probably more. Yeah. Because now he thinks he's immune. Do you have to worry anymore. Yeah.  You know now he can go have people spit in his mouth. Yeah. Please. And he's fine. It's ok. It's so weird.  At least the world doesn't seem real. You know, it just it seems like you have to remind yourself, OK, this is still real. This is the world. Yeah.  You know, but I think that's kind of what you know, you had those good you had those good aunts, those good Unkles good friends.  When you're a kid that you kind of learn there's a lot of influence you get from your parents. You know, my dad is, you know, my whole world as far as influence a good influence on decision making. Right.  But you also have those people around you that you should have around you if they're positive that it's should be fairly easy to see right through bullshit and get to the core of a good decision. Should it? Should it should. But now with this fucking thing on the phone, it's just it's it's very strange to think to the information you're getting to make. That decision has been picked apart and it's all dopamine dump. Yeah. Charged. So you can't really.  It's sensationalized conversations start with an argument. Mm hmm. I really like I really like Frosted Flakes.  And if you don't like Frosted Flakes, fuck, you must be racist. Yeah. You must be racist to be a bigot.  Yeah.  I had Alan Levine events on the podcast and he had a really he's actually working on a book about this now, but it was a series of tweets that he put up about what we're dealing with, with social media is the same thing that we're dealing with, with processed food, processed food, with all these preservatives. It fills you up. It's terrible for you. He's like, this is processed information.  This is not how human beings are supposed to process exchange information and it's supposed to get it in this two hundred and eighty character forms should be a facial is a process you go through to digest the information.  Well, it should be. People are supposed to talk like this, supposed to be one of the things that people love about podcasting. It is a digital thing and you're getting in and it's kind of impersonal in a way, but it's also kind of personal because you and I are having a personal moment and it's recorded like we're in front of each other, we're looking at each other, and this is how people are and we're nice to each other. In the end, you say something that I consider it and we talk and you you get in real time to exchange information back and forth and see how the other person responds to it and then respond to their response.  That's how people are supposed to talk, man. And this Twitter thing that people are doing the most mentally ill people I know spend the most time on Twitter and they're on it ranting and raving and blaming all these other people for their unhappiness.  And it's it's so weird to see. It's so it's it's like you're watching people self their self inflicting themselves with venom. Yeah.  That's why I kind of like what's you know, one of the things that I noticed when I got into the wine industry is that you have all these different walks of life, various political bents, various religious bents, you know, just various cultures, all kind of coming together in this thing. And I don't I don't have in my circle of people. I don't I can talk we can all talk to each other and all of those all of those cultures are represented, all those political beliefs, all those religious beliefs, all those things are all represented in all the people that we deal with.  And we have these civil conversations with each other face to face. We're all busting our asses. We're all doing a thing. There's a puzzle we're trying to solve. There's a problem we've encountered that I don't know how to solve and you know how to solve it. I'm trying to build this thing and you're very good at building this thing.  We're solving puzzles and you have a core common ground. Yeah, yeah. We have a core common ground from just just from life. We're just we're making a living.  You have a living and we're just talking. We're talking.  Well, I always felt as you go here when you're anonymous, it turns into this fucking ugly fight of polarized mess of like you have to pick a side and it's like, yeah, you're on the wrong side.  I'm standing like the only thing we're really kind of massaging and trying to work around and picking a side on is whether is Mother Nature.  You're just trying to she smacks the shit out of you and you're trying to fucking navigate it is so that she's in charge and you are not in charge.  And so that's the thing about having a common having a common thing that you do like jujitsu. Like if you train jujitsu, you're going to have Republicans and Democrats and progressives and and libertarians, they're all going to be training together. And, you know, they'll laugh and smile at disagreements they have because the agreement they have is that jujitsu is awesome. Right. So they're in there trying to choke each other. And and this stuff is like, I can choke if I don't agree with you, I can just disagree with, then I get the choke you.  But it's just it's not as important as the jujitsu, you know, it's like right somewhere along the line, it became like, you have to be on my side or fuck you.  And that these ideological echo bubbles that people these. Chambers that people get into, it's just. It's never before happened where you've had people that can so readily find people that agree with them wholeheartedly and have full confirmation bias, like only only people that are on this side in this that believe these things in this core group. And it's real obvious, like it's real cut and dry, what they believe and what they want, what they see and what they don't.  And then it's reinforced by CNN and MSNBC and FOX News and, you know, all these biased news sources.  And if there is a division, I guess, that I would make it would be fundamentalism versus fucking chillout ism.  No, it's because people are so you're you're far left in your far right are bumping each other's asses on the other side of the circle. They're the same.  They're they're all one fucking stroke away from Handmaid's Tale. And they are burning books together.  Yes. Telling you what pronouns to use and what religion you're supposed to pick and write all this stuff. They're the same person. They're the same people.  And we're in the middle going, I, I just want some pasta.  It's super simple, super similar.  And it's all coming together with this pandemic because people are being forced to be locked away. You're locking away, you're staying away from people. So you have less interaction, less actual real contact with people, more digital contact, more processed bullshit ways of communicating with people. And then there's the fear and then there's the lack of money because everybody's out of work.  And then there's all this panic that comes with that and this anger and anxiety and. Existential angst of the disease itself and the combination of all these factors, together with a fucking douche bag for a president. Chaos and no good choices for opponents. You know, everybody's just voting. The people that are not voting for Trump, they're just voting for not Trump. They're not voting for Joe Biden. No one's super excited about Joe Biden. They're voting for not Trump.  So you sitting there like if you're an observer watching this, like we got to get out of here like this, this is going to blow.  OK, I think you start to default back to the position of OK, well, I'm just to step back and just see in my lifetime, what haven't we seen. OK, well, in my lifetime we haven't seen a female black president. So if you're voting for Biden, in a way, you have to be a little honest about it. You're actually voting for Kamala Harris because it's very possible she's going to be the next president. Possible, right.  100 percent.  But is she an awful person? Is she a bad person? She's a good person. I don't know. I just know that it's a step forward.  It's a it's something that hasn't happened before me. And I get to be alive when we've when we have a female president.  Well, we've never had a Nazi president either, really step forward. Well, we already have that. Oh, I don't think he's a Nazi.  He's kind of Jewish son in law. I hope he announces. His son in law, though, is the Antichrist.  You're seeing him next to Damien. Have you ever seen. That's great.  From the movie Go. We've done it multiple times. Come on. But it's up to him and Damien from the movie Damien The Omen.  Look at the two of them together. Oh, there he is.  He's the Antichrist. Yeah. Yeah. So it's not like the devil sons, devil son in law, son.  So well, son in law. That's what it is. I like it. Or maybe he's the devil son. Right, Trump son law. Yeah.  Maybe he's got like there's a he's got the handle. Maybe just a nice guy with great hair and a beautiful suit and you're just making it up. Yeah. Maybe he's just got really good bone structure and I'm jealous.  Could be that a beautiful wife that happens to be Trump's daughter. Maybe that maybe I'm just a bitch. Could be that.  But so you see a photo but you got a picture of him. Look at the two of them next to each other. Damian, Damian. The Omen. The Omen.  God damn it, Brian, you're not that young. You should know who the fuck. How old are you, man? Forty six. You should fucking know who the Omen is, bro.  Oh yeah. Look at the the the fifth photo over.  Yeah. Just say that's some years. Like, come on son.  He's, he's actually right now not looking at the camera, he's talking to the wolves across the fence right on the other side.  I'm just making eye contact. Yeah. Yeah.  I mean delivering a message shot literally is straight out of the ollman. Yeah. Damien in The Omen, Jared Kushner, Google those two things together and go to images.  I've seen it.  We've pulled it up multiple times on this podcast. It's 100 percent accurate. Jared Couchman. Watch this. I spoke Couchman images. There you go, you go there and watch this, no.  Who's that guy? Well, he's famous now. Is it Kushner, right? Yeah, we were. Yeah. Here. There's got to be an image of wear down.  Oh yeah. Down on the bottom. Yeah. Look, come on, son. I mean, that's the old man. That's him. That is him.  Now go back to the images again and there's one with him. It's like a portrait mode with up there, right? Right above that one. Right above that one. Click on that.  It's like a trump is blurry. And look at him.  The devil, he's got his hand right up his top, it seems like making him say the Satan thing.  We are so close, so close, so close to the final confrontation. I just think maybe I'm just being a bitch.  Orders from goat's blood on Amazon.  A really handsome man with a slender neck and a beautiful wife. Maybe I should just shut the fuck up. Maybe. Maybe it's me, man. Probably you. Probably you. No matter who gets in that office, they get skewered. Yeah, I was interested to see what they say about Bernie. I was really hoping we could see what would happen if that guy would get in place. That was that was interesting to me.  What would happen if somebody got in place and said, you know what, we're going to make college free.  We're going to completely absolve you of student debt. We're going to make Medicare for all. We're going to raise the minimum wage to fifteen dollars an hour. All those things that I'm not an economist, maybe it wouldn't have worked, but I was interested to see I'm like, that seems to be a good use of taxpayer money.  Like if you're going to use taxpayer money and most of them are using it for.  Well, the problem now is if you want if you want to know that scenario, you don't have anybody who is going to go, OK, let's honestly look at it and we're going to present the case for for against in the middle, like what the possibilities might be. You don't have anybody that's going to actually be loud enough to tell you the answer that you're that you're.  Yeah, it was only Bernie. Yeah. They were like this. But as far as like actually somebody breaking it down, because if you try to Google that, what does that information, all this shit's going to be in the way talking about, you know, socialism and or whatever.  You don't know. And I and I'm not necessarily for Bernie. I'm just saying I don't know because I can't find the the paper that isn't biased to present that argument to me.  Well, to me, it was pretty shocking that the only people that I was interested at all were blocked out by the system. Tulsi Gabbard, Bernie Sanders, Andrew Young, those are the only people I was interested in. And they were completely blackballed and pushed out by the system, like, fuck you, you know.  So, you know, normally when you're to find something out about a history of a place, you kind of follow the money to release records.  So follow follow the follow the reason, you know, why were they so who's who's blocking them out and why would they be blocking them out and follow that and follow that breadcrumb trail to see why I just want it to be over.  Yeah.  And I want civil war to be here already. So I know how many votes tomorrow.  It's like Tuesday roughly. Seems like it's coming. Yeah. Seems like it's coming, but I feel like this is a good place to be.  First of all, this is a very neutral ground because it's a blue spot in a red state. It really is. Yeah. Yeah. And a red room in Arizona is it seems like it's well on paper and you never know.  The polls don't mean shit. But, you know, they're saying Biden's ahead in Arizona, which is possible. I don't know.  But like, that's a red state because where I'm where I live, that's all day long. You've got to do like with the Trump flag driving around on the car. And it's like, I can we just have a coffee? Can we just talk? But not for freedom.  Fuck yeah. Fuck you for freedom. It's just it's it's what can we just how can we not hugin.  Yeah. And then you're in a fight because you don't like fuck you. Didn't you fucking hope for freedom. Too busy sucking cock huh. Yeah.  Like for, for enslavement. I suck cock for enslavement. I'm into it. Some people are into that.  They want you to tie them up now what do you do.  It's, it's a confusing time too because a lot of these states that we're red are getting infiltrated by people like me that are abandoning the the blue states.  They're abandoning California, but taking with them their shitty voting habits. Yeah, like, I'm going to go to this place with freedom and then just take it all away and.  Well, you don't need that many guns. And what are you going to do? Do whatever you want? No, I didn't seem right. We need some regulation and then, yeah, it all becomes California. Yeah.  That's you know, there are things and it is funny, the business that I'm in there in the alcohol business, it's almost it's completely contrary to what you would think about the people who are like less government, less regulation, less all those things like that when it comes to wine and and, you know, that kind of thing. In Arizona, it's the it's very California. They're like they want to control everything you're doing. They want to know every move you're making.  There's all these hoops you got to jump through to get things done. It's it's funny how so in what way?  Just just in the regulation of alcohol, how they interpret, you know, they're very lax. Arizona in general. Yeah. And specifically. Yeah. For for the winemaker. And there's a lot of hoops we have to jump through as winemakers.  Comes to Texas, bro. You can make wine with a gun.  You fuck Fredricksburg right out here man. Not far from here. Yeah. They have great wine. Yeah. Allegedly not much shit about one. I like, I like your wine.  Yeah I know it tastes good. You're going to like more of my one. Oh shit. I like her first.  I like your wine. I just don't know why I like it. You know.  I've seen salaries made with love. That too. Have you seen Sour Grapes, the documentary. No. Yes, parts of it haven't seen I haven't. It's pretty amazing. That's what I keep hearing. It's amazing that this guy made fake wine that was supposed to be these really expensive bottles and duped all these like real one on his Zula.  So when I first heard about the film, I was under the impression like I sat next to that guy I was that was at a Australian consulate wine dinner in Beverly Hills with Peter Gilgo from Penfold's sitting next to me.  And that guy was sitting, what is that guy's name?  Sour grapes. Sour grapes. The documentary Ruby Ruby Reuben. Yeah. So he he was I met that guy sitting next to him. I didn't buy any wine from him, luckily, but, you know, I met him.  So initially I was like, you know, fuck that guy for, like, duping all these people.  But the thing that they're they're basically saying was that, yeah, that aside, yeah, he fucked a lot of people up, but his ability to do what he was doing to put these wines in bottle and mimic what the palate, the just the nature, the color, everything about and being able to duplicate the the what's in the bottle to the point where it would fool Asalam.  He was like, he's an alchemist. Like he was really good at like making Hoogland just like putting wine in a bottle and selling you the bottle.  Like if you opened it and you tasted you thought you really thought it was that wine, you would go that's seems like a that seems like not a great version of that one, but that's that wine. Oh, so you could tell that it was slightly in some cases that's that's, you know, try any of this one.  No, no, I'm kind of would want to try it. But they were just saying the guy really was able to get close to mimicking the palettes and structure that he's wearing. So that's why. What's his name again?  Brian. Rudy Kamiyama. I said Ruby Kernohan or hear him or Courville. Hmm. Kurniawan, Kerney, Kurniawan, tinea one, Rudy Kurniawan, OK, Rudy, interesting.  So how did this guy do this?  Like if, you know, if it's such a fine art to create a great wine and I know you. I've tried.  Well, the thing is, your wines from what he was doing, you know, and I'm just I'm speculating on this. I haven't seen the film.  But what he was doing was just to for you right now, that wine might not last in that bottle once.  Oh, so it's not going to it's not going to hold up. It's not the structure. It's not the structure of wine.  I mean, he was literally putting dirt and things in to create that initial impression so that when you taste it to investigate it, you know, OK, I think that's what that is.  And then he write the check and he's like, Page, there is a fucking great book that I am in the middle of that you would love that's based on.  But you can read this one next, right? Yes, I'll read that one.  It's my friend Graham Hancock wrote the foreword to it, and then it's Bryan Burrough Rescues book.  And here we go. It's right here. It's called the Immortality Key and Whips, and it is all about ancient wine and the ancient Greeks, how they used they put all kinds, you know, if you don't mind.  Yeah. The immortality key. This is the. Other got it right. And it's a really just listen to the podcast, the recent podcast that I did with this guy. It's amazing. He's a scholar of the Greek classics and Greek history, and he focused on the.  What did they call it, Louisianian mysteries? OK, where they would they have these rituals where they would all elucidates and they would all get together and they would have these rituals where they would drink this spiked wine and the wine was they they've proven now the wine was spiked with LSD, like component's was spiked with ergot. And they believe with probably a bunch of other different psychedelics, maybe psilocybin, maybe a bunch. But it was wines that had these psychedelic compounds and they would have these incredible rituals and people would go there.  And this is like literally like the foundation of Western civilization came from these these rituals. And then these rituals were forbidden by the Roman emperors. And then they started doing these rituals outside of Greek, outside of Greece, and they started doing them in Spain and they found images of them doing it in Italy and they found residue of these substances in pottery and they proven that it traveled all over the place. But what was fascinating to me is that their wine was never just wine.  They would put all sorts of different things in the wine. And like wine was in that back then was not just simply grapes that were fermented. They would add cinnamon and honey and all these different things to the wine, which I thought was really fascinating.  OK, yeah, but the fact that it was the source of their psychedelic rituals was wine.  All right. I'm going to read that. Yeah.  What's the podcast? OK, it's it's he's really great at describing it and it's a very condensed thing.  And then to further go get into the book that you did, you watch the fantastic Fungai film. I haven't seen that yet. So I started watching. I was about halfway through my bestman. I've been kind of busy, but.  Well, you have 50 jobs. I would imagine you're a little and you have a family. I don't know if the fuck you do, it seems.  Well, my wife is a fucking badass. She's more of a badass than I am.  And she can she holds a lot of other things down that that I wouldn't be able to do without her. So we have a nice, symbiotic, energetic relationship. Yes.  If I find someone who is has that many jobs, they almost always have an awesome wife.  Yeah, she's amazing because I couldn't I could not do any of this shit without her. Absolutely.  That's a great thing, man. Have a great team like that. Because when I look at all the things you do on my restaurants, wines, now you're making mead.  And then I'm going to Michigan now to like meet with a couple of winemakers there because I'm going to probably put a facility there because my my dad's house is there. So I'm going to go elsewhere. I'm going at my dad's house.  Well, they're trying to kill Michigan, so it's a good place to go right now. They're literally at the governor's making everything fall apart.  I'm going to find out some land for like a buck. I'm going to fix it. Do it.  I'm going to go and I'm going to make Mead cider and possibly wine in Michigan.  I just had a friend come back from Michigan telling me horror stories, huh? No, not where I live. They look I look at my porch and there's like, you know, 16 acres of trees, you know, deer walking through your yard.  And I'm talking about I don't know, you're just repeating what other people tell you to do. Yeah. You pretend you know what he's saying. Yeah. So what part of Michigan upper right on Lake Michigan.  Oh, nice. And Mason County.  Oh. So that's pretty rural, right. Yeah. What why did you choose that area. That's where my dad was a teacher.  So I went there when I lived, when I, when I left Ohio and went to live with my dad in Michigan and that's where he was wrestling coach and teacher in western Michigan. So he built a house. He and Nick DataQuick, this big motherfucker, he and his sons and my dad built the house that I own now and in Scottsville. Oh, wow. Yeah. So that's that's why I'm going back to check in on the house. Look at these buildings that we've been looking at, uh, set up a situation.  So I have my friend Tim Waitz with me in the car. Nice. My winemaking partner. So we're going to we're just exploring a building. We're going to talk to some growers. There's definitely cider there. I mean, there's apples everywhere. And I can make mead, you know, tomorrow, because you can get honey, what keeps you motivated to constantly do like these new projects?  Another project like this puzzles.  I just fucking love puzzles.  Like, you know, physical, large scale sculptural and big space puzzles, so you think of like almost like constructing a new business or a warehouse or a factory like this or a creation like like an art piece.  Yeah, that and also watching what we just went through with this lockdown, you know, we have three greenhouses, so we were able to feed a bunch of people in our in our, you know, family, extended family with the businesses and everything. We were able to, like, provide a little bit of food, not not as much as they would need, but we certainly saved them at least one or two trips to the grocery store buying by providing them pasta that, you know, some of the fresh vegetables, a roll of toilet paper, you know, some soap like that kind of shit that they just couldn't get at the store.  We had to go through commercial channels to get some of this these materials.  That's a severely underrated pleasure to be able to provide for people. Yeah, I mean, it's so we were able to do that for over 100 families, you know, in our in our little circle. I want to build I want to build more of that. I want to do more that. So that's awesome.  So I think in a little town like, look, there's all these little towns all over the United States that dried up because they put the bypass in and put the Wal-Mart in the Home Depot out away from the little town. Beautiful structures, you know, solid buildings that just dried up. So you're now you're seeing a resurgence of these little towns turning around from what they were to being these little thriving things. And the kind of cornerstone of that stuff is, you know, food, lodging, restaurant, brewery or winery distillery.  You know, there's there's that little concentration of things. Old town, Cottonwood, Arizona, that's a hotspot for wineries, even though the vineyards and the winemakers are down and Willcocks or carcinoid or ELGAN one of their tasting rooms in this little old town that was just beat the shit like 15 years ago. You could you could, you know, pick up the property for, you know, they pay you to take it. But now it's like a little thriving metropolis because you have this concentration of restaurants and wineries in this one little spot.  That's interesting.  I think we're also starting to be aware of the value in having everything you need in close proximity where you're not shipping things in. Right. Like it used to be. Like the idea of Buy American was sort of this xenophobic, you know, semi racist notion that fuck the rest of the world, we're number one. But now people going, oh, but you know what? Wouldn't it be great if we can get our medicine here? We don't have to rely on boats that come over from China.  Like, wouldn't it wouldn't it be great if all the components that we need to make an automobile were actually manufactured and constructed right here?  Wouldn't it be great if a fuckin single cell phone was made in America? I mean, they don't make a goddamn one of them here. Everything is made in Asia.  I still think you're going to you're going to need to trade the trade routes, have to stay open. There's things that you can't do well or as well as somebody else in terms of just, you know, the spice trade was exactly that. You couldn't you couldn't grow these spices here you to get them from. So Idelsohn, they were desirable, you know, tulips in Holland, like, there's just there's something that's wanted and desired by other places.  And there's things you can do really well, for sure.  But it would be nice to be self-sustaining. Yes. Yes. Like, trade is always going to be significant and those end up being those end up being the side dishes that are like the icing on the cake in a way. But you should be able to figure out what grows in your area, what's sustainable in your area and what you know, what you can do to kind of like you don't have to shut your borders off. Just just be open to understanding that when the shit hits the fan, you guys kind of have a little self-contained thing that you can weather it.  Yeah, that would be nice. And this is this is a new feeling, which I never, never thought about that before.  But in the beginning of a lockdown, one of the things I was thinking was like, are we going to come to a point where we don't have enough food? Like how is the food going to get here? Is are people if they're not working, are they going to grow the food? What happens if the like the earlier predictions were terrifying?  Right. They're going to lose two million Americans like everybody is terrified that didn't come to pass.  But it was a moment where you're like, well, what if this gets way worse than that? Even like, how are we going to get to a point where there's no power or we're going to get so I mean, what are we relying on that's not necessarily going to be here when we think about what do we need to sustain ourselves? What are we relying on that may or may not be here if the shit hits the fan?  And I feel like this was kind of a practice run. Yes.  I feel like there's another one coming and you're going to have a shit ton of people that don't make it because they're like that first one was fake and this one is too cool. Can I can I get a set of keys to your house?  The thing it's so strange. So strange. I'm just got a friend a long time ago who had been in in Iraq. And he had taken some whatever he had to take for anthrax or whatever, and he used to joke like if we get hit with anthrax, it's going to affect you. It's not going to affect me. And I'm just going to tell you now I'm going through your pockets.  So no offense.  Yeah, I, I think this is a practice run and. I wonder, you know, I wonder how many people are going to relax again after this is over because of something really big happens, like and this is and I'm not trying to diminish anybody that lost a loved one or to diminish the significance of this disease, the 200 plus the thousand people that died in this country. But compared to a supervolcano, compared to a solar flare or an asteroid impact or an entire state on fire.  Well, that well, that's. California, two states now Colorado, California, lost more than a million acres. Yeah. Oh, so you had all those things up and they start to really look like something little pieces. Yeah. So remember how to grow it. So I'm saying yes, remember how to grow shit would be very nice.  And don't go to a place where it doesn't rain. Yeah. Things light on fire. A place where it doesn't rain. Yeah. Does it rain out.  And Jarome, it hasn't rained for a long time but we had so much snow two years ago and this last year that the, the snowpack actually fed the, the water, the groundwater. So Jerome has a decent amount of water this year. It hasn't rained. So that's distressing. Do you get all your stuff with water?  Yeah, it's around Spring Mountain Spring. So we are guys. Yeah. So we and it's all the stuff that's gathered from the snowpack that's coming down through the rocks.  And now what, during this whole pandemic. What about your Osteria and like it did. OK, we just we did everything, you know, whatever the rules were, we went above and beyond the rules, but we made sure we were providing food, that we were making sure that we had stuff to serve you and making sure that people got fed. What were the rules out there?  Because it's not it was we were completely shut down for like six weeks, seven weeks. And then they said, OK, if you're if you're serving if you're serving food, you have alcohol and you're serving food, you can sell the bottles to go. You can serve food to go. So we did that, set the table up, did that. And as soon as I said, OK, you can be at 50 percent occupancy. OK, great.  So you set, you know, separate the tables out and let people come in, you know, where your mask on your way to the bathroom. Just be cool. Just be cool. Yeah. And we did OK. I mean, we're not you know, we're definitely down from last year, but there's restaurants. There's I mean, the restaurant industry is fucking hammered, you know, if you're keeping up on that.  Oh, believe me, I've had it's Adam Perry Lang in and Janice Green. Yeah.  And she got Bobby Stucky in here.  Who's Bobby? Bobby Stucky from Fosca Food and Wine in Boulder, Colorado. OK, he's he's one of the I've see him out there championing, like trying to get this funding for the for the small restaurants.  These people that have these amazing restaurants. I was telling you about, Felix Felix is in Venice. They're very lucky that they have this outside area they can set up there. And it's they're very fortunate they have that kind of space.  Yeah, but so many people do not. Yeah. And they're in L.A. just won't let them open. But I won't let them open in half capacity. They won't let them open.  Well, you can't survive. It had capacity in most restaurants are operating at a ten percent margin if they're doing great.  Janet was explaining that when she was in here.  That's a that's a it's not it's not what you think it's like. Right. The thing that blows my mind, though, jumping, you know, several hats here is watching people go, oh, I'm just going to get my I'm going to get my relief money and hang out. Hey, you want a job? We have this job. We need to do what? There's this job that continues to need to be done even when all the shit's going on.  I mean, we're still digging holes. We're still pulling. I get my check, then I won't get my check. OK, so let's just be clear. So you don't want to do help me do the job.  You want to get your money. Okay, it's not a lot of money and it's not going to be forever, but I'm going to figure out a way to do this job without you. And then when you come looking for the job and the money runs out, I'm going to say, fuck you eat a dick bag of salty dicks or sweet, sweet, salty, whichever you choose.  So is your salty bag of dicks for you because we figured out how to do without you.  We needed you. We needed you. And then you didn't want to do it. No amount of money is going to patch this up like it's where there's a thing we're actually doing. We have to tend the vines. We have to tend the greenhouse. There's things we have to do to get there.  So you're talking about specific instances inside of your commune?  Oh, yeah, OK, I'm not I'm talking about in Los Angeles or in a big city, you get that sort of diffusion of responsibility thing with. Oh, yes, so many people and there's a lot of people that are just rather take that check.  Just take what? You're getting that out of employees.  Yeah, well, used to be. Yeah, yeah. We found a way around you.  But it's funny how some people will be angry at you for that.  They'll say, well why should they risk their lives to work. Yeah, why should you? Well. Do you if you are going to do this with your employees, do you give them precautions on how to protect themselves?  Absolutely we do. The our employees are our first. And, you know, first and foremost, our employees are the first consideration, keeping them safe. So any any policies, if I have to take the hit for the policy, I'll take the hit for the policy because I'm protecting the employees.  Have you thought about providing them with vitamins and zinc and that kind of thing? We just, you know, we put them in rubber suits. Who's kidding? I got the devil masks with. No, just you just you just have policies in place and you arm them with the authority to have a person not be able to be in your store if they're not going to respect the constant interaction that that employee has to go through all day long.  It's the same thing as in a plane like that.  That flight attendant had just breathe your cigarette smoke for years. And do all of them die of cancer?  No. Did some of them get cancer? Not all of them got cancer. Not all of them died of cancer. But they risk getting that was the argument about bars, too.  And they should be able to smoke in bars.  What about the people that have to work in those every day exposing that person to that thing? That's why you don't not because of you and not because of my clothing being stinking like cigarettes. No, it's because that person is being exposed to that every day. And the more they're exposed to it, the more they're being put at risk. That's that responsibility for your fellow human. Is this that.  But on the bright side, we have been provided with videos of these fucking non non-match protesting douche bags that just scream at Wal-Mart and scream at people about the take it away.  My right comedy is just a cornucopia of comedy is like billowing out like all year long. It's been incredible. It's amazing how many people would have to cut you off pretty soon.
