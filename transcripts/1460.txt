Well, my guest today is one of the funniest human beings on planet Earth. I love him dearly. He's a hilarious comedian. He's an awesome dude.  Please give it up for the great and powerful Donnell Rawlings girlfriend podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast by Night All Day, Joto Wolof.  So good to see you. OK, this is not the cup that people expect. This is just a week off.  Darnell has not been tested. He will be tested that podcast. I'm not worried, but you ain't got to blow it up like that. Give me a chance. Give me a chance and I'll understand.  I have it, but I have subscribed. I had my measure I have to subscribe to social distancing social decision 100 percent, but the new normal to New York, can't you move over to the new normal?  And it just had nothing to do with you, Joe.  But just I just said this and don't I'm protected, possibly protecting myself from for me. Right to you, OK? And I love you. I love you that we have a certain amount of trust factor, but this Nitish shit is kind of dead and how trustworthy you are to somebody.  What do you think this is?  Well, first of all, I think what's really important for everybody right now is to strengthen your music. First of all, can I tell you something?  You do what you like. You lost weight, maybe 20 pounds. You feel good. Thank you. Yeah.  Should we take that fucking thing?  All right. Where I know folks don't give a fuck about. No yo Wasey. You don't give a fuck about.  OK, well that's one thing is like eating well, eat healthy, take vitamins this way. Need take for sure. Vitamin C, large dose of vitamin C, vitamin D and zinc. Those are very important right now. Right.  And just for you, does it isn't zinc Afrojack. Yes, it's good for low so you can get your immune system up and get everything that's all connected to your body being healthy.  You know, the more vital, vital your body is, the more vitality you have.  But, you know, the more your everything is going to work better your hormones, your immune system, everything. So those are those are things that I recommend to everybody.  But nobody's thinking about that, Joe. Oh, you got to. That's what we said. You you have to. But nobody is thinking about that. Like everybody everybody is like so afraid Kobe to Kobe, Kobe. But I personally think that you should be more afraid of catching a cold and the flu didn't get in covid-19.  I think you should be afraid of covid-19, but you should also be afraid of catching flu. You know, those are all that's bad. That's bad.  You know, it's not good to be sick. But when you when you protect your immune system and keep your body healthy and strong, it it definitely it's like you have troops.  All right. You got to think of the virus is like an invading army when all these viruses and apparently that Lex Friedman quote, what was it?  How many different viruses are there? Hundreds of thousands that are constantly competing like he was describing it.  This genius Russian scientist that I have on the population, specifically the virus was talking to all parties in general. He seems like a world war out there of viruses.  But when I hear it and when it comes to it being a world war, I've heard that this guy wrote this twenty 320000 plus distinct viruses and mammals and a hundred million invertebrates, invertebrates and plants. There's an epic microscopic world war going on all around us and inside us. Nature's beautiful and terrifying.  And then so why is this why is this one getting the headlines case?  Because it's called it's a novel coronavirus, meaning no one has an immune system for it. No one has developed immunity. You know, when you think about other diseases like the common cold or, you know, different flus, like we've had flus, people have a certain amount of immunity to flu. You get flu shots, you can get a flu shot. It gives you an immunity to a certain amount, even even when they get the flu shot wrong, apparently, because sometimes they guess the wrong flu strain, it still has enough of what a flu is to protect you somewhat, sort of keep you from getting more.  So Corona is actually a strand of it's like the baby brother of the flu. Not really.  It's a it's a type of virus. A coronavirus is a is a is a whole category of viruses that includes the common cold. This is they call it SARS two or covid 19. And this is a new one. So the problem with this is no one knows how it gets spread. Like even back as far as January, they were thinking it didn't spread through the air.  They were thinking.  So it's not a person I know this might be some ignorant questions, but I know it's not ignorance.  Like none of us really know. It's it's we're learning. So is that the like you said, I think what people are fearful of the most if it's airborne. Yes. I mean, I don't know if that is the specific reason why they're enforcing wear masks or whatever. Yes. That is I don't know if we've got to that panic stage. I know none of the people have announced it or anything, but it hasn't it hasn't been classified as a virus that's airborne.  Like it doesn't just fly around motherfucking fly around shit all day.  Well, when a virus is airborne, what it means is like when you sneeze or you cough or you, you know, breathe on someone, there's moisture that's going through your mouth and into the air and it's spreading.  It's traveling a certain amount of distance. That's how things are airborne. It's not like they're just flying around. It's they're coming out of people and they're getting in other people.  So the average space them up, you can spit some shit is six feet before it can affect you.  There's a lot of ference. Some. I think it could be as much as 13 feet, really? Yeah, they don't know it's all guesswork. It's all guesswork. They're learning as they go along how far. But they do know it travels through the air. They definitely know that there was a really sad story about a choir that got together.  And I don't know. I don't know. They didn't say how many choir couple people died because they were all singing together.  And when you're singing together, you're raising your voice.  You're projecting so probably in the air, right. With all this stuff.  You know, I just it's just it's just a man because you like.  Everybody all you hear people say is like, I can't wait for it to get back to normal again, I can't wear people like people. And I think that people want to have enough confidence in the government of Donald Trump for Donald. I think some people are just waiting for him to say, OK, we're good, it's over. And that's not going to be the case. No, it'll never be like Charlamagne posted something. I don't.  And was it a booty picture? No, it wasn't. It wasn't. The booty picture was no dog gives them illegal. But did you go to Yosemite? You know, you can't bring that name. I really love each other. Oh, it's so beautiful. Can you do this? This was a beauty booty music, at least like you just started a fucking fight.  I, I didn't. I didn't. But he posted.  Oh, my God. And his name is Lanard Joe. OK, Charmaine is a great name. Oh yeah. But the God part is the thing I would never connect with. Oh yeah.  Yeah that's well he can get away with it somehow. Lanard even says that. But if you go to his Instagram, there's something he posted about Spanish flu y you can go to the one I posted about.  Oh that's in Spanish flu. Go ahead.  What do you think. Which one of this. No, it's is it's a photograph, I think. God damn it, Marong, I was pretty shocked about that.  What a shot to make you. And so that what not. That's the one. You know, I don't know that shot me. I know that motherfucker. Dumb yellow Richard Simmons booty lose track of what we're talking about and I promise I won't interrupted. I don't know. Just said, Joe. I know. I know. I know you guys. I'm trying my hardest not to interrupt, man, but I can't stand the booty shows. But go ahead.  I'm sorry. Go ahead.  Maybe it wasn't his I saw. I swore I did not bring. I swear I did not bring this up. Just not like you said me. Oh, no, I didn't. I would never do that. I would never do that. I only did it because he so whoever I thought it was him someone posted. Maybe he did it on Twitter. I don't know. Someone posted something that was a picture of these people that got tired of social distancing after the 1918 flu.  And they were out in the streets celebrating the end of the war. And they said that that started a resurging cases and the second wave wound up killing more people than died in the war.  You know who those people were? Young men, a lot of no, they were motherfuckers.  I was in fucked up relationships. Joe Coronado's as anything.  Yo, if Coronado is going to test the love that you have for the person that you're supposed to love. Yes. And I'm pretty sure, like, nobody wants to die. Right? Right. Definitely nobody wants to die.  Right. But sometimes they bitches that you know, what were you finding out?  If you made a mistake, you made a mistake. But you start and I hope this is not the case with people. You start weighing it. You're like, oh, fuck, man, I swear.  Well, women with men to men. Imagine being living with a guy who's fallen apart right now, fall apart in the healthways much in your life.  Just like if you're together, you're together in a house 24/7 and you know, you're you're falling apart. As far as like the way you're handling this, like some people just can just accept, OK, this is a new normal.  This is what people from others open the fucking government. There's people that are freaking out. Right. And there's people that have points and there's people that don't have points. But men and women like everybody is a mess.  But, you know, you're absolutely right. And this is and I know you have got it. You're a fan of David. You love him. David and David Goblin's. Oh, love him. You understand? Like the I like I agree with you. Like, you have different mindsets from something like this happens. Yeah. You have the mindset of like, oh fuck, what am I going to do.  I'm not going to get money fuck home my right. I only could survive for one week. Somebody please help me. You got that motherfucker. The bitch motherfucker. Did you got a motherfucking this calm and says, OK, there will be some challenges. I'm not I'm not sure where the next money will come from, but I can't just sit there and bitch about. I got to do something about it. You got to do something like you say.  And one of the things that this is going to what's going to happen with this? It's going to be it's going to increase awareness on so many fucking levels because they do these covid fucking briefs every day. Right. And it's three things. They say it's going to really fuck you up if you do drugs, alcohol, and it's another one, drug obesity, obesity, drugs and alcohol.  They said obesity was the number one factor in New York City.  And this is just what you this is what they don't report. And I'm not I'm not shitting on anybody. You know, the guy I mean, hopefully nobody I know gets it. I just I don't know what should happen anyway. But this is what they don't mention when they see these numbers, you know, and it's crazy. HRB asshole of five hundred people die today. They don't break it down. Is it five hundred Joe Rogan niggas. Is it five hundred David Goggins niggas.  No it's probably it's you know what it is. It is but some. Times, it's not that's what's scary, but I know sometimes it's not, but we do know, Joe, that it contributes. Yes, it has a major factor. It's a major factor.  And people need to know that it's a major factor and stop saving their feelings, just letting them know as a fact. Yeah. So Motherfuckers is dying Chekov's. Yes. And sometimes like when you're just talking shit about in that show, this Nicole was alive with a ventilator. Right. You sound like Biggie Smalls. He was like some legendary serious nigga.  Yes. It's serious. You know what else is serious to those 10 pieces of chicken, that extra sweet tea, that motherfucking potato salad with mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise and mayonnaise, all that shit is putting. All of it is relevant of its relevance.  All of it is fucking relevant. It's delicious food. But you know what you're doing when you're eating it.  When I talk to you, drink something that's like, you know, while you're drinking it, like if you drink it like a regular Coca-Cola, it's goddamn delicious.  But, you know, you're going to pay for and know what you're doing, though. It's like from all filters, you can pay me now or you can pay me later. That's one of my shop. Did you tell her tell me that all the time like I was a fuck up in school. Right. And he'd be like, Dunnill, I'll be fucked if you like. Donio My lessons are like family filters. You could pay me now or you can pay me later.  I was young and dumb. When you're young and dumb, you don't know what wisdom is. You like this old motherfucker need to shut the fuck up. I didn't know what he meant to let those lessons he tried to teach me. Then as I got older, I was like, Now I know what the fuck he's talking about. You could pay me two dollars for this air filter now or three thousand for a whole new transmission. Right. You know, and people don't people don't.  People don't understand it. That's a way of looking at it for sure.  But the problem with people's bodies and like what they put into them is they they get this connection in their head that this is rewarding them, that food is rewarding.  That's sugar. Yeah, right. Sugar. It's a trap. It's sugar and it's carbohydrate we've been for so long.  Well, no, no more to you black people.  You go to any black person house, you want to have sugar in the cabinet. Insult, right.  You go to a white person house, you have oregano, you have time, you have rosemary is like, where the fuck is the sugars? Where's the salt?  Will you cook, right? Yeah, I do. Do you do you big in the spices. Do you know.  Because I know my spices. But one of the things that I'm trying to do is not like Heather because I have to be a good friend of mine and she just everything is fried. Right. What I want to do and I get impressed is trying to cook cleaner. And for a black person, telling a black person to eat clean is like, oh, that's nasty.  Do you know your health work done? Do you get like blood work done to see. Yeah, I know, I know. I don't know where my McAvey shit is right now. They're going to come here. I want you God. You're like, who's going to administer? I thought, you guys, they're going to be is it going to be a nurse. Charlamagne Long, follow me.  You can't lie here. They won't let you and I and I want to know. And that's another thing that's like that's a drawback of this whole process. Like who has access to a test, you know?  I mean, like who has access to a test? There's a whole line outside. If you go there's like with a bunch of these stations they've set up all around the valley where you can pull in and they'll they'll give you a test.  So what is that? That something is that something that the government is paying for as part of your show? No, it's a good question.  Jamie, do you know? The one that came before you need like a doctor's prescription, but eventually they're going to have to be able to eventually it's going to have to be accessible to everyone should be free.  It should be. Look, if we're going to spend money on anything, we should spend money on that. God damn.  The idea that you're going to make people pay for that. Yeah, you can't. This is a thing that's happening right now. It's almost like that. There's a lot of dangerous shit that happens when things go into chaos because there's people that take advantage of those moments and then you have rich people get rich.  But more importantly, laws get passed because people are scared.  And those laws can like be they could sneak something in where they ban encryption or they sneak something in where they stop digital currencies that aren't controlled by certain certain companies. They can sneak weird shit in while people are freaking out 24 hour surveillance because we want to make sure that people don't loot and riot. Weird shit can happen that can erode your civil liberties when things get chaotic, different change.  This is a weird time, you know, but this is where we live. This is life right now. You just got to.  So you think something like this had to happen for people to put real family values. And what's important in perspective, do you believe, like we talked about it off like and I'm like I'm a religious person to the extent that I know that it's something that makes people feel good about. Yeah. You know, but, you know. But then you have those holy, holy, holy people that celebrate God on one level. But then when something like this happens, they don't understand that if you believe that God can fix anything, it's going to take you to the promised land.  You've got to believe that he had to be part of the narrative of this of this curse.  How much responsibility you put on yourself and how much responsibility, even if you believe in God, you put on that, you got to do some work yourself to like even if you believe in God, don't get so fat, you're going to die. You kind of don't know that. Don't yourself do that. Start drinking water. Just exercise. Stopped eating as much sugar you can do.  It can be done motherfuckers all the fucking time. You got to fucking help. God help him. You got to help him. You can't, you can't just be like oh shit god I hope I don't get diabetes. Let me get the cotton candy. Let me get the extra sweet tea. Let me get the funnel cake. You can't do that.  Right. You're right. You can't shouldn't. If you do, you're you're doing a disservice to the gift of life.  You know, many people out there in wheelchairs, they're born with horrible, debilitating diseases. They can't do shit. People that have been in accidents, people that have been blown up in war, they can't even move around. And here you are taking a perfectly good body and just dumping bullshit into it while it just explodes.  And I understand that people get addicted to things.  You get addicted to that feeling of the rush of eating, but you've got to get yourself off of it. You know, it's got a way to live your life better. It can be done. Other people have done it. You can do it, too. The idea that you can't do it is stupid.  You know, you just gave me a thought. And the reason why I sometimes I interrupt because I know I got it right and I don't get my thoughts in that second. I'll fucking forget it, but I get it. And I'm just as sensitive to interrupting now after the result.  No, I'm not sensitive to your fucking fans because of negative nasty to me. Oh no, no, no, no, no. Not in a bad way. But people have you. They love me. But I got to get on.  I, I knew you were going to be you and I, you know, I really enjoyed meeting Rizza. He's a fascinating dude. I have a lot of respect for him. And he's a genius and a really interesting guy.  But it was funny to watch. You know, the funniest thing I would say the funny thing about it and I haven't said is I was like this. I'm going to do real good people like what you can talk about. Like, I'm just gonna talk about this. I just I felt like we had so much to talk about. Right. Yeah. And I don't feel like I owe anybody an apology or anything, but I would like to give an explanation.  Please don't. You're great. You're just being you. Hey, Don.  L just don't know you, Joe. No, no, no, no. That's easy for you. The other people. Joe, Joe. Fuck you dated me. Joe, don't try to tone it down. People they didn't have that you read. Hey, you can't say they hated you. There's so many people I don't give a fuck about you. Let me. I know nobody cares about it. I already got them in the bag, bro.  Give a fuck. I love you. Fuck you. Who's an asshole?  You know, it was you can never you can never get to a zero point. You can never get to a no haters point.  It doesn't exist. It doesn't exist. I just need to break it down just a little bit. Just because you said they weren't managing. This is how you of we're a lot of them were mad. You're reading too many of the comments and you did when we left. This was this was before covid-19 when we would embrace, when I see you, a hug and a funny the irony of that interview was at the end of it, you are now.  We're feeling good about it. I love the show. I loved it. Listen, brother, I loved it like a motherfucker, said David. Gives you pause, no Charlemagne, no Charlamagne yo, you embrace me because you said I remember what you said, you said at the end of it because that's when Rizzo did the freestyle. And you said and hearing you say this means a lot. You said that might be one of the greatest outros in podcast history, 100 percent coming from a motherfucker.  That's twelve hundred plus. You just seen it. All right. And I was like you, right? And we hugged. I do remember you telling me this, too. Don't read the comments.  I'm a hard headed site. I've heard it's right to die. And I like when I'm looking at you like, what the fuck do you mean, Joe? The Street's love me, man.  I had a good run. And I don't think you have a taste of Joe. You said don't read the comment. I know this might be excessive, but I think I only read two thousand seven hundred eighty two. Oh, my God. And it was nice. It was nice. And then they started using words that only the vocabulary of a real podcast's cringe like what words do word cringe.  Oh cringe.  Just straight cringe. Like I need a little bit more information. What the fuck is your definition of cringe. That was like cringe motherfucker said. And this is the real assholes. They didn't want anybody to get to know me if they was telling people exactly where on the timeline to find the the to discuss the head, they be like, I almost fucking killed myself.  1738. OK, get a motherfucker. Get 60 minutes before we get on.  Now, I'm telling you, you can't pay attention to that. Yo, you just got to be you you're great. You're right, Joe, not Joe.  That's easy for you to say, Joe. Yo, how many years did it take you to just be you and comfortable like this? And the reason why I'm saying it when you first started, right. When you not the birth of my pockets. Because when you first started. I know as calm as your demeanor is right now and as comfortable and I may be wrong as comfortable of saying fuck them, don't worry about them. I know that could not have been your beginning.  I you had to have had you and I may be wrong. You had to like, OK, what did that person say that what do they mean by that. I don't know.  I think I have brain damage from what they hit in the head and I don't think I worry about the same things that people worry about.  Right. You're absolutely right, because that's part and that's a real possibility. Right. You know me, that might be real, right? There might be something going on there.  But it's also I saw your whole career money and I just wanted to stand up there. I was free.  OK, so you had seat. So you had a I'm not a I don't buy a lot of shit.  I know I don't go crazy. I like cars. That's my my my only addiction. Right. But I'm not. When I did something like Fear Factor and making some money, it gave me this freedom to now just not worry about ever doing that.  You always have been of that mindset. Yeah. But it reinforced it. It just things like that reinforce it like having having like a savings in the bank is nice but also doing what you want to do is nice to.  One of the things that I learned from Fear Factor is that I want to do that anymore. I don't want to do that kind of stuff anymore.  You know what? I don't want to be premature of it, but I can see my pocket as mentor, you know, but not being into it too early. But you made me feel that type of confidence in terms and in terms of controlling your own destiny, being in control of your own shit.  And this is what you want to do, because I talk to you about every time I get an idea, I hear what you think about this, a TV show. And you told me, like, I was excited about this idea and you were like the podcast.  You control it.  You don't want your you write like you're you at your best when you're just having fun being you.  And no one's going to allow you to do that. When the producers are going to get greasy, they're going to get their greasy hands on you and they're going to try to do this to get you to wear that or don't talk about this odonnell. If you could just lay back here and just there's a bunch of people directing you. You're not going to get to who you really are. Right. You got to do it by yourself.  And also you'll find out. I don't I'm trying to interview on your own show, but where did you where'd you when did you feel that?  I just knew that because I saw the interview. You did? Yeah. And and this was like I don't know if this was the birth because this is when the technology, the whole thing and you were like breaking it. It was weird for me to hear you breaking down the future of it.  Yeah. To somebody that was actually doing it. And you said you said you got to figure out this part of how do you make money off?  How do you make money off it. Yeah, but you also get to keep it the way it is. We're no one's fucking with it.  When I went to Tom Green's house, he just had these wires like this is 2007 when it wasn't like this.  And I'm like, what the fuck they going live? He was lot. And that was dial up.  Not only was it now, people had cable and they had ISDN lines.  And 2007 is like a lot a lot of people at. Cable, it wasn't the near the bandwidth that you got now, but he had all the servers and everything in his house, he had turned his house. He had this dope house in the hills, and he had turned this house into a TV studio. His living room wasn't a living room anymore. It had a desk and had monitors behind it.  And all this was like these big fat fucking cables so that we have to Canada. Yeah, he did this all on his own.  And I had actually met with the company. I met them in the Denver comedy works and talked to them a little bit about doing something similar. But I was like my thought was like, as soon as you start dealing with a company now you're now you're doing the same thing and you just don't want them online.  You're just doing it online. There's different kinds of people. And it's not it's not a value judgment, but there's different kinds of people. There's wild creative people. And then there's studio executives.  Studio executives are the people that have to look at these wild creative people and go, how do I make sure that Donald doesn't go crazy?  I'm going to put him on this show. That's why I'm not on a regular. We'll get a break. He says he gets too wild. We got to bring him. Said too much. We got to we got to keep him on the commercials have to come in seven minutes. He has to be ready to make that break. And they'll say, look, we've got numbers done now that shows when you start talking about this, people get upset and they tune off.  Right. But if you just, you know, talk about this, we're better. So we've written some talking points and they'll bring you some shit. Look, we're not writing for you.  We're just giving you some, like, way with his desk when I do need the money.  And then you have to have a meeting and Debbie's going to pull me into the office and go down. And I just don't think you respect me. OK, we have to work together. I'm your executive producer. You know, I'm here to put this show together. You have to work with me.  And I don't want to I would love to work with you, but I don't want to because you don't respect the fact that I that you don't respect what I'm doing. So how the fuck do you get to the wild creative people?  It doesn't always work out. Like sometimes they don't it doesn't pan out. A podcast doesn't power a TV show doesn't pan out, but at least they have a chance.  Right? Like you can't have a podcast like yours.  Yours is a perfect example. You're just you you just a lot of it is just you ranting into the camera about shit.  You can't no one would ever let you do it that way and let us build an organic why.  And that's why when you were trying to tell me the beauty of it, I was understanding another reason I wanted to. I was like, all right, motherfucker, when do the money kick in? You don't feel like I understood. You was like, yeah, Daniel is going to be one. I was like this. All right, what number do I hit when I start?  Genuinely, they they say it's like when you start getting I think it's like one hundred thousand downloads. Right. That's when advertisers become interested in you because that's legitimate. That's a hundred thousand people. And as long as you pick your products carefully, I definitely did.  Good man. Right now I'm cum Dick Peel's mine was the fleshlight was the first one last night. Fleshlight. What's the fleshlight. The Fleshlight is a fake pussy that comes. It looks like it's still in business to be honest, done here on the show. I know you're not to pay me for that one right now. Let's do some fucking business. I'll do some business with you. I bet if they still do podcasts, do they do any more?  Well, that's how I met my friend Aubrey when we started on it together. He was he was running this rubber pussy business.  Know, you got to get it. I would tell you. Korona have you want to sell anything? Because I can tell you and I agree with you, I said and I was like I wasn't concerned. I wasn't thinking about when am I going to make the money to buy podcast? First thing I'm thinking about cannot do a good podcast. You told me the most important thing is the consistency of it. Yeah, you've got to get the reps in, you know, motherfucker, you got a good podcast and don't come out.  Got to make people look forward to it.  So if you do it every week, once a week, twice a week, whatever you doing, then people like us. A bunch of podcasts that I subscribe to that I like, they come out on Monday. I look forward to Monday. Right. I look forward to checking my phone. I got a new episode. You know, I'm I'm in it as a fan as much as I'm in it as someone who does it. Yeah.  I mean, you you've pushed me on, you talk shit and you didn't people think you inspired me. You was talking shit to me and I was trying to motivate you. I knew it. I was like, man, if I see this too good, I was like, if I see this motherfucker one time at a comedy store and he cracks this motherfucking neck and look me in my face and say, What the fuck are you doing? All right, I like this.  I had that shut up. But going into it. But I knew I was right. I knew I was I don't know what the fuck do. I was scared, son.  I know.  But look, it worked and worked and I was scared this movie. But, you know, and I feel you you can have your own man. That's my son's hair right there. So that's why I it just speaking to that show.  So everybody, your mask though, the mask. Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. This is a Donora Road show at Metastasise for y'all motherfuckers.  Now, this is the what does it say on it. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. What does it say. It says it says hold on. It says the Donaire Rollins show on one. What is that, what's up, right? The other side of Danny rolling the other side says not today, not today, Ron, it won't happen today.  And if you see your looks all right, I'm going to tell you I see some job and tell you I would tell you what I have is this is a tough time for everybody. Nobody will take their hat off. Right. And you'll be feeling right. And I was I will never get to Hollywood again if I do this right. So I start going. You'll see. I mean, I see the bears.  I got the motherfucking sunroof, dude. I got a sunroof. No, I got a sunroof. Sunroof. This man's a sunroof, yo. But your sunroof make it to me last year. This is not the same roof. You know, I've said this is this is a hoodie roof right here. So I cut my size here. Right. And I was like, oh, shit, what can I do? Right. He saw us there.  He was like, oh. So I said, I'm going to fuck around. I take you to the show and I'm going to get a glue stick and put it on my head just for fun. He thought it would be funny. And I showed him this podcast the other day and he got excited about it. But the thing I like about me having to hit it smells like him. So it's like a souvenir.  And right there, you know what, Joe? I don't want to feel like I'm CVS's or anything right now, but I want to say we all know when it comes to Korona, there's certain things that go before, you know, if you have Carone or you kind of feel it. Right, your sense of smell and your test, that's why you're not going to believe this. Right? I came up I came up with a one of a kind.  This is specific to me. It's the Daniel Rawlings show. OK, now, I'm not I don't know if you familiar with a smell called black ice black.  Do know a black. I know you know a black. I don't know. I wouldn't lie to you. No, you don't really know what the air freshener is. I don't think so. Do you know what it is?  You don't know? OK, you're going to I bet know. I mean, I've you know. OK. It's like a car. All right. You know this one. You know the Royal Pine Air freshener. Yeah. Those little white one.  Yes. You racist motherfucker. Yo, yo, is there another color? So, you know, let me just tell you right off the bat. Oh, my God. I'm a car freak. I hate air fresheners. I don't like them. I want to smell car. I want to say that about I want to smell gasoline. And your car is not about your car.  Like you've not been into a Cadillac, a black a black owned Cadillac. You've never had a ride with Snoop Dogg or any of the hip hop dudes right now in the culture, black culture, black, it's just the smell.  You always have to have it in your car.  If you want to get some pussy back in the day, you don't have to smell right.  Yo, yo, yo, yo, I'm not go. So there it is. Oh, my God. It's a tree, though. Yeah, it's a tree. It's the same shit. It's the same thing as a white man's air freshener. The thing is, it's the same shape. It's the black lives matter of air fresheners.  It is hilarious, though, they pretend, look, it's like a tree made out of chemicals. But Joe. Oh, it's like the woods, Joe.  I don't want to distract, but getting back to the candle, this is the dangerous candle. Right. And I want to handle. Yeah, that's all right. Checking up on one of my Whitney when it comes. Has one. Angela, you have one. They'll check it out. Tell me what you think. Oh, that smells good. I'm Jamie. So you know what, let me smell it. See, that's another thing. This is a this this candle helps you don't KORONA like you burn that count in a minute.  You don't smell it.  Go the test. But more important, Joe, more importantly, Joe, it's could you read the description? Could you read a description of the ingredients in it, the ship back here? Yes, sir. Got to get my get your glasses, man. Have on the screen if you can.  Oh, yeah. Much better. Right.  Go from Marcy Projects to Hollywood. Donelle captured six true smells, oils going from ashy to classy breathe in the memories of cold air hitting your skin on a winter's day. Shades of your skin getting angrier and angrier as the brisk wind hit your arms and ankles captured the energy of a good lotion without having it. Black ash eliminates the smell of talk and replaces it with exotic smells. The ingredients, Joe?  I don't know the first one. What does that bergamot. Bergamot. I don't know what that is. You know what that is, Jim? Bergamot. We sandalwood. I've heard of that musk. Oh, Elon lavender.  Jasmine and amber gamba grass.  Ambergris, amber ambergris. Amber. Do you know what that is. And this OK, Amber, because this is where because I have a really special person who does these cans. Right. Ambiguous. And I was talking to somebody who is really into real stuff. And this was I heard ambiguous was at first it was sperm from a whale.  I knew you would get excited about this. You would have thought about it. This is what I heard. First, it was sperm from a whale that they mined for. Right. But come to find out, it wasn't I thought it was I was like, oh, shit, my candle got a whale. Not right. But it's not the it's the byproduct of actual sperm whale.  Do you know when the. But no politics, no criminal cruelty.  That's the load out of the whale without being caught.  That's when the story started to start. That's where the story got flaky. You know, I mean, I needed to know more. I was like, who was jerking the West?  Sixty thousand, which you fucking pop up ads, you son of a bitch.  What is it? Email thing? Oh, you have to give them an email. Oh, shut up.  I know you got somewhere on a boat. I was going to say, is that Red Bull? We found out the Red Bulls made with taurine and the original source of taurine.  They should get it from bull testicles. Really? Bull nuts. Yeah, like Hitler apparently was into taurine nuts. Yeah. It's like some form of testosterone or something or some form of stimulant.  Well, anything that has something to do with sperm, it feels like it's supposed to give you super, super strength with something.  People are silly ambergris. How to tell if you struck gold with the whale vomit or stumbled upon sewage.  Oh, so sometimes they find it like floating around.  Yeah. Oh is it. Oh no, no. The first thought I thought it was sperm so I was like, who the fuck is swimming through.  Oh my God, look at that shit. It, it can be up to seventy one thousand dollars for a one point five seven kg lump. That's like three, three and a half pounds. Right. And it's a lot saliva.  What is the. Well what is it the. Well it said whale vomit. So it's like yes, look, I know it, I know it's compared to fucking truffles.  Oh my shit. My candu got truffle ish type fucking ambergris.  It's a product of the sperm whale. That's what it is. Scroll back up a little bit. There is no cruelty. Nobody beat the shit out of the whale.  It's not whale sperm. It's a product of the sperm whale. That's not only a sperm whale makes the compound responsible for ambergris allure.  It's called embryo and different organisms, bio different compounds such as caffeine, maybe cocoa, coffee or tea plants. And Brene is made by sperm whales only to glue together squid beaks.  What the fuck would you sand now, Joe is my can do is Ballah is shit man. Look at this and the rest of it.  Listen, of squid is the main diet of sperm whales, but the beaks can't be digested. They need to be passed out without causing injury. They do this by coating them with Ambron. So the sperm whale creates this amazing shit just to dissolve beaks of squids.  Got a fucking candle, God damn natures and to be in my fucking Kambah and just say on my black ass sea. But the thing is, it's some quality shit in there, Joe. And the thing about it was it what I was going to launch this before the Corona's shit hit, but I had to ask myself like this with put things in perspective for me.  I'm a Rolet, you know, I'm a road dog.  Yeah, well, you a road dog, you start feeling like you look at your Kandal comedian, you look at your calendar and see your county you like. I'm good. And the rhythm of my calendar. Before this part I was rocking with Martin. We had fucking dates coming all you know, I'm saying I had some. So I'm looking for some New Orleans. Nashville, Orleans. I know what I'm supposed to do, knew this was going to be my weekend.  It was you and Dave on a Friday and then Martin Lawrence the next day. As I say, in the streets, God was good as a motherfucker. The last show I did before these mandates came in, it was at what you probably played play Milwaukee. Did you have in the past year or so, you've been down in the green room downstairs, right? Incredible. That was the last time. The last time I was on stage, you remember one weekend I was 14th.  Or was it the weekend before that?  It was like a couple of weekends where people are still like a member post. Malone had a big show.  It was it was a band. It was like, you know, the reason why because see, the road guy, whatever, every like when we were on the road every day was a different news report. You don't saying it was right when it was going down, just like it was like with everybody reading. Yeah, it was everybody was like, oh fucking this one was here, the NBA baseball. And we was like, this week. Good.  We tell a jokes about it.  The next thing you know the shit. Yeah. Was shut down. But I said I was like, hold up motherfucker. You are really. Unemployed right now. You know, and when I say that my flow of income is wrote and I'm like, what do you do? You got savings and shit, but you still nobody wants to just see money going out and no money coming in. And then I was like, I was happy there. This is why I always thank you.  But I was happy because you got me out the gate. So the momentum is there and I needed to put the focus and I was forced to put the focus on it. But I put the focus on and I say to myself, as all these comedians, bitch, what am I going to do? I'm like, you got three months to figure out what your rhythm is going to be and what you're going to do.  You can wait for this year, what ever you consider to be over. You can wait for it's over and then, like, start now or you can start now and always on like that. He can't or think it was going to be a novelty thing or whatever. But I was like, this candle is going to want to train me on what it takes to come up with an idea market and get people excited about it, provide a quality product and see what the feedback is, you know.  So I know it may seem like so simple to people, but as I've always had an entrepreneurial spirit but never was forced to really engage it.  Yeah, well, you know, you only have so much time, right?  That's it. We're doing stand up counseling. You're always on the road. There's only so much time to do other things. And the worry is that if you do try to do other things, that those things will take time away from your stand up. That's what every comic worries.  But I'm I was a road rat. Yeah. So I talked to you before. It starts. Somebody said every time I do interview first thing people I must be because we're on a stage. You and I are we do this shit. You know, I'm saying we don't just OK, I got an arena tour coming up. All right. I'm going to take two weeks.  I'm terrified that I'm going to tape and look, I'm going to tape an hour special. I got one week to prepare for it. And you see it. It's reflective of the show. You can do not that people know. We straight up Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. You know, you probably not.  So you you do clubs anymore? I do. All the clubs that do go out and hit like.  Yeah, I still do. I like to, I like to do comedy works in Denver.  So you know what those reps, those reps are, that's what that down you like for that person. It's just like everything we express and part of it, we do it because it's somewhat about therapy. You know, I'm saying you're angry or something. Let me go fucking talk about it. Are you happy about some.  Let me go fucking talk about it, you know, like so people like that when it's time when it's when it's time to put up you you fucking ready to do it. You I mean you're working out. Yeah.  You have to. It's just this we've all tried stand up different ways. You know, there's been comedians since the beginning of stand up trying at different ways and pretty much everybody agrees you've got to do it constantly and and I always lose my tone this way.  I start to interrupt.  But the question that I had to bring my back and I'm learning to be better at this is people always act on these interviews. They say, oh, and I was this was a follow up on us, how we love performing. They say, oh, man, it's got to be fucking killing you to not be able to get on stage. And if. If I didn't have my son like the thing now is I'm replacing stage time with dad time and it doesn't affect me as much, you know, I'm saying it doesn't.  Oh, I got to get out because this time I was like, OK, I got to do three spots. Tonight, I'm watching on with my son. I'm building a goddamn fucking a fake candy machine out of cardboard. So it's the transition for me hasn't been that tough because I just put that energy somewhere else and it's been amazing. My son's four years old, Joe. This is the longest stretch of time I've spent with him since he was born.  Not because I'm a neglectful dad or anything, because you got shows. And it put things in perspective, because at one point when I was like, I can't miss this show, you got to go get the money, got to get money. Now that I'm getting this town, my son going back out or whatever, I'm glad this you know what? Maybe I just should start considering canceling that weekend, you know, could do things around here, too.  That's what I'm doing.  I've been thinking a lot about that, about almost like doing like an L.A. residency, like find a place that's like a 500 seat theater or something.  But this is what this is. This is the beauty of curvy. If there's anything, it makes you think on a different level.  What makes you think that this is really temporary? Just because it's always been there doesn't mean it will always be there.  What you mean or just whatever life is right way, the way our society is structured, this is new, right? There's the cities themselves are new development. They've only been around here for a few hundred years. Right.  We all my friends think we the world started in the 60s because whatever it is, whatever the date is, we all know that the world used to be very different. We just assumed that the way it is now is the way it's going to stay. That's not a good assumption because it's all volatile and it changes constantly. And there's natural disasters that are way scarier than this virus. That's things like asteroid impacts that are inevitable. There's things like super volcanoes which are inevitable.  They're going to happen whether they happen 100000 years from now or 100 days from now. Somewhere in the world, a giant volcano is going to explode and it's going to turn the whole fucking planet to nuclear winter. And a lot of shit is going to die. It's going to cloud out. The sun is going to cool the temperature of the planet and it's going to do it for years. And a lot of fucking things are going to die. That's happened a ton of times that I mean, this what we're having right now is people are conditioned to because they went through it.  We never went through it. Exactly. But this is why we're going through something that is good.  If there's anything that's good about going through something is that you're forced to realize that something can happen, something real can happen that shuts the world's economy down. And no one saw it coming. Something real. That's a real thing.  But we really haven't had an America. We really haven't had that test. No, but this is for the whole world, though. This is like a planetary test. And the good thing about that is you get to see how different people try it. Different people have different, you know, strategies. They have to deal with their public and their health care. And it's very different results all over the planet. They're going to analyze all that shit and try to find out why Germany did so well and Italy did so bad and this and that they're going to try to put all this stuff together.  It's it's a it's a terrible time for the people that are affecting the people that get sick. But it's no, there's not a good thing, do you think?  But people can get something good out of it when you get something good out of a bad thing. And the good thing is to prepare yourself better.  You know, I agree with you on two percent. But do you think it's because when you talk about, you know, only my father would know there were no more than ten viruses. Most mothers I grew up with only know one virus. You know you know all the viruses. Do you think? And when they know all the virus, you know, you just know there no meat. You know, I barely know what I'm talking about. Yeah, but it sounds good.  But you read off the ten syllable words like, you know, all the motherfucking viruses, but you really have to clap it out.  But they say this is what they say about the virus. Do this what they say about the virus. Dugal they say it's a bit less virus. Yeah. Like they like is it for some people. For some people do you think. And I've heard that. Will you think it'll be flattening more or when it starts getting really, really hot do you think I heard it doesn't survive like eighty five degree or ninety degree temperature.  This is what I read somewhere that it doesn't that the likely hood of a living out of your body, whatever is a lot shorter.  Yeah, I don't know if that's true, but I do know that for whatever reason there are seasons. Right, people get colds.  I mean it kind of makes sense that. Yeah. Because wouldn't be on surfaces as long like that.  That's why you have somebody to have a cold in the summer you like. Whoa, yeah. You're OK because those viruses don't flu viruses coronavirus. That's like some cold shit. Yeah.  I don't know enough to comment on that, but I do know that they're worried that's going to be a second wave. The world is going to be first wave and then people are going to relax and there's going to be a second wave.  The second wave of people have to if people build too much confidence, it's definitely going to be a second wave.  What's weird to me is how some people get it.  And it's nothing. They don't even they they just had a call for a couple of days.  I can't believe I had that person close to mine that works in my camp. I won't say his name or whatever. Right. Preschool's this motherfucker had Corona Light.  Yo, I know I had to be true.  This motherfucker said I talked to her. I heard he had grown. I was like, oh, Garralda, I was all fucked up, right? I was like, oh shit.  Like all this shit. Right. And then motherfucker say he was home like three days later. I'm like, what fucking type of Korona you got.  So is it the hospital for three days. Yeah, it was a hospital. Listen, if you're in the hospital for three days, I mean you got it bad.  Michael, Michael fucking Michael yo. Michael Yo in a. Weird thing about the Michael Yo joint, because, like, I love Michael, I him, he's such a great deal.  He's a great guy. He's a great guy. So I was up early every morning for four thirty. I'm up early. Right. And some people are up like five o'clock hit. I posted something in yo like it which is OK, normal of him. And then he commented, I was like, oh motherfucker, you up. Right. I'm like, you want to comment you up. You could, you could like in your sleep. Right.  Right to comment. You could just automatically call how many I oh this motherfucker like blah blah blah. Comment is like OK put the glasses on. Right. So this is when I was up the notion I was like motherfuckers. The shit is so fucked up by this pandemic is that motherfuckers are afraid to die. And then I said and this this was my mind.  And I was like, only time motherfuckers really thing about living is when they think they're going to die. That's when when someone with a doctor says, well, how long you have to live? Three years. I'm going to do everything. They want to see their parents more. They want to fuck, do they bucket list shit. You know, I'm saying I was like, this is motherfuckers. They afraid to die. You got to know that it's inevitable.  That's going to happen to everybody, you know? So I was just I just want to rap when yo. So I told him, I said man and I told him his whole shout it man motherfucking trying to live and to a motherfucker is I'm thinking about dying. It said Michael yo say nigga almost died right at that moment was so meant so much to me for so many reasons.  Joe, to hear Michael Yo say the word nigga say that I got to say is way Brady said his Wayne Brady had to smack. Of course I was I my nigga. Finally, I was so happy.  I was so happy because Michael Yo was one of the most unscathed motherfuckers. You know, this mother, it's me. Like Michael Yo names should have been Preston or something like that. Right. And then he told me what his situation was, whatever. And he's getting better. And he had Nasta or whatever, but he got it bad.  He got out, he was in the hospital and he legitimately told me he thought he was dead.  To my point, as much as we want to consider it, that's all we hear. The death of it. Yeah. So die in twenty four hours. But this is about Michael Yo.  You have to really consider is that he's healthy. He's young. Exactly. He's robust like he's a guy. Works out a lot just like when you hear that he got it and almost died like oh well this is a different thing.  I'm thinking we're talking so much about fried chicken. Do not yo yo, don't let him do his job. No health. Health that like that guy just said, Michael Yo, get off. You get in touch with your black side or your Asian side, which which side, Michael, you have grown in the black side him, he's thin and he works out a lot like he's not he is not overweight at all.  And he lifts weights a lot. We got about on the podcast. He goes to this like weightlifting gym.  I know that place he goes to.  It's like some it's just all weightlifting and classes.  And he's a healthy guy. And that's why when I say the point I'm making is like, you know, it's not like this may sound crazy. Like when you back in the day when you heard about AIDS, you didn't hear when it first popped. Nobody survived it through. Nobody. It was like, you get AIDS, nigga for months.  It's a rap. And everybody thought they had it and everybody thought they had. But the reason why and it took some time for it doesn't have a cure.  But people living with it, people. When did you get tested? When did you get tested? About four years ago.  The first time you get tested for the first time, the first time was like I got tested for an insurance thing that I had to do for health insurance, like 92, 90, some 92 tuition.  I was so terrified. Yeah, just a slideshow. Korona Terrible decisions. I've made the Coranderrk.  But the point I was making. But when that first when that first hit, when that first hit motherfuckers was like it was like people didn't really take it as serious because they just thought it was just associated with a certain lifestyle. Well, you know, originally we thought anybody could get it.  That's what they were really worried. They're worried that I mean, this was remember, when did they even start calling it HIV?  Like, in the beginning, they were just calling it AIDS. Right. People were worried about. And, you know, I think before that, they'd even call it the gay cancer, like they were trying to figure out what it was.  It was killing people. But when I took my first test in 92, I remember all my friends were going through a similar situation and everybody was terrified to take the test because we were all convinced that it had some incubation period. You could have it in your body and you'd be fine for five years, six years and boom, and it would kick in.  But a point is the point I'm making about that is the like.  But like you hearing you hear these stories of people like Michael Yo, you heard a story about the person I was talking about earlier.  You hear people that when you heard they got it, whatever, that they made it through, people are surviving it. You know, some people. Yeah, some people. Yeah.  Yeah. But that's what's weird about it, man. It's killing some people that are young. And apparently there's something called that I never took any consideration called viral load.  And this is a form of sperm will never do it. Well, how does that exactly define viral load? So it's like someone who works as a nurse in an E.R. who deals with a lot of these patients is much more likely to get it than someone just gets in contact with one person who has it.  That's the concern being around. Yeah, the low.  I mean, these these poor people that are working in health care right now, they're dealing with this constant environment of sickness and a lot of young nurses.  Yeah, that's the that's the young doctors that is so fucked up. And it's so sad because you like you know, we have the shortage of these masks and everybody's doing masks and stuff. And one of my friends is like, I need a mask. I was like, you better get a scarf, do something right. It was like, no, I need to m 94 three. So and so. I'm like, if you're walking if you walk down the street with one of those fucking surgical doctors masks to go to the fucking store, you should feel ashamed yourself because the doctors and nurses are the people that need that stash.  The people are out there on the front line are the ones that need that stare. That's true.  But in California, you have to wear those. Now, in L.A., you have to wear those when you're out. Yeah, you have to.  I'm talking about the level like the one I'm talking about is the one that. You mean that the real filter. The real filter.  And I know that they like at first it was all about everybody was like of the notion you got to have this certain mess. But then he said, you know, you have to cover yourself, have to do it. They won't even let you into certain spots. But because of it. Yeah, yeah.  No, there's a new law in Los Angeles. In Los Angeles, when you're out, you have to have your face covered, which is a wonderful man.  That is is that just is that just for going into business is just a precedent to set?  Because now people in the future, like, when are you going to tell them they can't cover their face anymore?  This is where it gets weird because before they never want to say that they'll see before.  It was weird if you saw someone with their face covered, you would get nervous when they were trying to rob you if they weren't Asian.  Imagine if you were a guy who works at a 24 hour convenience store and everybody's got a face mask. You know how much that guy's his tension has spiked. Your anxiety has spiked. Everyone could potentially rob, you're not going to be a late night shift. You're not going to be. That's why I got to see through mask.  No down a motherfucker. You want to get back to really racial profiling. All right. But you're right. That has to be. People work in a liquor store and yell like you're you're you're like a star has been robbed a couple of times already.  First off, if I were this here's a liquor store. Anybody think about. Rob likes to keep in mind that I'm almost certain that every motherfucker to own a liquor store got a shotgun or pistol back there. Yeah, I don't give a fuck. They're going to have something back. So I could roll up in here with your fucking Spiderman mask if you want to. You won't get your head split. That's a crazy job to be in, man.  Put yourself in a situation where every day you go to work, you might have a gun stuck in your face and be told to empty out the cash register any day like you live in fear that the people coming in might rob you.  I said I was that I have a routine. I don't socialize. I go and get coffee. Right. A 7-Eleven I go to and I'm.  I know the mafia, the Mexican mafia that I work in there, right, and I was outside a car and it was a black guy in here, I could tell him this guy was looking the black guy.  Next thing you know, I was about to do a radio interview, D.C., my manager was shot out and these motherfuckers started rumbling like fighting, like going at it, like pop, pop, pop, pop, you fuck you.  And my instinct was to try to go help or do something. And for a second I was like, oh, this is fucked up, messed up that then I was like, wrona out there, motherfucker, I'm not getting in. And they finally they stop.  But it just it was just weird, like that kind of contact.  Unless you're stopping a man from doing that to a woman or unless you're stopping someone from hurting someone as much as this motherfucker worked for 7-Eleven, Joe, like he's defending whatever might have been a can of spam or whatever the situation is.  Oh, that's why he's fighting over. I don't know what it was. I don't know what it was. I'm pretty sure you accused Guy of shoplifting, but he put his especially in this day and age, whatever, and in a state. Well, this motherfucker was fighting he was fighting for this shit to let it go.  Yeah, you got to let it go.  I'm like this motherfucker you can have, especially because you're just an employee. Imagine having to fight for a can of spam, but that's getting paid five dollars an hour anyway. And minimum wage. What's what's minimum? It's like, no, no, no, it's over seven zero Idil.  They're trying to make it fifteen. I don't even know anybody that's making minimum wage. I know a few people. I bet it's like eleven dollars. I think it's like eleven or twelve bucks.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Imagine fighting someone for eleven or twelve bucks an hour. They will fight to the death of a Mexican.  They will. Yeah. You can start a new league. Yeah. You have a Home Depot. It may match so let them do the fight Marzook free. They don't give a fuck. That's allare. Yeah but I was just like this cottan.  What what are you loyal to this company or are you loyal to the fact that you're in there protecting this Seven-Eleven goods because you providing money for your family?  But I said I said he doesn't even have a fucking security guard like the guy behind the counters got to go. And it was just it was it's it was one dude. One do. No, no. He couldn't they couldn't jump anything. Was one fucking. Do you imagine being that dude.  It's in the sketchy area with the late nights, the late night shift and just sitting there looking out the window, looking at all these people, you're in there like a little target.  I'm telling you, I would be more fearful of that dude in that situation every day. The demand for it is coming in there. Yeah, because he you know, he's played that scenario on his head forever.  Probably has to come back. I'm going to don't to hit the button and everything. Yeah.  A lot of people catch people slipping all the time.  It's just those videos that you watch on YouTube and you see someone get shot or see someone get robbed, like, man, this is just a job, just a terrible job.  And you get a gun put in your face. Think about getting actually robbed that I was I used to live in Brooklyn. And Islamist area called Fort Greene, Clinton Hills, and it was right in the beginning, have been gentrified, right? Spike Lee used to have a house right down the street and I used to do a porch comedy poetry night, get a little money from the hat or whatever.  And I don't go into the weeds, but I like want to go because we have got to whisper to my folks rolled up on me and I know I was in gentrifier neighborhood because my hood sensors were down. I should have never been looking down to my folks around me. Give me a shit motherfucker like oh shit. It was like when this motherfucker said where the jewelry because I'm not a flashy type of person. Where did you get the phone at?  Motherfucker was like, I don't travel like that. I don't get down to these movies.  Are you a broke motherfucker? You calling me broke and you fucking robbing me?  I like what the fuck you some I didn't raise you right.  That makes no sense.  And I was still going to go to the cheeseburger. Let's do it a couple of bucks in my pocket. Right. But I was like it would be just my luck. I go to the whispy in the same motherfucker that robbed me is in a goddamn weird spot. Yeah. But that shit was like. People and and when it happened to me, I felt fucked up. I felt so violent because I'm like, you a bitch, I will respect you more.  If you mugged me, you're like, beat me up for my money. But to pull a gun out and have that advantage and think you tough, that shit was so fucked up and I felt so violated on the inside, I was thinking. Like, probably what most white dudes think, you know what, I'm going to jump for the gun like you, I'm thinking, why would you think I'm going to disarm them?  Because I know you got to move on somebody. I know you know something. And somebody put a gun to you, you'll be like and the next thing you know, the gun in their face.  I was thinking that shit, but I was like, if I miss people have a distorted idea what they can do, especially if a guy's got a gun, you you have a real distorted idea of how quickly you can move through space.  Like all this person has to do. Is this. That's it. That's the great equalizer. So that's what the movement like. That kid can kill you.  And that's the reason why I didn't go with how I felt. And hence, you have to, you know, give him the money.  It's just yeah, you're right. It's a it's a bitch way to do things.  But it is just a it's a part of society that most people never use. Most people never pull a gun on people to get what they want, but some people do. It's a real thing. And it's it's a it's one of the weakest things someone can do.  It is it felt and but it also well, you feel powerless, but it also can be on the other side. On the other side, it can protect you. You know, I watched a video today of these guys. They don't want to farm to other side on and places. And we talked about this for the other side were places where it's legal, like, you know, the only people that have guns for protection. And I'm speaking I live in New York.  Was the police legally?  Right. Legally, yeah. Yeah. That's where it gets real crazy, right? Like, then it's like California is the opposite. California, it's not that hard to get a gun. You know, people would think that California would be way more liberal than New York. But New York, it's very difficult to get a handgun.  You can get like a personal carry, not just for like if you know, if you're a business, you carry a certain amount of money. You can get a gun in California. You can get it just by having a clean record.  Yeah, you can get it for your home. Yeah. Nevada has really interesting. Well, excuse me, Arizona has real interest.  Motherfucker picked this up for a what time it was. Yeah. Arizona. You could have it out. Yeah. Yeah. It's an open carry state. That's the equalizer that shuts down Arizona.  Yeah. That's Arizona, right. Yeah. It's Wild West down there. I know for sure.  I've seen a guy that was I had to get out that he was not only our driver, but he was he had his shit ready like Joe Exotic.  Right. He's in Oklahoma. He's always walking around with Detmold. They have an open carry law. Yeah, that's the funniest shit ever. But it's so people connected with different personalities. And I'm watching this shit like like this motherfucker is really crazy. I was like, but he's fake.  He was the probably the originator of trolling. He was a marketing, if you think about it. Yeah. He was a marketing genius. Every time you thought you had him, he knew how to flip it. But then he got like what most trolls do, they go too hard. He turned into Takashi's six tonight. It's like, brah, you got enough followers, bro. Look, if you win too fucking hard, that's what it was hard.  And that lady went and got them. Yep. It didn't. I guess he was so used to trying to win that and eventually he lost by trying to win so hard while he was just kind of fucking.  Yeah, he was what. Carroll fucking basket.  Yo he was funny with that shit. So it was hilarious. It was very, very intense.  Obviously had a sick obsession with her though.  It's not like it's a it's it's cute when you watch a documentary that doesn't affect you personally.  When you watch in, you know, seven episodes of this guy shooting a Carol Baskin dummy, I don't think he had as much obsession with her as he had obsession with fame and people talking about him. And he knew that she was the right person to keep talking about, to give him the fame he wanted.  I believe he he knew his boys, everybody around him. That ain't going to give me a headline.  I think it was also she was going after his business saying that he, like she she apparently has a different philosophy on the sanctuary.  Yeah. What she does is different. Saving them. Yeah. And she's not into the cub petting. Right. There's a whole cub petting industry, apparently.  And so that she was reporting them on that. And, you know, his argument was like, what the fuck are you doing?  Yeah, they're not they all the cages, bitch. Yeah, they're all in cages. Right. Any time you put a big cat in a cage. Right.  Doing the same thing, you treating it better in the cage. So you have a holier than thou attitude. It's crazy. You know, these things should be wild. They should be loose in the wild and there should be a few of them maybe that are if there's a worry about extinction, a few of them that are isolated somewhere. But to have it like that, it's probably brazing.  They probably had similar. They both had some of the personality traits because they gave a fuck. It didn't give a fuck. At the same time, both of them shared some of that. But her she came on a more peaceful side history.  It was the aggressive nature. He was relentless. You want my fucking what? But that shit was funny. I got to laugh.  I like watching him blow. Shit up. Well, look at him walking around with a knee brace on the guns out and the fucking permanent eyeliner, I mean, he's just he's right out of a movie.  No. When they showed a picture of him with his three husbands, I was like, this is movie worthy. They're both saying they're straight. Oh, I'm straight.  You so, you know, you can do that right now, right. Joe, you know that right now, right.  Straight guys, can you can they say this is what I've heard on the streets in certain was that this is what I'm saying. I understand that this is where some outlets. Right.  That you can suck a dick twice or three times. No, no, no, no. Three. Then you would be gay. OK, you guys suck a dick twice. So first as a test second is coming, I don't know. Second, it's like you confirm your test. It's like a double blind placebo controlled study. It is. But it's only two like the same process at the comedy club to drink minimum. Like this is what I heard in those streets.  I don't know those streets, but you could do it and got a new shit call fluid.  Oh, gender fluid. You go back and forth.  Gender fluid means like sexual orientation fluid or gender fluid would be your boy and girl. You go back and forth from being a boy and girl.  Yeah. And it's like any party you go to, you win. Hmm. You know, it's like never salsa's party not to meet chicks. You always fucking win.  It's all confusing. Well yeah, it is all confusing. I don't know. Do whatever you want to do.  That's all you can do. Whatever you want, do whatever you want to do. Just be to be that big of a deal. It's the problem is as big of a deal for other people.  Like that's that's where it really becomes a problem.  If someone is anything, whether they're very masculine, very feminine, very gay, very straight. The problem is not what they're doing. The problem is how other people think about what they're doing and whether or not they give them a hard time for they think it's wrong.  It's not it's not for you to judge if it's exactly that's where when when it comes to like religion, like, why do people focus?  That's a big one that I always get weirded out with about, particularly with Christians.  It's like, why do you care? Because if you if you really want to focus on the Bible, there's so much shit in there that you're not supposed to be doing. You're not supposed to eat shellfish.  You're not supposed to eat certain types of animals. You're not supposed to wear different to different types of cloth. Like if you want to follow the old school, don't nobody wants to follow, too.  It's crazy you. But why do they care about the gay part, though? Why is that part like it's a freedom issue? It's very clear that those two guys, whether they're gay or straight, they wanted to suck Joe Exotics Dick, OK, that's why they were there.  They wanted to you hanging around with tigers. They made the movie. They did it because they like tigers. So the sucking dicks so they can hang out with tigers. But for whatever reason, they decided that doing it was better than not doing it, particularly as both of them could have beat the fuck out of him any time they wanted to. The one guy was gigantic.  There was one young kid like the modern looking kid was a gorilla.  He was fucking gigantic with huge ass hands. I know you don't me to beat the shit out of that dude, but the one guy with a beat, the guy with three teeth, he would have beat the shit out of him, too. Yeah. Would have beat the shit out. So say like that's what I like it. Get right in that gap.  Yeah. Oh yeah. I've had a toothless blowjob from a tattooed motherfucker.  You live the tattooed motherfucker with your name tattooed above his back. Yeah. Sorry I didn't say something like that.  Something. What did it say. But all those tiger motherfuckers was trickery and some kind of way. Everyone it was so they were all freaky. But I you know, I feel like it's. It almost doesn't seem real. It's the show so crazy there doesn't seem. It's so crazy that a lot of people feel like it's played out, like people talk about it too much.  Yeah, they just hit it. But the thing about it, when I say marketing, whatever he knew. Everything we do record that shit that the same guys at a different one, not only that, they don't know, he's got to see what the tattoo is. That's like Halloween right there.  Know there's another one above his dick that he got covered up with a bull. There it is right there.  Bangle Charlamagne, a guy right there. Absolutely. What does it say? Privately owned. Yeah, Joe. Exotic, privately owned and legally turned it into scribbles and a bull.  He can still see the actual lot he decided did not totally cover it. That's like indicative of his whole life.  Did you see the follow up? Did you see the follow up? They did. He was like he was year. A tattoo was a little offended because they didn't give his property. See, the tattoo was fucked up. Yo, the about not the fact that I was blowing his do like that. Yeah. We didn't like the way that tattoo was treated well didn't I.  That's why I got confused. I thought that they were all on meth right then at some point. But what did that guy say. That he hasn't done anything in like four years.  I think he said that wasn't from meth or something. Oh, OK. Hey, what it is. What it is. Yeah. But they got hit by an animal.  That's true, too. Like a lot of hockey players have no fucking teeth, but they that's a badge of honor for hockey players.  They don't give they got enough to fucking like, fuck that shit, like to take them out, show you in Canada you see a like that.  You think he's a millionaire and fucking and fucking Ohio's like that motherfucker hitting that myth.  Have you ever seen the photograph of that old school hockey player who has all these scars all over his face? No, I don't know you. I'm talking about Jamie.  It was a recreation of every scar this guy had ever had on his face over his career. It's a famous photograph. And you could see these.  I mean, it looks like he's just been in a fucking boxcutter fight, his whole face butchered. Yeah. Because all they did was look at this guy's face. Yeah, that's it. And what was it that large. Yeah. Yeah, bro.  He's a goalie before they were masks bro. Panel, I want them Kazaks. A cosmetic surgery facilities in L.A..  Dude, he was a goalie before they used fucking masks.  Look at him before he was just straight face.  They would just take it in the mug. Son, you mentioned a guy slapstick in one of those fucking hard ass pucks. How fast can they make those things go now?  They can make them go well over one hundred and twenty five forty. That graphic. What?  Oh, my God. Really fast, slapshot. Yeah, I think it's even probably faster.  Have you seen that video of that dude who does that long drive with the golf club? Do you know I'm talking about this is Jack too.  This is really Jack dude who hits his. He's got this crazy step through Happy Madison or Happy Gilmore type stroke to it and he makes the ball, you know, it's like one of those outdoor ranges. It flies over the back net. It's the most ridiculous thing I've ever seen in my life.  Oh, you probably saw a clip of somebody hit it out of, like at the top shot golf. Have you seen but you've seen that one guy who step sideways. He steps to it like Happy Gilmore.  He's about to kill it. It's bonkers how far that thing flies.  I want to find out with that baseball player when he holds the maybe he looks like a baseball.  He's a big dude. He looks like he looks like a pro baseball player, but he holds the long distance world record for for a golf ball drive, like drove it the furthest. So he holds the record. Do it. It's the crazy shit I've ever seen in my life.  But I'm not I don't follow hockey like that. I've been to one hockey machos in New York, I think with the Rangers played somebody, but I've been to a couple.  They're fun. It's wild in person, you know, it's on TV. There's a lot of things like that. Stand Up is a good example. There's a lot of things like that. We see it on TV is as looks good. But if you they're like, oh, shit, you watch people skate by and fire.  That's what the interest for me then, you know. Yeah, I'm black. You're a hockey mom. You like you just want to see a fight like this when you don't even know who's playing who you like. Oh shit. He just fucked him up. Do you know how to fight now?  There's some hockey fights where you watch guys throw like Chris punches like with technique, you know, like, oh Jesus.  You think they train for one hundred percent. Yeah, yeah. You can fight.  It's the only sport where you can fight. Like look you do you practice hitting the puck. Yeah. OK, we'll practice beating the fuck out of people do that too. That's part of the game.  Part of the game is beating the fuck out of each other. That's the game over. Well there's no other sport. Just stop and think about that. No, no other sport. We could fight bareknuckle in the middle of an ice skating rink at a drop of a hat, but they continue and continue to be friends at the end of the shit.  And the referees, I'll let you do it. They step back.  Yeah, never. I keep talking to. They never like. Fuck. Yeah. See you to Mars. Like, pop up. I got it.  There's some videos of dudes getting flatline though. It's different than it was back in the day because back in the day they were tough guys who knew how to skate and could maybe fight a little bit.  And so they'd grab each other's fucking their jackets or grab their their clothes and they'd be punching each other. Slam and move it all now dudes are hitting guys with hip throws and slamming them on the ice, knocking them unconscious.  I seen a dude hit a guy with a perfect counter right hand.  A dude swung on him. He backed up like this to right there, let it pass. Right. Slap just him. Like the more that guy could face.  That's a that's a guy with real skill. That's a smart motherfucker. Yeah. He just stood right in front of the guy. Let the guy throw a punch and then boom countered.  I couldn't even imagine having you know, you might have to fight to balance yourself on skates is just like Dukat. I wonder how you compare that to ask this guy.  This guy hijacks it got he didn't even really run up to it called the swingman. That's what I'm saying. He doesn't run up to it, but he picks his leg up. It's a weird motss move. See that boom. You got a bunch of videos of him, 106 miles an hour for the fastest laps.  That's insane. That's so fast with that puck. One hundred and six miles an hour, that puck hits you in the face.  Somebody that can pitch that fast, too, right? I don't know the world record of pitches.  What's the world record pitch? I'll just have my guess. My guess. One eleven. Is that ridiculous? One of five yachters Chapman.  Damn, that's funny. How do you hit that is going to be connected with this shit? You do not you don't hit that right. How many times can they throw that fast.  That's you can do it a couple of times in a row. I think he burns his arm out pretty fast. I would imagine.  I would imagine. How could you not burn your arm out? Think of how much explosion is involved in this. God damn, that was a that was a blink of an eye. It's interesting, like the mechanics of when you watch a real amazing picture, this is crazy body talk going on. Look at this whip. There's so much in that man, just like there's so much mechanical movement and leverage in your legs and eyes and coordinate.  It's like within the last ten years, it was about nine years ago.  There's this video of the bird that's flying by Wright when the pitch comes at it and I caught it in slow mo explodes. That was great. Was it Randy Johnson?  Yes, right. Oh, yeah. Randy Johnson, the rocket. He used to tear shit up. He was exciting. He I don't know when his doing his era, people were excited because all of the news I watched this was this.  He hit the bird right in mid-flight in the bird, exploded to the end for that birdie. How the fuck? Look at the world has a plan. Here's your plan.  Berdy Booya Karshi. Oh, yeah.  Great basket got leveled. That's fucking made that bird ceremony level. Nothing.  No, that bird's dead as fuck. Imagine that I mean, that dude's throwing 100 miles an hour, right, or Niños also made something, told me not to turn right there. What's that? Matt. I don't know, just whenever I buy it, I go, oh, wow, I got lucky, I didn't know what I didn't know. That's the Randy Johnson. Yeah, there's a couple not one minute video Birket, is it?  Mechanics did go back to that. The video, again, the part where Randy Johnson look at look at the mechanics of how he throws his body into that pitch.  Look at this. Yep. You step off. There's so much it's like a little coordinated movement.  He's built every little matter. Yeah. What more can leverage no matter what someone who's that big, they'll just think about all that leverage, man.  Plus he can reach almost a foot closer, if not more than that, than any other pitcher. So he's literally releasing it at a closer distance than anybody else, you know. So, yes, less time.  That's true. That's a good way to look at it. The leverage is leverage is interesting, man, you know, because it's such a such a huge factor in some sports, you have ever throw a pitch out?  No way. I don't want to hurt my shoulder.  It's just like your ego because they have one shot of 50 Cent throwing the pitch out. Oh, no. And he looked so great doing it. It was funny. You see, I think he probably had that deleted from the Internet. I just saw this yesterday.  I don't know why I was coming around, but it was about Jackson throwing somebody out flat footed from the outfield. That's not to say it's not this one, but it's his next one.  Official, Bo Jackson was one of the freakiest athletes of all time.  His arm is so crazy. Everything was crazy.  If he didn't get hurt in that football game. Look at this. Jumps off the wall. So he avoids all the impact. Literally just ran up the wall.  Yeah, both bold new everything. He's a very amazing guy.  That was just two sports play to sports, but world class at both sports. It wasn't until the football injury that he had to get a hip replacement.  And that's one of the he was the first person you picked, like I got this going. What's in everything?  Anything and everything to certain dudes just have the perfect build, the perfect genetics and then work ethic.  Another one is a Herschel Walker like Herschel Walker are destroyed now. Better than not be. How could they not be? Yeah, they say like he can barely like he can barely walk now. He'll still fuck you up.  Herschel Walker, he was fucking people up in strike force when he was in his late 40s.  I was thinking, Earl Campbell, someone is like really, really like that. I don't think Herschel Walker has bad knees. He was fighting almost until he was fifty. He was fighting and strike force. A lot of you know. Yeah.  Herschel Walker at forty eight, forty nine, whatever he was when he's fighting, looked like a thirty year old perfect specimen of an athlete.  He didn't look like an older athlete doing something different, like trying to like it looks like he's fucking world class ripped full six pack super jacked still at forty eight at forty. What's, what is his age there. What does it say. Forty eight. Forty eight. Look at that right there. Yes.  To look at the build on this fucking guy and he destroyed the student strike force. He beat a few guys, he was undefeated in May and the way he would beat these guys was just first of all he had a long martial arts background like done martial arts before.  And I've never known know any of this. But he's got such a crazy, disciplined work ethic that, like his body is still in pristine shape in his late 40s.  Now, I don't know if he's taken hormones or anything here, but either way, the way this guy looked in his 40s and the way I mean, just like his face, his face lift him.  Yeah, that's crazy.  That guy would do push ups and sit ups and body weight squats and shit over weight lifting.  That was like his big thing was that he did mostly calisthenics.  I had no idea that he ever did.  That dude, Herschel Walker was a to say, you know, everything to his.  That's the thing. When when he started fighting, people were like, oh, you know, he's like a guy who still wants to compete, who used to be world class is something he probably won't be good at fighting.  Right. Fucking people. I mean, look at me. Just look at it. Didn't look like it was just like a show like, I don't know. He looks like a professional mixed martial arts fighter.  I wouldn't say he looked like the best in the world, but he was professional and he even went to one of the best gyms in the world. He went to a.k.a. KS in San Jose. It's one of the best mixed martial arts. Cain Velasquez, Daniel Cormier, Jon Fitch, Josh Koscheck mean go down the list. He trained fighters came out of there. Yeah, it's a great gym and they have been training world class fighters forever.  So he went to the Lion's Den, would normally medoff training. He went to Mike Swick trained there. I mean, it's the he was the Comedy Store.  He went to college. He went to the comedy. He went right in there and he trained there.  Look at that. Look at that Bill. Come on, man. Who the fuck looks like that in the late forties and does professional cage fighting after a long career in the NFL?  Was there something special? Man, he was had no idea.  Oh, my God, dude. And I'm telling you, every fight was like this. Every fight was like a man versus boy.  I watched to watch them all. Of course you do. I watch everything and you don't question. I watch a lot of shit.  I'm not like a lot of shit. Yeah, you read a lot of audiobooks too. I do. You read a lot. You read a lot or you read a lot of audio books.  But I don't know what to say. You read a lot of audiobooks.  I mostly read articles, but I get my books, I consume my books and audio form because I can do other shit like I'm going to walk when I walk my dog.  I will listen to a book when I was talking to the person who helped me with the Kindle and I got the fact about the will shit, I was like, this motherfucker is going to be all over this shit, ambergris. I knew it. I was like. This is right up his sperm whales, that is just to dissolve beaks. That's what I mean, like pearls, right? That's just like a coating that an oyster puts over a rock or something that's inside its mouth.  Isn't that what it is?  He gets irritated and creates his coating and puts it over and it becomes super value to us.  How long? But that's over. Well, it can't be a long time because oysters not don't live. So what's the time period? How long do you need to develop a pearl?  Well, let's just guess is a total guess. How long do you think an oyster stays alive? If you had a guess, like how how old is an oyster? I'll say I'll say 15 years. Wow.  I was going to say three. I would love to know the answer. I wonder if they know, well, you know, they don't want to be pulled up. I think they don't know how old sharks get.  Well, it takes I just it takes two to four years for it to form the pearl, but they live anywhere from two to 41 years, 41 years for an oyster.  Mollis, Joe? I don't know. I was closest to you say to two. It's two. I said 17 and three.  I'm one away. This is oysters to Joe.  And that I want I just want to get tested. It doesn't effectivity to to 41.  It's like, well, sometimes babies die when they're one day old. How old are people. Forty one.  But I was closer. Yeah. Oh OK. I'll give it to you. I was closer to life expectancy. I thought about that.  I thought it was like like an octopus because octopus is a real quick right. Octopus are real smart but they, I think they have a very short lifespan.  I think octopus, the brain of a of a human, they're fucking clever, they're clever and they're mean and shit and are smart.  Yeah. They're like an evil alien.  That's what they look they're in the same family molluscs. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So like that's why it's similar.  There's a crustacean the same as a mask isn't related.  So I'm not, they're not like the same, same boat is a shellfish a crustacean because a crab is a crustacean. Right. I just like saying big words.  They are all like crustacean. I know. Like you just do that. What's that.  Restaurant crab crustacean. That's the only time I use that word.  Oysters, bivalve and the octopus, whatever. Octopus. Is it like a gastropod or cephalopod. Yeah, I was. That's right.  This is the life expectancy of what's a settler.  It it's like two to four years depending on. Yeah, yeah. Look at it before. Right. OK, yeah. We have two to four years is nothing for something that's smart. That's what's so weird.  Imagine you're more than smart. They can't live longer than that motherfucker. Dummy tools. There's no doctors under there. They do grow their limbs back. And when and when males and females breed, sometimes the female just decides to kill the male and eat it.  Females are larger Haberkorn team that's coming out of Quarte Motherfucker. If we make this all your limbs, we're going to eat dead males.  Octopuses. Dick is also his limbs. What does it say? The largest bivalve is a giant clam which reaches a length of four feet and weighs 500 pounds.  Holy shit. Holy shit. Did you know that a four foot clam that weighs 500 pounds. That's crazy. That's like The Little Mermaid lives in there.  Is it part of a menu? I mean, do people. Oh, we should eat the fuck out of that thing. At least 500 years old. It's also the oldest known animal can live to 500 years old to to 500 years ago.  Yeah, I was the closest to a guest on that one.  That's not raising bull octopuses. Dick is also its tentacles, and sometimes it has to give up its dick.  It is like let it arms separate so that the female doesn't eat it because females would just jack it to dig the well.  They eat the arm. They'll take his dick, which is also his arm, to take one of his tentacles and they'll eat that. And like it's almost like he's like, here, eat my arm. I'm not so gross back, dude.  It's a crazy shit ever. There's a lot of videos of it. Female octopuses, just jack male octopuses and kill them and eat them when they are the arm.  You don't know their whole body is the same thing and they stuff them, they stuff them into like holes in the reef and just peck away at them for days, you know, why do you sell as much stuff when you get more excited about more and more and more?  I'm fascinated by that shit. You're fascinated about every guy.  But this is something to be fascinated by because this is a living thing that we can look, if we found this on another planet, we'd be freaking the fuck out if they sent one of those.  Probes those like Mars probes to another planet, and they found this just laying in an ocean somewhere and they studied this, this is the life form on this planet that's dominant. And sometimes the females, which are super intelligent, sometimes to just kill the males and eat them. That's what this guy is doing. This this girl, rather, is killing this guy. She's killing him right now. She's strangling him and biting, letting him.  The fact that you could do a play by play, that's might have been one of the most impressive things I've seen their meaning of octopus eaten up and mean they don't live. It tastes good, too.  They taste real good, but they're smart calamari all day. That's squid. I don't think they're smart.  Oh, yeah. I don't think squid are that smart. They smart. Who's smarter?  I, I'm sure they change color and stuff. Oh that's true. What is the other one that does cuttlefish. Cuttlefish does.  That's a little fat ones. The ones that blow up. No that's a puffer. Yeah. Cuttlefish is like this weird thing that's like it's not quite a squid, it's not quite an octopus but it looks a lot like them. It's a similar thing and it can change colors and that's what it looks like.  That thing's freaky.  But get a video, see if there's a video that this is weird too.  This is these things just to do cuttlefish camouflage. Do they look exactly like they're surrounding and they just jack things like that.  So they blend in perfectly with the environment, even the texture. They can look like coral. Look at that. Oh, yeah.  They can look like the rocks on the bottom. They look like all kinds of different things and they can change really quickly to blend in with whatever the background is. They're freaky, man. That's crazy.  They're really freaky when they taste.  I forget the name of anything. I think they taste people eat them. I know that people eat anything.  They eat cuttlefish. I think it's like a like a luxury fish.  It's like, you know, very I think it's highly sought after in some ethnic cooking's. Right. Like Asian style cooking.  I know I've had it. I know I've had it.  Cooked cuttlefish cooking tips. Mm.  Yeah. I don't know. Yeah well you do elk. So cuttlefish is not you can't be farmed octopus. You've had squid. It's not that much difference. I know you could sell me on it because I tried different things, but certain places you go, you're just a chick with a sloppy mustache.  Yeah. Yeah. People love that she's chowing down on dude that looks good as fuck.  That looks real good but looks weird. Looks like an alien thing I could do. It's just like squid.  She says if you saw that on another planet, if they found an animal underwater on another planet, they could change colour and blend in with its environment. They don't even know how the fuck it does that. They don't know how they do that. They watch him do that and they try to figure out how the fuck this thing instantly mimics the texture of coral and blends right in. But that's years of evolution. Oh, for sure.  But I mean, it's it's beyond what anything else on this planet can do.  You look at, like what we can do. We can do shit and we do and will be exactly like we reproduce. Yes. And the act of that is the simplest thing you could do in your life, the act of reproduction. Oh my. It's oh it makes the you know, nine months later you're responsible for some. True.  Yeah. And it's your your body's programmed to want that more than anything to reproduce or the sex to get the this.  Oh yeah.  But then programme for that and to reproduce though ultimately that's what's crazy about.  So that's what somebody could say to my cheat day was like I was just feeding my need to reproduce you because say I was just being unfaithful.  I don't think that's going to fly OK, but it's amazing that it wasn't so much of our society is based on the sexual desire.  Right.  It really is just a call to reproduce a girl's ass and a girl with big tits and small waist like you see that it's like a program that runs in the brain that gets the body saying, oh, you you need to get her.  You need to make it easier to go slow. Yeah. But it is something that comes that becomes get to a mental part too. And that's that happens with women and guys.  You know, people should meet up for dates and get tested once they get testing everywhere and people should meet up for dates, get tested and then go out because of a fun little thing to do.  Yeah, it would be. It would be. I would tell it's going to go back to that second wave. Yeah. Somebody is going to slip through some eyes, like, you know, it's like I wish I knew if that's the case.  I don't know.  I don't know this situation, man. This situation, it's going to change for so much. Shipborough the way people think about so much things. And it's going to you know, ultimately it'll make us a better people, a better place. It'll change a lot.  But we're still very fortunate and we should just use this time to make a better situation for ourselves.  I said we can do that. I say that to. I say it's a. It was like, it's easy to get down, it's easy to have an excuse why you don't want to do something but you know, or you could challenge it and that's what it is.  The real problem is people with families that lost their job. That's a real problem, being able to put food on the table, people being able to, you know, they want to get their business back up. How can they possibly make a living again?  It's not like anything else where people lost their business, didn't make any bad mistakes. You know, if a person makes a bunch of bad mistakes and they lose their business, they kind of at least know what happened. But when all of a sudden, if you've been working hard your whole life, you have a successful business and then, boom, the floor falls out in a month.  Yeah, but I will say, I mean, what I get from companies that they have been or trying to be as aggressive with keeping small businesses alive more than anything.  Yeah. And that's a good move. It's very important in restaurants, small businesses. But, you know, already there was a thing today and I think was The Washington Post where they were talking about how they're already out of that money that they deemed for small business loans.  There was an out there already this very because I know what I went back for more money to do.  That was today. Yeah. I was reading something today. I don't know what paper it was, but there were The Washington Post. All of them. All of them.  And it's basically saying that they need to figure out how to keep doing this. If they're going to if we're going to social distance, particularly in California, like where the idea is May 19th or May 15th. Is that what it is?  May 15th, I think, in terms of now. Yeah.  I mean, and how are they going to start it back up and what are they going to do, start it back up? And what what are people going to be like? Like how long is it going to take before everybody settles back in again? You know, they don't they don't really know. They don't.  But it feels like if they they eased up or is it up that that's going to be more for, like you say, people that work? Mm hmm. Right. Yeah. That's where the issue would come in is like how people are going to feel comfortable going to work.  Right. If we were talking about guys who work at grocery stores. Right. Who used to work at the grocery store, it was just a job.  Now it's a job that could kill you. Like what? Like it doesn't even pay that. Well, imagine a job that doesn't pay. We're going to kill you. Yeah. So imagine being there right now and dealing with these people, coughing and walking back and forth everywhere you look, all these new people, all you're being constantly exposed to these people's air.  And he used to just be a regular job. Now suddenly it's a regular job that might get you so sick you could die like, fuck, that's why they bought this.  They're going to coach. You got to fucking raise that minimum wage. Now, watch. That's going to probably happen. Well, I guarantee you that'll probably happen.  This is what we're realizing in all of this, is that if you do have a crisis, this is the good thing.  The vast majority of people comply with what's needed to, you know, stay home, just go to the supermarket, do essential things, come back, just stay home.  Let's just let this shit die off. Let the people that have it right now, let them get to a point where they're not transmitting it to anybody else anymore. Everybody stay away from each other and let's just nip it in the bud. And the way you look at it in terms of like different philosophies of different places that have done it, some places have not been so aggressive and they've experienced a lot of cases. And you could say, well, yeah, but those people, they're going to it's going to go through their immune system quicker and they'll be able to go back to work quicker.  Yeah, I don't know. I don't know. But I do know that California has a very low number of deaths, in particular in a low number of it's a low number of people that have gotten gravely ill in comparison to the size of the state.  Like if you compare it to New York, which is a very high, you can't get a population of five, like 5.5 million in Brooklyn and everyone's on top and everybody is.  I was so shocked. It is an epic epicenter. It's because everybody's there and everybody up in the sky.  It's all about like when do you jump?  Like, when do you make a move in California made a move a little bit quicker, you know, and it's it's that's that's really what it is like who acts the quickest and you got to do it.  I do understand, like the tough mandates because. You have to lay it down because people will be easy and lax with who they are, but there's also people that are getting too much of a kick out of telling people what to do, you know, like kicking people out of parks when it's like a family of three and there's no one else in the park. Like, come on, like, relax, there's no one here.  If you're there and there's no one else there, leave the fucking people alone. Let them enjoy the park. Now, if other people come and they get too close to each other, then step in and stop them.  But I mean, if they do it like that, there's always going to be somebody is going to try to push you so I can try and just get it to, I guess, to be like, fuck it, nobody. Yeah.  I mean, like, I took my son for a walk the other day and, like, he doesn't really know what's going on, but he knows what's going on.  And he was on his little scooter. Right. And I'm like, he was just happy to be out. Right. Just, you know, and he had his mask when I was like, is that the future? You know, the little man, a little mess.  I'm like, we're going to get so weird with each other. I mean, if you wanted a formula, right? If you were if you if you wanted to be a real conspiracy theorist and you wanted the formula to get people.  Ta ta, more, more easily be separated and more easily give in to the future of machines taking over the world. This is what you do. You give him a fucking disease or they can't even be human anymore. They can't hug each other. They can't kiss. They can't even get close because they're worried they're going to get a disease is going to kill them. So what do you make them do on top of that? You make them wear a mask.  So now you can even see each other's facial expressions. You can't even look a person in the eye. You just see, like you said, this is only.  Yeah, but something is going to make. I understand, but something is going to make those people feel more comfortable, quicker testing with quicker results. A vaccine. Don't know how long it's going to take to get it, but something is going to give people a vote of confidence. And that's going to be with those numbers of like people weren't excited by what is what is it called flattened out. They like, oh, shit. Flattening the curve.  Yes, slatina curve is going to be something to give people more confidence. And then when people have more confidence, some people are going to push it. Right. And some people are going to be like like we say, it's going to be the new normal. They're going to be doing taking extra precautions. I don't know. The next time I'll do a meet and greet, write a meet and greet that part of pretty much that part of our business is going to be gone for for some time for sure.  Do you remember that spring break for those kids they caught down in Mexico? Yeah. Going crazy, or is it Florida? It was Florida. Might as well Mexico.  Florida is not America. Right.  Let's go through this shit happens in Florida. That is not America. So they go down there. I mean, if you're from Florida, relax. I'm joking. They're not going to relax. Relax. They're going to be a for my sister lives in Florida for that.  This went downhill. They'll blame it on me for fifty nine.  If you hated Florida, get them those kids watching those kids on the beach. Oh, because there was no laws that there was no law yet. So these kids, they move slowly. They were like the last state. Right. They were last state.  Well they went to Florida just said that professional wrestling is an essential business really.  But that is hilarious. That's true.  Right. What is the exact state? Because I don't want to because it sounds so ridiculous. I don't want to fuck this up.  They said they rushed to judgment. I think they might have just reevaluated things. Oh, did they reevaluate it now?  Yeah. Yeah. No, not the original. Original. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  Oh, you know, they're going to be taping this weekend.  But if a show if it was a show, it's a show that gives people jobs and is produced, it's create jobs. Other people. Couldn't that be considered a central job to the people that worked there. Yes.  So every job is essential then. That's what I was trying to say, yeah. Xabi is now considered essential service in Florida. It's a service.  Officials in the state permitted employees of professional sports and media production with a national audience to hold an event if it is closed to the public.  Yeah, I think you should be able to if you test everybody and everybody's negative and like, again, test takes fifteen minutes and apparently they're working on ones that work a lot quicker.  Can I say that? I said that's when it's going to shift. I like I say, people getting somewhat a little bit of a vote of confidence when you know that you could get results rapid.  Yeah, I want to know if they made it in a lab or if they got them. They got together. I want to go.  No, I mean, the virus itself, the the big theory is not just not even that they made in a lab. That's not what they think. What they do think is it escape from a lab and that this was something that they were working on in this lab with the very same type of bats they're working on in this lab. This is reported by Fox News.  I believe they have a lab there. They're working on bats. Are they working on viruses? And it came from the very area. It's not it's not impossible to pretend it's impossible.  Seems a little crazy for me that I heard it might be my best story was somebody my back my story was a bat and a snake was involved with some kind of way.  There's a pangolin. People thought that it was that bats like this is someone told me that bats transferred over to pangolins, which is this weird fuckin armadillo looking creature.  I know you, me, the little funny look. Weird thing. Yeah, I know. It's like a dinosaur looking thing.  Yeah. And that somehow or another that got to people. But then they thought it was a lady who was patient zero who worked next to a stand that was selling bats. But this article claims that the wet market, the whole reason why that story got out, it was a cover story for the fact that it escaped from their lab. But of course, that sounds so much like a plot in a movie.  Like you read it and you go, why? It's almost too attractive.  Every other news reporting like CNN, NBC is that says that the US officials are now looking into that unverified theory pushed. By Boxer Day, it doesn't say Fox. You said things like that, President Trump plotting a movie, this whole thing feels like 100 percent like a movie, like to see Times Square.  Yeah, but nobody. Nobody. Yeah, nobody. My friend John Joseph took a run off across the Brooklyn Bridge and took a picture of him standing on top of the Brooklyn Bridge on Instagram and behind him. It's just empty, like like I am legend shit. Yeah. It's like a couple people in the background. You can see them.  Wafaa, far in the background, but a normal day on the Brooklyn Bridge where people walk, you get hit trying to. Yeah, but I believe that it's going to my beliefs don't mean may not mean too much to anybody but has to start back up again.  When is the big question and what is it going to be like.  You know, I hope people just happens to be a continuation of I think it would be a continuation of what's going on down now, going on right now with the social distancing and stuff. But it's just like businesses aren't open because but this is going to be just going to be six foot. It's going to be six feet mass and everything for a while. You can believe that shit for a while.  Yeah, I imagine the people that were already germ freaks right there. And I was like I said, it's a germ freak. Neal Brennan and white people, Neil Brennan and White podcasters knew that this was going to happen.  They knew they knew it was going to be a point where we're not going to go on a roll. We'll be good. And no, Britain is a germ phobe. And I laughed at him. I even called him gay for a fist bump.  And everybody he knew he did a year ago. I never thought this was happening. You knew it could have happened, though, somewhere in your imagination. I know there was a scenario or story. You if anybody would have been like, what if I think you seen this movie in your brain?  I've seen a bunch of movies in my brain. That's what bothers me.  What bothers me is complacency, that I think it's real easy for people to just keep on keeping on. And I think if you look at a lot of the problems that we have in our culture are from poor decision making and more people choose comfort over doing a smarter thing. That's harder to do. That's going to help your life the easier way.  Yeah, it's real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real, real common with people.  It's part of you. It's part of me. I have it in my head. We all have it. We all fight it. Right. This is making you realize what's really important.  You want to persist.  This is what this is when you can realize, like, oh, me losing weight is not about me looking good. It's about me staying alive. Like it might be the difference in me dying from this shit or skating through it.  It makes you and then it makes you think about it. When we weren't thinking about it at all. Exactly. We went, think, well, think about it. You see you the date I seen motherfuckers. You go to my airport, motherfuckers, you know, quick piss in and out or whatever you got, motherfucker. Just like, got it. But come right out the joint. Don't watch your hands there anything. Clearly I didn't even think I was.  I was. I know about wash your hands, whatever. But I didn't know that hand sanitizer was that gangster.  Yo, I've got to have him tell him sentence was gay, like, all right, all you all missed all germophobia. But then you realize those precautions moving forward. Those are going to help us.  Yeah, you got to be. And you got to understand that every surface that you touch has been touched by a bunch of other people. It has the potential to have something on it. And that's just how it is. It doesn't mean you shouldn't touch things anymore. Just be real careful what you do with your face afterwards. It's like a conscious space that you take for granted. You take for granted like it's easy, it's easy. Just like, hey, what's up?  Yeah, I know that.  But the other thing is the stuff that you get in contact with your immune system gets stronger when you're in contact with more things like kids, particularly when they're young. They say, you know, they used to have what were they called chicken pox?  Yeah, we have to have a party. I was invited, but I didn't know why people did that to I apparently I read about it.  Yeah, but it's just I just I think it's just a common thing that Americans did back before they gave kids vaccines for it.  Once you got chicken pox, it was about to be a sleepover and everybody getting get it out of the way. I'll just tell you about the other day.  Apparently, it's real bad when you get it when you're an adult.  Yeah, not good. Yeah. Same with the measles. Measles. Well, measles kills kids to, too.  If you say if you have an adult with chickenpox, do you like where the fuck did you go?  Where have you been. Chickenpox, motherfucker.  And by the way, how do you not get vaccinated for that by this time? There's a chicken pox vaccine, right?  I had it when I was kid. You can tell the. Oh, my God, this shit right there, the little.  Yeah, well, that's also that chicken pox that one. Or is that. I think that's smallpox. Two things. Measles. We got there's a bunch of vaccinations checking our vaccinations scarred us up when we were kids, right? I had one in my arm like my whole life.  I had this weird scar on the top, my old school scar chicken. Look at you. Oh, you got one of those like an old school. Yeah.  You got in 1995, the vaccine varicella before there were four million cases a year.  That's crazy. That's crazy.  Who's going to be harmed?  There's going to be a comedy club that says. Phuket was get opening, someone's do it. Somebody's going to do it. You just can't make people sign waivers. Say the club's not responsible if you get sick, you know, irresponsible to do. Is that irresponsible to do? I don't know. Is it look, tell people to get tested. Tell them to get tested when it's available, when testing is readily available and treatments are readily available, I think only then are we going to relax.  Yeah, I said it. Yep, it's the truth.  Then the question is like, well, how do you tell people that you don't have it? Like if you go to a bar, are you going to submit to having an app?  That's I've heard that there may be some type I heard in Mohana or whatever. They have some type of system where it is an app where I guess you register and you could scan and see. I know that has to be in development to I was just talking to somebody about it. I don't know exactly what it is, but I think that that technology exists.  Do you follow Willie D from the Ghetto Boys? Yeah.  Go to his Instagram and he's got a post where there's a company that's sticking a microchip in these people's arms. They hired a fucking professional tattooist and piercer, a professional piercer.  And what could do has to come for you to get what the fuck.  Imagine if your company tells you to. I know. I know you don't want to bring keys. You know, if I bring keys everywhere, I just going to give you a little microchip. I'm going to make sure you're showing up work on time me enough to punch in anymore. You're all set. You literally like going to go for it.  They're going for it in this video, laughing and joking around about it. That is real, right?  Yeah. I wouldn't get hopes. Do we get hosed because it was it's a news story, believe it or not.  I don't know about it on his page, but I know. I know exactly.  We're talking about something I watched it almost like if you fuck about it. How are they thinking? It's the same. There it is.  This company embeds microchips in its employees and they love it.  That and the employees at times, Greenmarket got RFID because in their hands, those are probably people that know that anything.  They probably know that anything that the government wants to find out about who they can find it out whenever they want.  Look at this. When Patrick McMullan wants a diet, Dr. Pepper, while he's at work, he pays for it with a wave of his hand.  Oh, well, definitely don't carry credit cards anymore. That's too hard to do.  There's just do did let him put a microchip in you pet with a wave of your hand.  I think LaGuardia, one of the airports in New York, has got the experimental thing going where they have. And one of the terminals, a place where you can go shop, you just swipe your credit card when you walk in and usually with whatever you got and they charge you like like those Amazon stores. It's the same technology. I guess Amazon's licensing it out. Well, that makes sense.  It's still a credit card, though, like it's not a chip business or you don't wave your card. I think you just have your phone with you kind of.  And it's just like knows that you have as long as you can leave it at home, you can't leave at home. This is what's so crazy about this. How hard is it, you lazy bitch? You can't pull your fucking credit card out. You're willing to let them put a microchip in there so you can get a diet. Dr. Pepper. Hello. My move.  You can loan somebody money with ADAP at his office. He's one of dozens of employees who've been doing likewise for a year now.  That's very funny. Imagine that's how you give it to the money.  Yeah, like that. That's a cash slap you can't touch now because Cronos, you know, I mean. Oh, yeah, that's what I couldn't pay. You brought social distancing.  McMullen is the president of Three Square Market, a technology company that provides self-service mini markets to hospitals, hotels and company break rooms. Last August, he became one of roughly 50 employees at its headquarters in River Falls, Wisconsin. Would volunteered to have a chip injected into their hand. Fucking yikes. What I saw was a do was getting it in his forearm. I was it. It must be a different company. So this is what's scary. Is this going to be the new norm?  Like what if you get fired by these people and you get hired by Amazon, do you have to put in one of their chips to have to take out your old chip? Do they sell the chip to the company?  We've been this would be when you leave, give me my chip back.  Oh, my God. They cut you open. But that doesn't that does not surprise me in the least.  It doesn't surprise me, but it alarms me. It alarms me.  The people are so interested in having someone put a chip in their body, but we have a company that tells you you have to do it. The company tells you you have to do that. Fuck that company. But I know it.  But those are people that feel that need they need to feel the need of being a part of new technology. I want it if that's the hot shit, motherfuckers going to have it.  This was 2014 says microchips will be implanted into healthy people sooner than you think it's going to happen. Yeah, it's going to happen.  I mean, they called it it's going to happen for 2014 for people like I say. Look, think about it, Joe. Somebody with Alzheimer's. Yeah.  You know, I'm saying they're going to find. A smart if somebody is abducted, you know, I'm saying it's like it's weird to think about it, but then if you really think about it, it's it's going to be weird, but it's still not. There's going to be plenty of reasons. People are going to say, tell me where your chip is and people don't want to tell us that.  Cut your hand off this article. I don't like it right here. The talks about this guy getting a oh, Jesus Christ, look at it. A year later, Gassan infected his own implant with a computer virus, one that could pass on to other computer systems if the building's networks were programmed to read his chip. As Gasol breezed around the workplace, spreading the virus and corrupting computer systems, certain areas of the building became inaccessible to his colleagues.  Jesus Christ, that's that's how that's how war is going to be fought. Just yeah, motherfucker, don't give a fuck.  If you can fight a war like this, who can hack this shit?  That's where the war is. It's not going to be that physical shit. It's going to be like you got one motherfucker in the room. Yeah. They could crash some shit like that. You know what that fucking do to everybody?  Dude, I was watching this video of this couple that was infected and they were being dragged out of this building by these security guards in hazmat suits in China.  You know, the police, or was that an exercise or was it real? It was real, yeah.  Because I just feel it was I want to say it was a man and his wife, the both tested positive. I don't remember that. But they were being dragged out there, been like picking them up, like they're like like they're criminals.  I saw some things. I don't know if it was just it just I don't know if it was just it might have just been associated with Carano or some other footage. I've seen some stuff with my focus, like they was pulling this one lady out and they fucking cracked her neck next, you know, she's on ice. Well, yeah, I can't remember. And, you know, people are crazy. And that might be somebody like a story.  Not only that, but they changed the headlines to get a different click bait.  Well, when something catastrophic starts happening and people start dying, people justify a lot of crazy shit, man. And one of the things that I bet people will justify is they'll justify manhandling people that they think are not complying with the rules or people that have the virus and then shit could get a real crazy.  If that becomes normal, it is going to become normal. Because you think about it like right now when you have cases of people getting frustrated, somebody is yo, you inside my bodies, all my social distance. And this is when everybody's not even out here.  Joe, is this in New York?  Why is this person getting dragged off whatever. In a mass. Oh, where am I? So they're just dragging them off because not complying.  Yeah. Yeah. Fucking crazy. No worse because they're all closer and yeah.  This is crazy. This is great. But it also is crazy that this guy doesn't think you should wear a mask when he's on a fucking bus crowded filled with people while there's a pandemic disease going on.  He should have a fucking mask on.  So where's the where's the happy metal?  The happy middle's not these cops grabbing this guy and physically yanking him off the bus and causing this, you know, very violent moment.  I think the thing we need is more but more broadly what that is like. Put your mask on, son.  Yeah, he didn't have a mask. Maybe he just didn't have it. Yeah.  We need to make masks available to people.  You don't want to lose your life.  Yeah, but those people on the bus, they're probably very happy that the cops came and pulled that guy off to Manchester.  Your mess, because he's got a mask and this guy doesn't like to lose your life for a fucking mask. Yeah, mask rules everything around me.  Well, there's a terrible video of a bus driver in Chicago and he makes this video talking about people were on his bus just coughing and constantly coughing with their mouth open. He's like, please. He's like, we're out here risking our health to do this service.  And, you know, you people are being completely disrespectful and not caring.  And four days later, he got it and now he's dead. So this guy, he's in this video and then a short time afterwards, he's dead.  For what he was talking about, I've heard so many cases of that dude, imagine all of a sudden you're you're a bus driver and instead of just driving a bus now, you're also worried you're going to die from a pandemic disease and you have to keep going to work and being surrounded by these people because someone has to drive people around them.  They did not get on the buses no more. No more. I get on the bus and I get on the bus when I start back up.  And what is it going to be like done now? Like what is it going to be like when the years get going again?  They start clinical and it's going to be it's going to look like the international terminal. For Fly Korea in Japan, that's what it's gonna look like, Muhlfeld going to be a mask for a wow, I think you're probably going to be messed up for a while. How long you think?  A year. Yeah, I mean, you got to be able to test vaccine. How do you get rid of it? You know, they're going to teach mothers how not to catch it.  OK, I got it. How do I get rid of it? And I was watching one of those shows on CNN with this black doctor, and she was talking about how they are close to a vaccine or something because they're just extending, I guess, certain testing. They were doing something else that had similar traits. I'm not a doctor. I don't know exactly the story, but it was a story of the study and a research of it had already started.  So they'd already been making the vaccine for the other stuff. Yeah. Was it SARS as though it wasn't SARS? It was some one of a new virus I'd never heard of.  But it was an interesting story because she was don't it was Guba, whatever the motherfuckers what it was. But it was a great conversation. Like what if. OK, we had they not we had, but. Had realized that something like this is about to happen because of this strain of something, this is going to be the next Hercules. How do we get ahead of it? There may be some people out there that had already been thinking that they're going to find something to cure the shit.  Well, they definitely been thinking that this could happen because I know it may sound crazy.  Certain shit. It's like I don't know what has got the world so involved that it wasn't specific to a race or anything. Just like like I just say in history, anybody could catch it. Anybody could catch it, you know.  Yeah, that's that's the panic. And that's what that's where the panic is in every community. The whole world, the whole world, the whole world covered with humans.  Everybody's got it. It's on every and every continent except in Africa, I think in part because the only place doesn't have cases. That's what's wild about human contact. And you think about how a disease can so quickly spread from China just all over the whole world and shut everything down.  They said that if China was honest about it, I don't know if this is true, but this is what I was reading.  And more than one different story, that China could have stopped 95 percent of the spread and they were just beginning.  And I know and they say if Donald Trump was honest about it, they could have said in mandates for social distancing and everything a little earlier.  I think a lot of people were real skeptical. Unfortunately, a lot of people were real skeptical. And no one no one anticipated it happening like this. They were giving him a hard time when he was saying that they should stop travel from China. People were calling him racist. Now, everybody stop travel from everywhere.  Yeah, but I want a lot of people want to call him racist for fucking got them anything if he just had coffee with no sugar. Well, see, this is the reason why I don't want to fuck with this motherfucker.  Well, you know, it's it gets the things get cloudy, right. Because, like, what is the thing? The thing is, he wants to stop travel from this place because of diseases in this place. And then the reaction is, well, that's racist to say and we should be more sensitive. And this is.  Yeah, but people understand and Donald Trump don't move off of emotions to things that he say is you got to understand, certain people are built like this. Certain people don't make decisions off of emotions. And that's what so many people get connected and disconnected with a can of whatever it's like. Yeah, I fucking rooted for him. Like, I get connected with the emotions of it in certain people like him and people of that like mine, which are mostly business people, they don't fuck with emotions, they only fuck with results.  It's like, oh, I feel sorry. Did you think, well, I bitch I don't care about none of that. That's not how I work.  But what my point was that if you got to give the guy a hard time about not reacting quick enough to certain things, you also got to give him props for shutting down traffic to places earlier.  But nobody wants to do that because it's a weird one, because the people that don't want to do that job is the ones that are put up in the emotion. The idea of people do not get deal with reality right there reality and not on a Trump and as just trying to harp on a Trump shit. But Isaiah Washington, you know, I started Washington. Yes, Grey's Anatomy. I know him from in Brooklyn. Whatever. He's a he's like like what are you, a Trump supporter?  He's like a loyal Trump supporter, you know. I mean, he's he's a he's he's he supports Trump. But I've heard him say he said, I don't vote for a person. I vote for policies. I vote for policies. And I'll give you an example.  Well, this is a weird one, Donald, because no one had ever experienced this before. So no one is doing the right thing, having experience experienced pandemics that shut down the whole world. So when he when anyone's doing anything right now, everyone's going to be criticized.  One hundred percent. But you got to do it like like what people don't like. I listen and watch both outlets, Fox and CNN. That's confusing, isn't it? It's just for CNN, just where, you know, CNN is like a nagging girlfriend.  It's like, oh, a bitch, shut the fuck up, this bitch. Yo, yo, you like seeing have you like bitch? Oh, you don't got to argue. About five years ago, you haven't found another. Are you being serious? We like you remember that time. You remember that time. Fox we like you.  I'm saying like you listen to if you listen to too much CNN brah, you don't even know what the fuck is going on with nothing other than how much you hate this motherfucker. Didn't used to be that way. I know CNN used to be pretty straight journalism. Yeah. It's like their relationship was so toxic for both of us.  So it's so for both of them. It's so I want to get you back.  It's so like, girl, let me get you back, girl. So it's so Popeye's Chicken girl you go eleven hours. This is a girl. It's so it's like when I saw it at the point I'm making is like but when I listen, when I listen to both because you want to hear both perspectives, if you care really care you listen to both. But then when I go to Fox I at least hear OK this is what our. This is what we want to do.  This is what the plans are. This is what the president says he's going to do. This is what the government wants to do. You go on the other side. All you hear is like 1000 people. More people die, die, die, die. That's all you hear is the numbers. No, you don't have no solution. And the problem is people get fucked up on how they want your solution conveyed to them. It's like, can you give it to me slow?  Joe, can you have Vaseline with it or are you going to be rough with me? And they can't take motherfuckers that my folks can't handle rough. I'm a guy I put like this.  Right. I'm going to a Democrat. Right. And I love being a Democrat until tax season.  You know how close I was to putting to make America great again with my taxes? Yeah, well, the point I make it and I am an example for a lot of people. I'm a small business.  You know, I'm a vet. I'm a veteran, I served the United States Air Force, I did my times and I am not going to say how good of an airman I was, but I committed four years of my life to this country. You know, I'm saying and if there's it is not about let's take away the shit about but the way he made me feel. And then he said, he's such a son. So let's let's take away that in my situation is a lot of people that are I'm a small business and my vet and the things that he do for those type of people is easy for me to say.  I, I, I could justify all I'm thinking about is money and paper and just fucking because of that. But is people the disconnection right now with this election, I feel is that everybody has their use, everybody's taxes on emotions. It's all on how I feel or I like this guy, like that guy, like this guy or whatever. You know, this is like this motherfucker is going to come into this election and just beat the shit out of.  Anybody the economy was doing well, you know what I'm saying, to hold my whole thing was with anybody getting upset. Joe, what are you going to fight this motherfucker with?  You don't have no more fighting styles.  Yeah, well, being pissed there, it's not good for anybody.  It's definitely not good for him. It's not good for them, but.  If that's what sounds like this battle sells the Balcells, this is a you know, when all the dust settles, we're going to reevaluate so many different things about our culture because we're going to realize how temporary the civilization we put together really is, especially if we hit a Great Depression.  After this, we don't bounce back or things get real ugly for a lot of people.  You know, they're going to feel very misled and mismanagement.  I don't think it's but I don't I don't think that that's my personal thing. That's going to be a case like this. Again, not a doctor, professor, but it's more technology involved these days. There's more of a possibility that of making profit off of this. And you know how when you can make money off of something, how people feel about that, just like you just tell me about the test. A situation like, you know, it's like do you have you had like some of I don't even know where to begin.  And the reason we don't know when to begin because. Like this. OK, because what they tell you, what did they tell you? They say don't come up in this motherfucker hospital or whatever unless you feel a little fucked up. Right.  You know, I'm saying like, everybody doesn't have the benefits that you have, you know what I mean? And this is no disrespect to anything. So what happens? How do I. So what they trying to say is I got to be sick before I go. See, that's some people's reality. You know, some people like this. I don't go check, you know, I'm saying. But what this shit is going to switch over. We're going to we're going to switch over, but we're can start having a level of confidence.  And that's going to be because we're going to handle this shit quick.  This is what I think we're going to do to make people understand the money. We need a certain amount of health coverage, four percent for everybody. And this is this is a perfect example that one hundred percent, because the more people get sick from this, the more everyone else is going to get sick to the money.  Because anything, Joe. Like, yes, anything like I keep saying it. I keep saying the thing that's going to enlighten everybody and understand about this is like I know you don't want to get the coffee, but why you try not to get coffee, you stop in a lot of shit. Yes, you stop.  It goes back to you talk about diet and everything. Yeah. And that's why, like, they're like in the black community, like I was hitting hard motherfuckers. Come on, man. Like we talked about this before. Nobody wants to deal with fucking reality. And if you haven't, would be writing your fucking face. The reality is always Al-Fayez Yo.  I think the large number of people that live like that don't know. It's just a symptom of this crazy society. Now that this has been shook up, I think a lot of people are going to reevaluate that and think about the things that are putting them the way, you know, the I believe this to week people are going to get weaker and strong.  But I think something like this week, people get weaker and strong, people get stronger.  It could happen or weak people can figure out that what they're doing could really end their life and that there have been fucking up and they need to step up and then they'll step up now because they realize that this is all due to be weak and you can be weak and smart at the same time.  Sure. There's a lot of people like that that are really intelligent, but they don't have control of their emotions or they don't have control of their discipline. That's real discipline is the number one.  That's a big one. It's a big one. It's what gets things done. It does the thing that gets things done more consistently than anything is.  And nobody is going to ever. Nobody's talking to his mindset, Joe. Why didn't it happen? They're going to be like, oh, yeah, I was young then that. No, but not too many people can say. And it comes down to I wasn't disciplined enough.  That's what's so fucked up about this crisis, is that there's people that were doing the right thing.  They were disciplined and still they get their livelihood taken away from them and then they get their health taken away from them.  They did the right thing. That's what's so crazy. Yeah, that's that's never happened to us before.  And that's what it's so it's not funny, but that's when it comes to a even death, you know, like when somebody you hear about somebody dying and you were close to them or, you know, a story of them or something else. When people die, you hear this right here. Oh, shit. We lost a good one today.  Like the other days we lost those guys. They were good ones. You know, it's like of all these deaths, like this one today, we lost a good one.  Sometimes when someone dies that you're like a fan of like Prince or David Bowie or Bill Withers.  When Bill Withers died real recently, it's like, oh, that live at Carnegie Hall.  I know that guy was that song used me. I mean, come on, man, you have a great song. That song. You are my friend. Yeah. One of us has to say he's sorry. We could never be friends again. I said some things that caused you sorrow. I just want you as my friend. We're here today and gone to.  Oh, wow, none of us knows where life will end. That's all, man, live at Carnegie Hall, and I'll tell you the thing I dug about Bill Withers the most, me being a comedian and loving music, you know, I don't know everything about music, but like if you heard his live album, The Transitions from one song to the next, you would appreciate it if you haven't heard of Joe, the comedic timing of it.  Listening to the crowd, you know, I'm saying like, you know what I mean? Like, the storytelling is like like his little house and the things he was saying was all on point. He he took a crafted suspense to build up the joke and then going back to I loved when he introduced Grandma and he said grandma used to go to church and it wasn't one of them churches where you go and you say, if you love Jesus handsaw.  He said, Now, now, now. He said grandma went to the church where the beat starts getting to you and you get them to the stove, you say, Oh. That was Grandma Church dad, he said, I loved that old lady. I love that old lady. Grandma hands. Oh, oh, oh, if you haven't heard that album in a while and you know it's classic and the thing about Bill Withers, people don't know the young is the millennium's they don't know half the songs, the remakes, whatever happens, they get connected.  It came from him.  Yeah, I imagine I wonder how much come when he was on the Lionel Richie level of royalties or whatever, but ah, this fucking album right here.  How about Lean On Me, Lean Song? You know, I would tell you I use that song as the background theme for my roasting of Charlemagne, the God.  You know, I just want to say I have theme song for this motherfucker, Joe.  Yo yo. I had a few songs some times in my life.  I pray for him. Because a slaughter helps. So why do you guys go at it so hard? I don't understand. You brought it up. I didn't bring it up.  I brought it up earlier. I brought it up about Sinem. I'll explain, Joe. Joe. Joe, listen, this was a day of frustration. OK, I've known this crew for some years, Joe, Angela, you go back 20 years and we go back 15 weeks to do Hot 97 together. Charlamagne we worked at MTV's Geico together, right? It's all love. We know each other. Right. And then I used to go up there.  I'm up there so much because I work at Caroline's on Broadway, you know, that's what you promote it. So I got they started this thing where they want to play pranks on me, right. Like, Oh, we got to let me win.  You know, one prank was when he comes in, no one laughs at his jokes. All right.  Right. This one look, it's like this one of them is like this. Joe, when he comes in, don't laugh at his jokes. Right? So I go in and I try to be funny. I'm just funny and nobody laughing anything. And I'm like, Joe, I'm thinking like this. I'm like, I know. I know. The fix is on. Joe.  Joe, I know you were suspicious. Joe something was wrong.  Joe, have you ever seen me in a room and nobody's laughing? I can't say that. No.  OK, that's pretty much everywhere I go. I'm just being honest.  I know you're funny. I know I'm funny. But not only that, but my energy, even if I'm not putting my energy, is is good. I came in here trying to play it and I'm like, oh, I'm about to tear everybody up in his room. I'm like, I don't hit women but yea I mean it was something, right.  And they were like we told them not to laugh my OK.  Little corny joke three or four other times I got to keep doing these jokes and I'm like stop doing the motherfucking jokes like. I know we're friends, whatever, but at the same time, I do have a resume, I have done stuff, I'll continue to do stuff as much as they want to play.  This is the reality of it. Do you feel like it's disrespectful? No, it's a disrespectful way. Like anything you try to call me. Not funny. You see me stand up 6500 people at Radio City Music Hall. Charlamagne, you said out of your voice that Donelle I went to see Radio City Music Hall, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Daniel perform that night. He said, I love all of them and I take them in. He said with Daniel that night was on, you saw that nigga, you saw all that shit.  So you trying to say you corny, which is allergic, were to a black comedian, you corny like? No, you're trying to give the impression that I'm corny or not funny. It's just a waste of time and it don't make sense. So now that we get a little joke stuff off now give me a real interview. You know, I mean the song. Then I say, give me a real interview, OK?  Did you does he know you feel like this? You have to talk to him off the air. Yeah, we talked about it.  But what I'm saying is. But this is how petty he is, OK? He this is the this is part of the reason why I won't stop.  Because he won't stop. Right. He'll say I was I was by something like this. He said, that's all. I like playing you two sensitive. Right. So we go back, OK, let's go back.  And like we've had the conversation. But what I realized is that it doesn't matter what I say. He's never going to give it, you know, he's never going to do it. So what I have to do is continue to destroy him on the level that I need to destroy him.  The means I'm ruthless, I've seen them and people are like, I thought it was an inside fund joke, though.  I didn't know it was so serious. No, it's serious and it's funny.  OK, Joe, everything is always underlining. Everything is always something underlying.  It's like, nah, we're cool, but so it's never you never feel comfortable saying I like them. And the reason I like we have fun together, I have said. To him, you know why I said, I know why you think you're a sex symbol and you look good. I say because I was in South Carolina this weekend, right?  And I said, you are the best looking person in South Carolina. You should feel like a king. We fuck with each other, but also know his radio background. I'll never take this away from. This is where we differ. His radio background is coming from South Carolina. You know how it is getting radio break going from Mark like South Carolina to New York. New York is the number one radio market period. You go from that from a P.A. or intern, whatever entry level position that you go from that and you build and you in your country, motherfucker, you are country motherfucker.  And you and now you're Charlamagne and God, he works hard.  And he does a podcast with Andrew Schultz, too. Yeah, they do it. What does that brilliant idea. It's a very good podcast and I'm a I'm a person of this two of them together.  They are great. I'm a person like this. Joe, if you're doing it. I can't hate on that. You're doing it. You do a really good job and you you're doing late night and all that type of shit. I respect that. But it stop with the same. You can't allow me. You can't call me, I'm not a you you can't call me, you're giving people answers for Christmas presents. Giving people access you didn't notice, Joe, no excuses, Joe, you didn't notice, I didn't know.  What the fuck are you doing, man? Just busy doing other stuff.  Oh yeah. We went to this again, right? I did, yeah. We went to this was sixty two. I'm sorry, but this is definitely like giving a fake ass a fake. Now you OK. Can I play in the scenario before you see this video. OK. Right. And I'm not trying to say anybody's game, but sometimes people have real comfortable, comfortable, real comfortable.  OK, if Jamie were to come in here like this and be like, oh, Joe, good to see you, man. I haven't seen you since, Howie, I got a gift for you. Be like, thanks, Jamie. That's nice. You open the box and you open up us and you open it. And then as Jamie gave you this as a gift, OK, here we go.  It's open it. Let's see. What is this? Now, this is friends like that is a rubber ass. What is that look, Joe.  Oh, we made a mold of his ass, right? Oh, OK. That's funny that. It's kind of funny, but how long for a little bit if how long, like just as we have been going maybe goes to put his finger in the booty hole?  Well, you know, you do what you got to do. You want to get the fuck you talking about, man. I don't care, really. OK. All right. All right. You're comfortable. You would be comfortable. Black ass black as well.  We'll get the ball rolling by the balls. What the fuck? Maybe this is the wrong show.  So is it would you do that? An exact mold.  You just like give him a picture to see. That's important. See, like you parents don't do that. Here it is. You know that. That's what they do. Guess what, Joe? And this is what I try to tell you. Really appreciate it. That's why. Boy humor right there. You love that joke. Some of you were saying it's not. I'm not going to lie to you. It's not my favorite thing. That's a favorite thing.  But that's a humor you can respect.  I guess that's what that's what you tend to be like. Dude, I t back to my whole life there. I have never done that.  But what they're doing is look, that's unnecessary. Exactly. Unnecessary and rude. And it's OK. And no one likes it like that anyway. Oh my God.  Oh my God. This is the up. That's the thing that with porn stars man they get paid to get like molds of their body and then do.  So you're trying to say Charlemagne is a porn star. That's how they make those. That's a reason why there's a hole. OK, Joe, I don't know how the fuck they made that one, but don't bring it to my interview and don't keep putting it in my fucking face. Is that fair?  Dunno. Just think about this.  Why is there a hole here if it's a mold of your ass? The only reason why there's a hole is they put it there. They put a place where you can stick something in the Joe thing. And I'm making Joe is that that's not what you give your man. I understand. I just I'm just saying, you know, I know you're going to know how to break it down the hole, everything to do it. And I wouldn't do that type shit.  That's not what I'm saying. And then would you be sketchy of a guy and then what are you going to fill it up with? Cream. What is that? The portion that lotion.  Look, look, that's D.J. N.V.. He got a family, Joe. He's got a family job. No, he's got a family and a dope son is like in with a great father. This is one family there. Go for it once. You already got the party rolling your finger in a rubber. But why not one man? Why in the world with cocoa butter?  I'm not. I'm not mad. I'm not mad. So you don't think you don't. OK, now, ok, I wouldn't want that. So I wouldn't. Here's the thing. I wouldn't want someone to give me that. I wouldn't want to be there. I wouldn't want to have to deal with it when I don't want to be around to take them off.  Because if think they want to be finger in it. No, I don't know.  Down now you understand them. I understand. The point I'm making is that I know that's your thing. The booty stuff. You guys have fun, you know, like your y'all have fun doing it.  I'm not of that place or space.  You're not into finger and rubber, but not on people on camera.  And then they went back and forth, son, they went back and forth that keep doing it. And the last time I went up there, I knew I already knew there was going to do this to try to choke, you know, those horns they take to soccer matches? Spanish Yeah.  I went to the Breakfast Club with a bag full of the motherfuckers. And every time he says, I'm driving like this, hey, Jesus, I shut him down.  He couldn't talk. Right. I'm shaking it like I'm like this. I got to like this to free on his freezing my hand.  Right, I'm shaking and my shit went dead. Then he said, yeah, man, fuck, you ain't got no spray. I went right my badge out and I got another click.  I knew you would like that part more than anything. I clipped up on his ass. I was using windage. You know what windage is on the gun right there.  And I tore his ass up and I was smoking then. I still want to do the jobs. They still want to do the jobs. Didn't like this job. They won't stop Jolies. Niggers won't stop Joe. They still won't stop. Right. These motherfuckers won't stop telling you joke. So now they're like, oh, yeah, your interview is over. We're going to leave guys. They get up and leave you there and leave me there. That's a joke, which you do take over the radio show, Joe.  And I would imagine it was about to go down. They say, well, I was like, the fuck out of here, Angela. Yea, that's my girl. We stayed. Angela, you said they said you go and Anjali's I know I'm a stay. They left the room, me and Leon and now the interview. I kind of wanted them to give me the stories, interview, whatever me and Angela I clicked right into to interview them off of his back.  Hey what are you doing. I'm like, no, no, you're gonna go. And I keep on fucking with me, Joe. You know, I'm sensitive, Joe, you know how sensitive, Joe I know Joe. You know the look on your face.  They keep on fucking with me, Joe.  Joe and I keep saying it's going to be like talking. I ain't going to jail fucking the motherfuckers. I can tell you that shit is not going to be. But now it's like it's funny. Every time I got an opportunity, it's so much fun.  Let me show you. I got to just show you. This is I have an arsenal. I have an arsenal. Just how long bearded humor be making these joints look holla holla bearded Zuma. Yeah, that's my God.  Look at these headline beauty humor. He's so dope. Looking at you. Did you know this story?  Jussie Smollett allegedly had sex with his attacker at Chicago Bathhouse. And then it's him and it's Jesse.  Who else? It looks like you Photoshop Charlemagne's in Photoshop, Charlamagne Shit that was him sent the same terrible Photoshop that Jamie That's not a terrible Magga hat on. You got the message, you got the business.  That's the type of venom I'll continue. He's probably thinking that's funny. He does. That's hilarious. How can you not how could you know. Because I don't want. Yeah but I will say people x the thing about everywhere I go, people like yo the Breakfast Club baby be fucking with you Sunday.  Be fucking what you sign.  So I just wonder, do you think there's a way to do a show like within the next month.  Where are you going to test everybody. Are you going to produce it.  No, no, no. I mean like a comedy show because the last time you said you was going to and I'm not I'm the last time you said you mean podcast. Yeah. Last time you said no. That's not what you said. No, no, no.  What you tried to force me to doing was just doing.  I feel like he did. Jamie, did I force him into anything? Jamie, I know I'm not saying I'm not trying. It's just but I can't blow you up. But you you said I didn't force you said you was producing the first episode. I said I would do it. I said our producer Jamie was not excited about it at all. He wouldn't even take the shit off my phone.  But Jamie was doing something with you right now. He didn't it wasn't he didn't do it on the issue. I was trying to I was trying to blue to I was trying to airdrop the episode that I did in a car.  So Jamie was producing it. So he said, you know, he started not taking my calls also. Is that what happens? Yo. But what a shame it is.  You want something? Definitely we did. Jamie, how did you get off the ground? All right. One hundred percent. That's why I can't take this. What do you put it up for me? Upload it.  If no, we got he sent me the video and then we got the video and then a whole bunch of stuff happened that day, like including the podcast that we're supposed to get a song from Rozsa, which you got, I think, right.  Yeah. Yeah.  It's got to be you never said it to me. The beat. How was I supposed to put it on that video. I didn't know you was.  Well, um, so I we we felt like this was going to be more work than we anticipated.  I knew it. I knew it. I knew Jamie didn't want to do it. So he showed me some things that I mean, that kind of stuff where he's got to figure out how to put the bead on the you know, if I don't know why you guys didn't communicate properly.  We did. He wasn't flama with me, Joe. Joe, he wasn't fucking with me. Joe believe that when I walked to the Chinese that he always responds.  What happened, Jamie? I don't want to say it on air.  Oh, that's I remind you guys off air. Well, he doesn't call you out. We all know when I went over there, Jamie started breathing hard.  When I went over, he was like he was just what you said, Jamie, I'm telling you, you said you looked and looked at that little scroller. You do like this. Your eyes blink, bro. You did. I just you said it's not it's going to take too long. All right. Here's what happened.  I was remembering it again, OK, in the middle of we had we finished your podcast and we started the next one with Reza. I have to do stuff in the middle of doing two podcast. That's what I did know during that. You came up to me and started not making me, but asking me to help you write. I had to get the next podcast ready and I had no idea. At the same time you were I was trying to communicate with you how to use airdrop and you weren't on the wi fi, were on the Bluetooth.  And that's the best way to get the video to me. We were trying to figure out if you could do that or a drop off.  So, Jamie, you didn't hear me say this. You didn't hear me say this. Jamie, this part of the story, you didn't hear me say this. Jamie, Jamie, I don't want to upset you. What do I need to do to make this situation easier for you? I never said that. We got we got that part figured out, though. Yeah, but that was the first thing. But see, I didn't know the urgency of I'm just here because my narcissistic attitude, I was all I was thinking about me and I didn't think about you had another show.  So you understand, right?  I feel I contacted Jamie and Jamie told me that you got somebody else to do it then. Like who got David's opening, all right.  Yeah, I did it because somebody wouldn't answer my fucking phone calls me. OK, all right. It got done. But here's the thing. And I'm happy you're up and running. That's what I'm saying. Like, I could never be mad at that situation because that was the kick in the ass for me to do it. You know, I'm saying I like the fact that, like that day, it was it was the birth of it. You know, I'm saying, like, that day was so special to me, you know?  I mean, I didn't want to be at risk because I told you I was like, I just got to flight. Haven't seen my son in a while. Right. I said I was like, fuck you. Was like I was like a nigger. I said, Yeah, that's good. I said, Yeah, but my son I see my son, I got a red eye. Right. And remember that. And I was like, right before before I was going to leave, you asked me you you said you sure.  I was like, nigga, go see my son. Right. I love Will Tank but I got to see my son and I walk out the door. I'm about to leave. I'm Dipen in the car.  Fucking Rizza pull up. And the first thing he said was, what's up?  And she Larry, you funny motherfucker. I know.  I said, man, fuck my son, nigga, that will take forever. My son don't even look like me, nigga. I'm good.  They got to rub the shit out of this.  That's what happened. So it was if I was out of pocket, I'ma tell you, because I would I would have never been a no show like you better do this. I was nigga. Anybody America. You understand Joe Rogen and James say they produced my first podcast. Rezac come through the fucking door saying I'm a give you a track.  That's a lot of things that happened in a day. That's a lifetime, motherfucker. Joe Rocker just endorsed my shit. Jamie said that came in Bongbong trying to be a comedian. And he said he's going to give me a beat. I was like, man, when we went air pockets, I was on fucking Cloud9 bra.  When you do your podcast, what are you doing it twice a week? How many days a week? I do it. It all depends. Like twice. Twice I do one one.  Sometimes I do two. Sometimes I do. It all depends on how I feel. I think I can but I feel like doing. Yeah that's nice. Yeah. I love it.  I'm telling you whenever you feel it. Majerle amateurism from that day I will be forever grateful for that conversation, you know, because it put me on a path of like, like everybody. Everybody to start this business. They want to be you, they want to be you when they start, they don't look at the steps. They don't look at the steps. The only thing they see is you. Now, you got some loyal fans. But when it comes to being somebody being introduced to the game or whatever, you're the grill.  You're like, I want a nigga. You can't just do that motherfucker. You got to fight for that shit. You got to go through a whole bunch. You can't do that. But what you could say is like, I want to have the work ethics of that motherfucker have that.  So that's everything that's about doing it. And if you you keep doing that, you get better at it.  That's when I started when I was you said I was sensitive because I didn't know that I'm not in control of the podcast world. I'm in control of a stage. Yeah. If I go on a stage, nigga, you come at me, I'ma tell you as you come to me, what the trolly shit or whatever, I don't know. I to some new shit. And then when I first started doing it, I'd never promise anything, anything, anybody crazy.  I was like, it's going to evolve.  And even the people that work when I said, listen man, it's a learning process, I said, but every week we got to grow every we got to be some different if we have our sound was kind of shaky the week before next week.  We can have that sound issue. Of course, we're going to make mistakes, but we can't repeat the same mistakes. That's when it gets to be a nuisance. Let's grow. Let's go. In terms of the mike, the posters, everything.  Yeah, it's it's like everything else. But it's more more you think about it more you can improve it. The more you think about what you did that maybe you could have done better.  It's not ever done like I have a bad podcast to this day.  Sometimes it just doesn't click off or my brain is on fire in that good.  It's going to happen but a way around it. But if they dig, you tune in to find out.  Well, they they kind of tell someone listens to you for so many hours, they kind of get it just like there's some days, like any other human being, there's some days like physically you don't feel as good as you feel. Other days you want you run down. Your brain doesn't work that way or well, that rather that way either when you run down your brain doesn't work.  Well, it's like sometimes I'm just not as sharp or sloppy or maybe I'm not as enthusiastic as I should be, maybe not tuned in as much like it's all about being tuned in.  Man, I, I've had some and it's so funny because every time I do an episode right. I'm like this, you know, when I get on stage I don't know when I report. Yeah. You're like, oh yeah, I do a podcast and I'm like, oh I'm like, did anybody see the scorecard. Right. I'm like like I'd like to go. I'm like, yeah, not, you know, how to move like this.  Are you like this is like it's still like. Well yeah.  And but for some reason those moments I'm like, oh I don't know because it's half I can't be critical of myself when I'm talking. It's hard man. You know, I got to, I can't think. But the times I thought it was going to be like whatever was some of the best, it felt good. It felt really good. And it's I feel good from nobody. Everybody talks about. You want to reciprocate that much. Forgive me for Beechboro.  And I didn't cut this beat up into all type of shit. So I got commercials. I guess I got to remix this one. Fucking beat it.  So don't you see the thing with him and D.J. Premier? Yeah, I was I was in and out of it.  How interesting is that? It's interesting.  It's a great way to, like, make something out of all this.  But you know what, Joe? I'm glad you brought that up. Right, because that's the new thing. Everything is the versus thing now, Joe, the battle and then people like even with that, with people are like this. They said, who won?  And in a battle like that, everybody won. Everybody won. Everybody won. But you also people won because you're watching it while it's happening.  And these guys are having a good time knowing that all these people getting into it online and it's all going down on your phone. So it's all everything is a completely new thing from top to bottom. The is completely new. The fact that Rizza and Premiere dude, I'm a huge gangster fan. I love gangster from a long time ago.  That's like real rap. And that's what was so dope about this. And this is the point I was trying to make on the joint I was talking about.  Like, one of the things that I'm impressed about, and I know people like this, you didn't ever talk or whatever, but I felt like my friends say the same same shit, same same shit, and it was his voice to say it. But I'm like, anything else. Do we know about and I'm more impressed on being able to create a group as iconic as Wootten is. That's it. And be able to say, you know what, I'm not saying it was the strife or anything is like I'm a bad motherfucker.  I can flip genres, I can do whatever I'm sure another white writing style. So that's one of the things that I personally respected about him and his journey.  They built one of the most iconic bands in all of music because they're did.  Or what did you tell me? Fish or no fish is a copy of the Grateful Dead. They would have.  I mean, when I say that a band back into it forever. Yeah, forever.  There's some, but there's something about them. It's like what they stand for is, you know, that expression that the sum is greater than its parts. So like you counted up all them together.  You're right. We are all together. They just.  I'll be right back. All right. All right. We'll drop them off. It's like, oh, I'm good.  They were all so original, too. And, you know, and ODP when Oddbins went big, that was a part of their master plan, though, right?  Well, yeah. When he was when he was doing that. Baby, I got your money song. Come on, man. It's still on this day when you hear that song. That's one of my all time favorite songs. That's a happy song.  But yeah, I got your money and he was like, you know. Oh, ODP was. Oh, Debbie. Yeah. Like, I'm the only thing that I liked about what your fans say inside that nickname they gave me because they would give me would take things that they said. Right. They called me the old dirty interrupter. Right. And I was like this. I had to give a thumbs up on that one said they call me the old dirty interruptive and they're serious.  And the thing about it was that she dirty interrupted. It blew up so much. Risa. Hit us up. They were doing a 25 year loud, loud, loud, 25 year loud record anniversary at Radio City Music Hall, hutting Copwatch groups right and resident reached out to us and he wanted us to do a video to introduce the Wu Tang stage. Me and Dave was we were me and Dave, we were touring, we were somewhere and we did a video and they played at Radio City Music Hall and everybody was like, yo, Dave is like, yo, what's up?  Radio City music? Do you see me coming? Let me say something.  Did you ever see it? No. Oh, man. It was a great ass moment, man. And as much as people want to shit on me about, he ruined the podcast just and I know most of it was the energy Dave had, but that little connection came through. I was like, you motherfuckers then woke up a beast.  You know, you have to be so mad it make you go do something. Man, I have seen this video. I have seen it. Yeah, it's like a selfie camera. Yes, a selfie camera. Yeah. OK, yeah. Yeah, yeah, that's right. You know, and they played that while the concert was going on.  And then then it was like, man, it was fire. You know that.  I know I didn't even make page six or whatever, but it was like to know that.  That is a part of my life, you know, I'm saying those relationships, it was it's just fucking dope, man. Like. They gave me a beatnik. Come on, man, it's pretty impressive, yo, but yo, Risa gave me a beat shuttle to my whole crew.  Julius And that's what you use for the podcast Open. All right. Yeah, but it's like that intros. I did like Kopans, but and I don't want to be like overly producer anything, but I have established something with the intros where I think people kind of look forward to like how does a play not knowing what you know.  Yeah, for sure. It's just that you're just able to express yourself so easily there. When you do something like that where no one has any input, it's just you to them.  It's like you're basically doing a lot of what you do when you do radio shows anyway. He just do it to the whole world. Yeah, yeah. It's just you rant for the whole world and you don't know.  The hardest part is like you don't know they're listening. You got to where that's true. You got to wait for a responsible stage. You knew that it was wack or not. Yeah. It's a it's just a different thing, but it's a different thing to focus on.  It's been fun. It's been so dope and now it's like with the covid-19 and everything is like I really have time to put into and I'm having I'm really I'm really having fun doing it.  It's fun. That's beautiful, man. It's it is all about finding something to occupy your time that you enjoy. That's a big part of what life's all about. But I'm hoping this does too for people. Once the dust settles and the economy starts to bounce back, I'm hoping people when they go forward, they're going to make choices based on what they want to do, what they really want, what they really are excited by, what they're going to enjoy, not on what they think is the safest, the safest option, not best long term.  They have to now because they fill in what's important. Yeah, the fear they have to they fill in it.  So it's like, what do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? Why is that me? What does it do?  Why did you when you do an impression of me, why do you say what do you what do we do?  Because everything is not all the time, but we know what do we do. But just what do we do? It's like a movement. What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? What do we do? And why are you what are we doing?  You're telling us what we need to do, but you still say what do we what do we do? Because I'm never sure. But you don't you sound like and that's you sound like you write about everything you don't know to me. My focus is sound like that.  I definitely don't sound like I'm right about everything. I'm wrong about a lot of shit. But I'm right about what you don't sound like. I'm right about what I think in that I know this is how I think I'm pure in my intention. I'm not always correct. What do we do?  What do we do? What do we do? What do we do with intentions? What do we do with attention?  What do we do? We ignore do we ignore it? What do we do? Don't get sucked in your phone, baby.  Don't get some comments. Don't do it. Just time. You can never get back. That's important. It's time we can never go back. You're too creative.  You're doing too much good shit. Doing too much fun shit that that you posted up on the Instagram the other day. I love that bit about how women love text messages because there's no way you would ever let them say that many words to your face.  No, sir. You would not do it by first paragraph. It's like not today, bitch, not today. You got to save this for somebody else.  Yeah, well, they're giving you this fucking one, two, three, four, five, six pages in a row. Jeez, shut the fuck up.  How many text messages are coming? Are we read into each other here and then.  Sorry, Jimmy, but they're all stacked up. And did you hit a fucking loser self like the Warriors is above any whatever it was that so passive aggressive, you don't even. Right.  OK, it's just it's like I don't want to hear it. It's like.  It's like it's like a place you can kind of get away with k you can kind of get away with OK. But if you're like like, you know, people write a bunch of k's like if you do that that's like you're like dismissing them.  Right.  Like ok, ok, ok, ok. But you can never stop it. Three KS No. Three.  I got to go to floor if you like, if you just like that message now instead of hitting cave and if you just liked it.  Yeah. To that girl back is like that's weird man. Girls get upset. It's like passing out. I feel like girls want, they want you to write it back.  OK. Sounds good. Thank you. Bye. They want you to say it back. Jamie. Nah man. Just fucking like it thing because what if they have Android.  It says it's a text message to them that says you like this weird fucking confusing.  I like it. I just thumbs up because I don't have no middle options. That's how they keep us divided. Yeah. Edwards is right. Android and Apple. That's how they keep us divided. That's the separation.  That's a real man. Yeah. Kind of an air drop me. I got that.  Well is that we good weed. Right. That shit was up. I never had that speed weed.  So this is all speed weeds blunts. They're called loaded. Shout out to my man Gino know made that belt.  I think he's always got the belt. He has a literally a bandolier like Clint Eastwood in an old western.  Well there's these cartridges of blunts all around him.  Yeah. Malarious you going to keep that on now, just like it's in less than half an hour.  We're going to find out whether or not you got the covid contact wrona. I wish we'd done it before. I don't know. Well, let everybody know how you feel. You feel good. I feel great.  That's the thing. That's the thing that like. That's the thing, is gonna freak my fingers out like a motherfucker could feel great and not be great. You don't know. Yes, you know, that's what's scary about this disease is more than any other one, how many people test positive but don't experience any symptoms and then other people just die. It's like it is confusing for folks.  I think they said there's some the number was between 50 and 70 percent. Right. They they test positive. They've come in contact with the virus. They have no symptoms at all. When do you think we're going to get back to normal?  I don't think, again, Joe is never going to be another normal at this. Is it? Now that this is it? I just think that people are going to build a different match.  If you graduate in high school and this is what happens. Is the world you looking forward to, motherfucker?  Right when I get out or another thing you can think of, like I was talking with my buddies and I've been having a really good time with my son making stuff. He said, man, I know this may sound crazy, but just Corona's shit. He said, you and your son don't look back. One day you're going to be like a dad. Remember when we made that Slingshot Donat when a Corona was out?  Yeah, you know, I'm saying it's like it it's like, you know, the memory is going to be there all type of ways.  Yeah. You're building memories that you wouldn't have ordinarily built. Yeah.  As long as you're alive and as long as you're healthy, it's just it's I think the positive side of this, you can always look at the negative side, but the positive side is look how many people are complying.  Look how many people are doing the right thing. Right. That's a lot of people, a lot of people.  And they're doing the right thing because they care about their loved ones and people hopefully they care about your loved ones.  And people aren't complaining as much. People not they're like, well, I mean, some people are hurting financially.  A lot of people are losing their businesses. They're hurting. But the amount of stress, the amount that you see in the streets as far as like riots and protests, it's non-existent. People are understanding we're all fucked. This is like we didn't see it coming. We all got a deal.  I just hope this makes people realize that all that pull them up by their bootstraps stuff. Like people love to think that that's how people should be. You know, you should just pull yourself up by your bootstraps, go out there and fucking make something for yourself. That's all true. You definitely should go out there and try to accomplish some goals. But there's going to be times in our lives as a community where some shit goes down.  It's not anybody's fault, but they need help. And that's when we have to evaluate what our taxes go to.  Because if our taxes don't go to some form of excellent, very accessible health care and making that more widespread, then you're basically saying you don't really care about people's health and their survival as much as you care about money. Now, if we're going to commit to that kind of a culture after something like this, well, we're insane. We're not learning anything. We should learn something from this. What we can learn from this is like health wise, we're not prepared, whether it's through hospital beds, excuse use, ventilators, social distancing protocols, whatever the fuck it was.  We weren't prepared for something like this. But now that we are, we should all go.  Hey, yeah. You know what, man? No one should not have the money to pay for treatment for this.  So what do we do? What do we do, Joe? What do we do? What do we change?  The way we look at our services, it sounds like you said we've got to change thinking, period, change thinking, but also change what our money should go to.  Our money's got to go to that. It's got to go to that. But that's very important for everybody.  When people get sick, it spreads to all of us. Now, we also we don't want ever to know anyone that you love that's going to die because they can't get health care that's available for people that have money that we've got to stop that, just like we stop with fire department.  The fire department is on fire because they're worried. Hold on a second. Fire department goes to a house when it's on fire because not just to that house, they don't want to spread through the whole city. They go, well, that's the same thing with health care. If someone's really sick, they don't help you and you got coronavirus, you spread it to everybody else. Right? You don't get the health care. So and you you're contagious.  It's almost like a fire and a lot of ways like a viral fire.  But aren't we living in a system where everybody is qualified to have health care? We should be. We should. So what is what is Covered California? What the fuck is that all about?  I don't know, man.  I don't I mean, if you think about how much money gets spent on things, right, whether it's computers, whether it's cars, whether it's houses, whether it's whether the things that people buy, how much of a percentage of that, if you could escalate it just a little bit and all of that money goes into just health care, not just taxes where no one's accountable.  You don't know where the fuck it's going to go. What if everybody's dollar cost a dollar five, just an added five cents for most things? You buy up to a certain point all that. He goes straight to health care. Wouldn't you be willing to pay instead of a dollar, a dollar five for something if you knew that five cents is going to go towards health care?  That's, you know, as a business person, that five cent may mean a lot to me as a business. You're right. It might say that's it.  That might be. I can't no. Look, know that dollar bill and five, that's only five cents. Now, if you talk about that being billions and millions, then up to switch it up to a certain point up to a certain amount of money.  Right. I mean, after a while with you. Yeah.  It seems like it would be better for everybody and it would be better for us to not worry about what happens if you get sick because you don't know if you're going to be able to pay for it.  Sometimes people get hit with crazy medical bills after, you know, an unexpected injury or unexpected disease time in the hospital.  They've got a huge bill they can't fucking pay. It's real common they could go bankrupt because of that kind of shit.  And if you're entitled to, you've got to go get it. I just man this whole conversation. So just. Oh, I don't even know. That's a word. It's just. Yeah, OK, will you go back and forth with it? But I think that if the only thing we can do is like we must agree, there's no there's no going back to normal.  Well, not until they come up the vaccine and then even normal, then it's going to be normal that we realize that this happened and want to say vaccine approach.  It's not that I'm saying we've got to take the first vaccine that comes down to don't worry about the microchip, not let's not get crazy. I'm saying the treatment, medicine something the cures for a disease, just like they've cured every other disease.  They just like just like they've come up with treatments for polio or smallpox or all the other fucking disease. Leave it to the medical scientists, leave it to these people that study this shit. They're going to try to figure something out once they do whatever it is, if they can. And once they do, then I hope we ease back into what what life used to be like, but with an added knowing until this shit can go down. Right.  But until it till then, the mask, not the day. Rohnert Oh, are you nervous? Are you nervous about the future.  Oh, good. Beautiful. I don't think I could be the best of me. You definitely not the best to you with the mask on. So take that off. I know.  I got to give it to me. Twenty minutes and twenty minutes. You got to get tested. All right. So I did a service. I'm telling you to just like this. When you think about it's like. You don't even know a motherfucker didn't know they got a test. Yeah, you know, I'm saying it's like.  And I know that that's that's definitely the direction we're going in, because on the news I've been saying I'm like testing stations, testing stations, but I don't know if everybody knows what's the system.  And then for what I hear on the news, whatever, don't go to the hospital. Don't go. But I guess going to hospital testing is different.  Don't do this unless you are feeling symptoms of feeling bad, you know.  Yeah. I read this one article that this doctor was telling people. There's so many people that come that don't have it, but then they go to the hospital in the waiting room and then they get it in there.  It's like if you you know, there's people that have the flu and they don't have coronavirus, but then they go and then they get the coronavirus at the hospital while they're waiting around to find out if they got coronavirus which going have a broken leg down, trying to go to the hospital right now.  I know it's my friends and he goes, I'm not going to hospital for a year. I was like, really? That there is still one of my friends is in the hospital. And somebody told me, husband, I may have fucked that my leg could be broke.  Fuck that. Yup. God damn it, we're going to get there, Joe. I think we're going to get there. I think I think we're going to figure this out. You know, it's going to be a tragedy for a lot of us. It's going to be bad for business.  It's going to be bad for restaurants and comedy clubs and everything else. But at the end, I think we're going to emerge with a better understanding of the temporary nature of life, of love, of our society, and hopefully will be just core to each other. That's that's what I'm hoping. Like when when I said I was into Bernie Sanders, what I'm into is someone that wants to look out for people that aren't doing as well and that that this is something that we should.  You don't think about voting. No, no. You don't fuck with Biden. That's what he said. He said you don't fucking Biden. It's only somebody ask him about Biden. And so I didn't know if he was fucking Biden or not.  I think he's in some sort of a state of cognitive decline. And it's not my opinion. It's a very common opinion. It's not just my opinion. It's you watch videos of him. He's stammering. He doesn't know what he's talking about and they're trying to ignore it. And they would never ignore it if it was anybody else that they didn't agree with or they didn't enjoy. And you watch the the fact that they're not concerned that these people that are on these left wing media shows aren't talking about this and about how important this is.  And the only people that are talking about it are people that are on these Internet politics.  So, yeah, but they're talking about and bringing it up, obviously not being open. But Fox just wants one to win. They just want to win. They're worried about some important things.  They're worried about the Supreme Court, the rate about environmental laws. You know, he's relaxed a lot of environmental laws that they feel that should never be relaxed. And then going into the second term, he's going to do even more crazy shit.  You know, there was something that just came out today, James, see if you can find that it was lowering the it was for certain toxins that get released into the environment and mercury lowering the standards.  So it was some huge issue with see if you could find it.  It was something it was something about lowering the standards for mercury and other toxins to get released, I think from factories, which is like, whoa, what are we you know, if that's what we're doing, are we really going to separate?  Separate? That was Biden's platform. Oh, this is Trump. This is Trump. This is the Trump administration. The current administration did this. And what does it say behind the Washington Post paywall?  But it says the Shinjiro for real, cutting mercury pollution. This is February 17th.  It wasn't like, oh, no, this is a new article that was out just yesterday that I was reading that was talking about lowering the standards it was talking about in the middle of this coronavirus lockdown. They're lowering the standards for mercury and some of the toxins that's, I don't know, no standards.  I didn't know three we had three hours ago EPA gutting rule credited with coal plant. Toxic air clean up. Yeah, see, fuck that.  What did that black dude do, man?  He covered somebody's catfish to female on Snapchat to me.  Rob Well, please go to get involved live.  Look at this shit. Go back to that. Hold on. OK, sorry. No, no, no. Just let me read the title. They gutted the rule credited with coal plant toxic air cleaner clean up. How the fuck did they sell that to anybody? Hey, I got an idea. You know, that shit that we did that would cause the earth to be healthier. Yeah, fuck that.  Right. Let's go back let's go back to burning mercury.  Obama era rule, the Trump administration is gutting an Obama era rule that compelled coal plants to cut back emissions of mercury and other human health hazards, limiting future regulation of air pollutants by petroleum and coal plants.  That's just crazy. Yeah, that anybody would say yes to that.  Anybody would say that's one thing that we get to see is our impact on the environment right now. Because if you look around at the pictures of Los Angeles from just two months ago versus now in terms of how much smog is there, that's a wake up call.  I want to know what the I did man Cephus someone and rob them. That's what I mean.  How did he get away with it? He didn't. That's why his pictures in the newspaper.  All right. I didn't mean to interrupt, but I just I got to say to black dude, I know you do the EPA. I was like, what the fuck did he do?  Stupid Florida. He did in Florida. Goddamn Florida. We're done out.  So it looks like we're supposed to do those dates in September. No, really? Yeah, supposedly. Yeah. It's supposed to be September 4th and 5th.  I saw that. But you know what? Right now it hasn't hit it because the dates that I had of my book, I'm just right now, I've been lucky enough right now to keep them on my calendar and just move them.  Yeah. So it looks like we're hoping we move them. Right.  The next time you really feel comfortable thinking it's OK, it's probably like fall, right.  Hey, was that thing that I said about the Spanish flu, is that true? Because we couldn't find the meme. It wasn't on Charlemagne's page was on someone else. Yeah.  All the other shows on Charlamagne page, the one about just spreading it. Yeah. I just wanted to know if that was true.  So the idea was that they were they they were tired, they were celebrating the war and they were they broke the public distancing. So they had this is in 1918 and then it start the second phase.  And what was the meme that I read said that it killed the second phase of the flu, killed more people than the war did worldwide.  I flew storeyed out, man.  I'm too you know, once we go back, oh, my God, it's going to be nothing but Corona jokes.  Corona jokes are going to be they're going to do a flip. You got to do some different.  This it's going to be so hard if you go on stage after three dudes, they're all going to talk about the coronaviruses. They don't talk about current events. But then how could you not talk about the groover?  I can't I, I don't like the way I want to fight. But, you know, I'm saying, like, my no gets first crack is he almost died.  Yeah. We should probably have a moratorium.  And I don't know, I guess it's great because I know we're going to find out in twelve minutes. I got to go to bathroom. But go ahead. Go ahead. Let's wrap it up. Let's wrap it up. Would you.  I said it's I don't know if it was exactly the way it was. Explained it to me. I'll just leave it at that.  OK, close enough and but I understand.
