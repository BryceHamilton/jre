A great friend, one of the best comedians I know, a hilarious and original person and one of my favorite guests in the podcast, please give it up for the great and powerful Tim Dillon government podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience train my day job and podcast my night all day.  I'm here with the coffee kid covid kid. Baby, you're free. Free. You covered. Free antibodies are negative.  Are you worried you're traveling some risky circumstances?  Yeah, well, a lot of these clubs that you work are they're pretty full and pretty full.  I've been looking at those lines outside the club. I'm like, yeah, how big is this place? Where are you going to socially distance all these people?  It doesn't seem it doesn't seem that socially distant, but at all, I don't know. But we also don't know nobody you know, I.  Is it airborne? Can you get it. Yes, it is er 100 percent. Well that's not great.  No you definitely can get it from the air. But here's the thing man. It's, this is so politicized, it's been so politicized. If you look at the numbers of deaths, the numbers of deaths are way down. They're talking about the numbers of what cases are up. Right. But the deaths are way down.  Yeah, they're much better at treating it. Yeah, way better. But also it's like people are better at taking care of themselves. They're going to go out and do things, too. They understand. You've got to say most people are aware of vitamin D now I take it every day.  Five thousand years ago, a lot of you aware of zinc, a lot of you wear a vitamin C and a lot of people are also that are high risk. They're not going.  Yeah, I mean, sometimes you look at people in the clubs, like I look at some members of my audience, I'm like, you shouldn't be here.  You're taking you're taking way too big of a risk for a few haha. Yeah, but I'm happy about the ticket and thanks for coming but I'm like just looking at them going I wouldn't be in that chair if I were you, but you've got to make your mind up so maybe you have to.  I would I think if I was locked up for six months and I couldn't go out and then one of my favorite comics is in town. Let's go out.  Let's go out. Let's go do it.  When you get tickets like you come in. Yeah, we got to be obviously you want to avoid getting it.  But there's a level of fatalism where you have to say, listen, yeah, you know, there's no guarantee you could walk out of your house and encounter any number of things that could kill you.  Well, Florida just said, fuck it, they just fuck it. We're opening up for every city, everything, concerts, everything you could do, like arenas.  They were closed down for that long. Not that they closed down for a few weeks long enough. Yeah, they were like, that's enough. Everyone sobered up. That was just a hangover. Everybody got sober in Florida. They sobered up. And let's get back at it.  Disney World's been open forever. Disneyland in L.A. is still closed. They're about to go bankrupt. Yeah, Disney World. Come on. And where I'm asking, asshole, go fuck.  Yeah, who cares? I don't care. I just come in. Be careful. Don't get eaten by an alligator. Yeah. You might get eaten by an alligator or you might get a cough.  Right.  Or you might get a cold. Yeah. It seems like we're trending in the direction of things opening up.  Listen, I got to give people freedom. This the government was never supposed to have the ability to tell you what you can and can't do in terms of like what's risky.  The argument against that is that you're putting other people in danger at this point in time. We're six months into this fucking thing. You got to peel the Band-Aid off. You've got to do something. You can't you can't just allow people to go bankrupt. I never, never be able to work.  Well, it's also like Thomas told The Economist said, he's like, there are no one of my favorite quotes because there's no solutions. There's only trade offs.  So you're it's a trade off.  Right? So if you tell everyone, yes, you might keep some people healthy, but at what level of damage to the economy, to people's livelihoods? Suicide is up. Child abuse is job. There's all kinds of problems that come from a lockdown.  Yeah, it's way up. Suicides way up. That's crazy. Yeah, suicide, child abuse. And that shocked me. The child abuse was because I was like who?  I thought child abuse was like a fixed thing. Meaning if you hit your kids, you just hit your kids.  No, I think people react to heavy stress time. I mean, how many people are just broke and don't know what to do and their kids won't shut the fuck up and they just kind of smack.  Yeah, it's terrible. Very sad.  It's the saddest fucking time ever because people are losing their jobs and they're losing their livelihoods. And they didn't do anything wrong. Right.  And they only tell nobody's addressing that. Right. Like nobody's addressing that.  And then there's a lot of people, you know, you know, celebrities and people that have a lot of money that are shaming people who want to go back to work. Yeah. And they're saying that these people just want to go out and party and have fun. It's like, no, they need to earn money.  Yeah, well, that's shaming people that want to do shows.  I've seen that. Right? Yeah, it's crazy. They're fools. They're people with money. And you listen, people listen.  People can do almost anything that puts them at risk and freely.  Right. You can BMX bike, you can fucking bungee jump. You could go. Yeah. Sale. You can eat anything you want. Yeah.  You can sail the ocean. You could fuck fucking you could hang glide. You can. Do all these different things that are like super dangerous, you can do anything you want and go get drunk all the time, kill your liver. Right. The idea that this shouldn't be something that you should be able to try or do because you're going to put other people at risk. But that that gets real sketchy. That gets real sketchy because the people that are at risk, they know they're at risk.  It's not like you're sneaking up on them. It's it's one thing if you have a kid this work, it's dangerous. If you have, like a 21 year old kid who parties all the time and then you're like 16 and your kid comes home and he gives it to you and you die. Right. That that's real. Yeah, that's real. If you live with your fucking parents or you live with your grandparents. Yeah. Don't do anything high risk, you fucking asshole.  Yeah.  But if you're like a regular person person who lives by themselves and lives with some friends and you want to be able to go out and you're willing to take the risk, you should be able to should be able to.  People need to make money. Well, the government's not supposed to be able to have that kind of power over you. Right. And once they have it, it's very difficult for them to let it go. Yeah, well, we saw it after 9/11, right after 9/11.  The government took a lot of power, supposedly for a very good virtuous for reasons of keeping America safe and protecting everybody. And a lot of those powers, they never let them go.  Are we going to go right into conspiracies? They never gave them back. No, I just I just thought it was a nice Segway. You have your cute. I just thought it was a nice Segway, that's all.  I just thought we could bring up 9/11 really quick. Just we could go with just a nice Ruchika, you know, the military justice. But I mean, it's true. They have a lot of power and they don't give it back. And none of the powers they get, they don't give them back. They don't go, oh, the disease is over. Now we're going to, you know, contact tracing.  It sounds great, right? Is somebody oh, it doesn't even sound right. But the idea of it is like if you're in contact with people, they trace who you are in contact with because of it. They're going to do that for other reasons. And you're not going to like it. They're going to use that technology to trace people that are considered anti-social personality disorder or whatever it is.  They don't like what you posted on Facebook. They don't like I mean, that's coming or how.  But what if you get injured, if you hurt your back and they know that they put you on pills. Right. And then they say, hey, right. You drive and tell me what's going on.  Driving right back, sir, you're on the pills. Are you driving on pills? Yeah. Or whatever the fuck it is.  If there's someone like Snowden talked about how people could just read your emails. Right, right. Well, who's what's to stop someone from tracing you?  Like, say you have some political disagreement with some guy who's in office, but you also cheat on your wife. Right. And they go, look, Tim's going over to this fucking lady's house. Yeah. Slipping out of your fucking schlussel. Right. Right. It's it's a huge problem.  It's a problem that. No, but like we've all resigned ourselves to the fact that it's happening and we just go. Right. You shrug. Well, we're busy. Yeah. That's how we feel about a lot of things. So there's too much to think about.  That's how it is with the NSA. You know, the mass surveillance. I mean, people just sort of go, well, we're going to do what are you going to do?  Yeah, those people are like, you know, my favorite. And I've said it, too. It's like they're like, if you want to surveil me doing nothing, you know, that's everybody's like, Yeah, hey, surveil me.  I get it. I've said I made jokes like that. But it's it's I think it's when you look at tech and how much power the tech has acquired over the last five years, for example, have you watched the social dilemma?  I did. Holy fuck I did. Yeah.  I mean, I thought a lot of that was pretty well known before.  It was well known to you. OK, but I think for people who don't like really pay attention to it. See, here's what I'm seeing. You and I and the regular folks.  Right. People have a real job. So if you work for Microsoft, your fucking job all day is thinking about Microsoft. Right? You have real important shit. You have bottom lines you have to bump up. Yeah. You have goals to me. Yeah. Meetings you have to get together. Right.  They have things to think of. They can't. We're just fucking off all day. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  No that is a good point. We don't, we don't. Well and part of our job is to kind of fuck off. Yes. Right. Part of our job is to figure out what's funny out there. Right. And you can't do that by really focusing on one thing. You have to just go all over the place. Right.  But I think the social dilemma when I watch it, I was like, yeah, it's the thing with social media is it's not designed to work well, like it's designed to work how it's working.  Right. I mean, that was maybe the biggest thing about social dilemma. It's like this is designed to work this way. You should be fighting. The negativity spreads very quickly. People are going to go at each other's throats.  You're fighting with family, man. I fight.  I look, I watch family members fight each other that don't even talk in real life, like they wouldn't even know each other existence.  But they they find each other and fight and they would never see each other. They would maybe do it once at a reunion every three years. But what's the answer? Is the answer to just log off?  That seems to be the only answer in logging off.  It's not the worst idea. Right. I think, you know, I was in the woods recently. I was in Utah hunting and no service for three days and it was great.  Do you feel a high better say like you feel a high the day, like a day of no phone. They say you feel like you get up the next day. You're noticing like birds. You notice things you feel. Better yet, if you can't check your phone all the time because it doesn't work, yeah, you don't check your phone. Yeah, we're going to look at your pictures over and over again. You're not right.  You want interaction. That's what I want to check. Like dopamine here. Yeah.  I don't read comments and I don't check likes and I don't I have a very strict policy and it's made me very happy.  But even that even that. Yeah, I watch I look at other people's shit.  So I would go to look at your page and laugh at your stuff and I go read your comments. Right.  This guy's a piece of shit and read assholes. I mean and yeah, even though it's not about me, it has nothing to do with me. I still occasionally run to things that bothered me. I run into behavior that annoyed me. And then like, why am I focusing on some person that doesn't even have a real name? Yeah, their name is like, you know, fucking a pint. Yeah.  Why stop the comments when one of them was said that we think Whitney Cummings is Tim CIA handler? I said I'm going to check out now like this is.  Yeah, they were like, he's not talking about Obama. Get on his show. It's because when Whitney comes to talking about to like when he comes, I love her to death. I don't think she knows what Obama is. And I have mentioned it a few times.  It was like but it was just so funny. I started laughing.  But I'm like I because it's people's mental illness, like you're just living in people's very dysfunctional minds.  Well, these people I know that. I know not good friends, but I know pretty casually. Yeah. That will tell me that they think the CIA talks to me about who I can have on the show. Right. You know, because I've had Mike Baker on. Right. Who used to be in the CIA.  Still most likely he's still I even joked with them.  Yeah. But my interaction with him is about what we talk about on the podcast. Right. And then afterwards we talk about like fishing.  Yeah, right. Right. That's how you in a room and threaten, you know, does none of us seem to have a podcasting division.  Right. Like they're not like who's on Marrin this week. That's not what they're they're not booking podcasts.  I bet they do. Now, that's interesting. They might I bet they do now that before we came around. But now they might I would imagine their stance.  They're big in movies, they're big and movies that's huge.  Like movies, especially movies that are made about, you know, Zero Dark Thirty, things like that, about the torture. Kathryn Bigelow, like, they try to justify their policies to popular culture all the time. Oh, yeah, it's propaganda. Yeah. But I just think it's hilarious, the idea that they have to now check who's on a podcast. Yeah.  I don't know if it's the CIA. I mean, I don't know who's doing that, but at some point in government most certainly has relationships with Hollywood and also like the people in Hollywood.  If the CIA calls you up and you're doing a movie like Zero Dark Thirty and they go, we'd like to talk to you about this, like, fuck, yeah, we're going to talk to the CIA when we talk to the SEALs, we're going to talk to the NSA. Yeah, you want to know?  Yeah, you want to know. But then they can also feed you whatever information they for. Sure. There's that for sure. That's happened for sure. There's been propaganda that's been spilled through Hollywood. There's no doubt about it. I just think they missed the boat on this podcast thing. They didn't know it was coming. They should have gotten involved. They should have gotten involved.  They had a need to have a few undercover CIA agents doing a podcast out of the Brooklyn apartment, you know, wouldn't be good.  And making millions not made after all, mental illness. You have to be a little sick. Yeah, I mean, when I think of how many how many hours I've talked to or how many hours you've talked for, there's something wrong. Something wrong. Something very wrong.  Sure. Yeah. Yeah. Then people need to realize that, like if you take my opinion seriously, like listen to me, I don't even take my opinion seriously. What are you listening to me for. Right. Half the time I'm just thinking out loud. Right.  I have like literally maybe forty percent of the things that I say on this podcast. I don't know what I'm saying. What I'm saying it right. I'm just thinking out loud. Right.  And that's a whole art form of doing this because you can't you have to explore every possibility. Yeah. And sometimes I have a thought that's very well thought out sometimes where it's like, no, I've thought about this for a while and this is why I believe this. Yeah. And there's a difference.  Like, you'll hear me, right? You hear things that I say that I like really quickly. I know what I'm saying. I know what I'm talking. Then you hear like rambling nonsense, right?  And you got to that's just how it goes. If you think out loud, you're going to have both of those things.  Why do you think people get so angry at the idea of that? Like, people get very angry at the idea of like being just being open to the idea of being wrong.  Like people get angry and they're like every word out of your mouth has to be absolutely the what you want it to be. And it's weird to me because we're in a gotcha sound bite culture.  Right. So one of the ways they'll digest your show or my show is some will put a clip up. Look with this piece of shit. Tim Dillon said it'll have something that you said completely out of context and a two and a half hour rant, right. Where you just like talking nonsense about JFK still being alive or whatever it is. Yeah, I mean, I, I my live show every every, every shot. But doing right now by saying thanks for having me, everybody, Ruth Bader Ginsburg is burning in hell.  That's and it's that's fun because to me I'm like, you know, all I've seen is praise lavished upon her and deservedly so. Right. But the funny angle to me is that she's actually burning in hell.  And good night, and that's fine, but if you take that and you and you know, you don't understand that, that's a funny thing to say. Yes.  And that there is no hell probably and I don't know who's there. But that's the funny angle to say, of course. Yeah. Yeah.  Well, that's, you know, one of the things Louis C.K. said when he was talking about comedy material and, you know, getting in trouble for material.  He's like comedy is often saying things that you're not supposed to say.  Right. Like that's why you say it, because everyone knows you're not supposed to say it. And then you go and say like, oh, my God. And that's what's funny. Yes.  The idea that you're holding people to those thoughts as if this is like an affidavit. Right. And they've signed this. They've worked it out with lawyers. And this is my position. Yeah. And this is this is where I stand.  No, you're literally talking off the cuff saying something preposterous, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg is burning in hell. Right? Right. And you're doing that just so everybody else goes by.  It gets a big everybody because it's crazy. It's entertaining, it's crazy and maybe true. Well, but what is crazy about it is that it's you know, it's the unexpected. It's the it's the crazy. You just out there say the most insane thing you can.  Well, the thing about it today, though, is everyone is looking to catch people saying things you shouldn't say and getting mad at you.  And then they want to silence you. Right. They want to stop you from saying the things that you just happen to carry.  You know, to me, it's like a lot of this is the death of curiosity, right? Because I grew up and I listen to all these different radio shows.  I would listen to AM talk radio guys like Bob Grant and Rush Limbaugh. Oh, yeah, I remember Bob Grant. He used to, like, get off my phone, you fake phony fraud, and you would just hang up on people. He would fight with people. Guys would call him was always like the same guy was like, Bob, this is Tony from Seaside Heights. And he would go and you go, you know, I think you you know, the Clintons.  I did give you a little time, Bob. Will you shut up? And they would just fight all day.  And I didn't know if the guy was right or if he was wrong. I just knew what was happening was hilarious. Yeah. And interesting. And I was curious about what other people in the world that was a young kid being driven around by my parents.  But I'm like I was curious about what other people in the world thought, what they were saying, because when you listen to those talk radio shows, you're in a car, you're driving around and you hear some psychopath on that call calling Bob Grant like they used to say to Bob Grant, they'll be like, you know, you really disappointed me.  And Bob Grant would go, Do you know me? Do you have any knowledge of who I am? Like, I disappointed you. And then you would try to look at the cars back. I wonder what psychopath went home and called the guy, you know? So I was just curious. Now it seems like there's this depth of curiosity where no one is curious about what anyone else is thinking. Unless it happens to be what they're thinking.  It has to decide exactly with how you view the world so you can enjoy it.  It's it's part of it is social media and part of it is Trump. Right.  Trump has he his brand of being president.  His way of doing it has polarized people so hard that they will do anything and everything they can to keep him from being president and again, being president a second term. And they're forcing compliance.  You have to comply with our view of what's going on in the world.  And I think I find it fascinating, just going through my Instagram feed and looking at people are Trump supporters and Trump haters and looking at their perspectives. Right.  And looking at this this fucking giant Grand Canyon like divide.  And my favorite thing is vote. Tell everyone to vote. That's what everyone does now. It's television. I did a whole podcast episode this week. I go, I'm not telling you to vote is not my job. Vote or don't vote. It's like I don't tell you to eat your vegetables. I don't tell you to jog. Right. I'll tell you to do anything I'm telling you have to meditate.  Hey, raise your kids. You spend time with your kids, you're spending time with your son. He's in college. You and him don't talk like what in God's name? Like you walk into a nightclub to see me. I say Ruth Bader Ginsburg is burning it out. Then I turn around to everyone, make sure to have a voting plan.  Well, what's happened is there's a lot of these fucking idiots that aren't getting any attention.  And we've found out why they're in show business. They're not just in show business to create. They're not just in show business to hone their craft and to be good as an actor or be good as a comic. They want attention. Right. And when there's no intention to be had on stage, they seek it out on Twitter and they seek it out by being correct about, yeah, some people are using Twitter and it's just hilarious.  I was just saying ridiculous shit. Very funny. Same thing with Instagram. Like little Duval's my favorite say. Never gets political. Never gets serious. Right. Everything is just having a good time. Yeah.  Occasionally talking about Pussy Riot, that's that's mostly what he does. Yeah. But some people they, they lack that self awareness and all they want is likes.  Right. So they try to figure out what can I say to get people thinking that I'm really progressive and really open minded and you know, what can I say. Yeah, they're really like hits the tone and gets a lot of juice he likes. Yeah.  I'd like to hit about 2000 one.  It's so weird because to me, social media, so fun because like the people that are really the best. At our 15th day, they're the winners like a tick tock, kids of the winners, the million girls have like 80 like you. They're making money. They're making real money like millions of dollars more than pass.  Yeah. My 12 year old boxer on the household, she's. Yes.  So what are we all even trying to like? Your take is not half of them going like this. So what are we doing? Like, your numbers are not like those. So I look at it. It's like it's a joke. Like social media should be a joke because it is a joke because the people that are really monetizing it, like a lot of those people, their 16 year old, and they're dancing around and it's like and it's unserious.  But if you really think the accumulation of time during the day, right.  If you look at people's phones, I'd love to grab a listen. Milano's fall and go eight hours.  Eight hours. You're on your phone. Eight hours. How many of these people are interacting with other human beings for eight hours a day?  Not not yeah. Not very few. Very few. And certainly not having meaningful conversations and long.  What they're doing is they're seeking approval through others online and it's very fake, like hollow, shallow way. And that's what Twitter is. It's arguing with people and but some people use it. Well, there's journalists that use it. Well, there's there's people that might find interesting things to discuss. And they some people pull it off, but it's not many.  Yeah. I'm wondering if the answer is just abstinence, because I don't think people can handle this. Right. So what are you found out? Yeah, I think that you might have to just disconnect that.  I wonder if subsequent generations will like they'll just go. We saw what happened in twenty twenty and this stuff almost led to a civil war and craziness. We don't want any part of it.  Too many people like it. Too many people like it for everybody to jump off. But I think enough people can understand because documentaries like the social dilemma and conversations that they have with each other about it, where they're going to they're going to check out. And, you know, what does that the light phone is what is called the one that it's like it's black and white phone. All you could do is text and make phone calls off of it.  It's like a small. Yeah.  So it doesn't give you the like, the vivid imagery of an iPhone. You can't watch YouTube videos, just call 911. But if you want to text me, you can text me and if you want to call me, you can call me.  And that's all it does.  So no, no data that what is called the light phone. Yeah. Look at this thing.  See, this is for people that realize they're junkies and they're like, oh, I'm a junkie.  What do you do? It's kind of it's a little embarrassing now that you go.  I can't control myself. I need it like it is. And it isn't, though, because there's something to be said for this. There's something really good to be said for this.  Yeah, it's a phone, an alarm. Oh, you can play music on it.  You can get a taxi. Taxi. What do you live, you know, live in Bangladesh.  Satellite phones going to sneak in a messaging feature like light phones. It's going to start to creep in.  No, no, no, no. I'm amazed that it has music on it, though. I am shocked by that. The light phone can call, text or set alarms out of the box. What's up, Jimmy?  Right there. Some parent will buy this for the kid. Like you can have a phone, but all you can have is a light phone and then kids will hack it. Oh, my God.  It's coming. It's coming. There should be it. By the way.  They should have like a fight phone where the only thing on his Twitter, you don't call anyone you can't text, just have a fake phone. It's just Twitter and Facebook and you can't call 911.  What if you get hit by a car? Optional tech available includes Calculator, a simple music player and a podcast too, while you fucked up their big profit.  Yes, big problem.  Here's an animation of some of the interfaces, our future tools that are still in development. Not all these tools are yet available.  You know, I know friends who have taken Twitter and Instagram and Sam Harris deleted Instagram off his phone a long time ago. He told me he goes, I'm infinitely happier without it on my phone because he would get in arguments with people on Instagram excuse me, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter.  And I would text him, obviously. What the fuck are you doing, man? You're a neuroscientist. You're pregnant wife, right? With people. I might with these idiots.  But it's still like you get wrapped up in people, like saying disparaging things about you.  Yeah. You're being defamed. And, you know, I read it. I have to read it. You have to read it. Keep moving.  You're big. You're big with that.  Like you don't get into the fray when people say nonsense about I don't too many people saying nonsense about right where I had to spend my whole day doing right because that's what it would take. Hours and hours. Yeah. And that's how you wind up not being productive. You want to be successful, you want to get things done.  You can argue with people about who you are. Right. You want do you know who you are? If you know who you are, you can't argue with people about who you are. Right.  You know, makes sense.  And people want to bring up mistakes you've made ten years ago or five years ago, like, OK, great, good luck with that. Try to diminish me.  Yeah, it's a silly way to treat people. Right. I wouldn't do it to other people.  I don't want them to do it to me. But I don't want to argue with you either. Right. If you want to talk in person, if people want to talk in person, that's how people work things out. And most of the time when you do that, you wind up hugging or laughing.  Most people are cool. Yeah, it's a shit way to communicate. It's bad. I know people see people that are fighting on Facebook and I'm like, I know you have each other's numbers.  Right. And and also fuck the number. If you saw each other in person, I guarantee you just talk. Right, nine times out of ten. Right. You would just talk, you would just be like, well, I think he's this and that. Well, maybe, I mean, I don't know, like, you'd work it out, right.  It's not that wall that's between you on social media. It's also like when someone's writing something and you can't you're not there in front of them. They're just writing it. And then you have to read it and then you write something back.  It's like it's we have an amazing way to communicate. It involves looking at each other and involves being near each other and involves registering. When you say something mean and it bothers a person. Right. Like all that stuff out the window when you're just texting or when you're tweeting, tweeting is even worse. Right. You guys in the whole world seeing it and you know, someone saying something mean about you and other people reading it.  Oh, right.  This must be real. Other people can read it. Yeah. It's it's a terrible way to communicate.  It's the worst it's probably the worst way in history we've ever had to have a productive conversation.  And there are so many people that are mentally ill because of it. Yeah, mentally ill.  Do you think it exacerbated something? Yeah. Hundred percent.  Yeah. And a lot of them are these fucking actors and actresses. Yeah. That are just they're not getting any attention.  It's narcissism run wild and there's no puncturing it with any type of objective reality or facts or they're creating their own world to live in.  Does this get worse though? I think it kind of gets worse. I think it heads to a kind of dystopian place where everybody lives in their own reality.  We're seeing that right now.  And it just seems to be inevitable to a degree.  The real fear is that it's going to get more immersive. Right. The real fear is that the solution will be even worse than this.  And it's going to be like in your head. Yeah, yeah, yeah. So NewLink type shit that the next level of interaction, the next level of technology is going to be way more immersive. That's what I'm worried about. I'm worried. I'm worried. It's not going to be something you escape from, like you're going to like you just leave your phone there.  You know, this if that phone goes into your body. Exactly. You're not escaping.  Yeah. You just hit the switch, Tim. Just hit the switch. Don't turn it on when you pee and you don't check your messages while you're open. Just let me see how people feel about it. Click Everyone's mad.  I would hate spamming Meghan McCain. Rudy Yeah. I'm going to be honest with you.  It sounds so convenient, the chip already because I lose my phone a lot. And so I'm like already like I could just get a chip and then just kind of click it on and I will just chip.  Yeah. I'm worried about you're a strong man. You can put your sticks and stones can hurt your bones.  I know. Maybe we should all embrace it. Maybe we should just go that route. Like maybe there is no fight anymore. Maybe we should just but maybe we're not spending enough time on Twitter. Right.  Just be a country for hours and just lay in a spot and tweet, go to war, go to war, just fire off tweets all day everyday.  Fight with people you don't know. Just just quote people go bad. Take no, I love that.  You just quote off. Nope. Fuck off. Bad take. Be better, be better. Be better. Just keep going.  Just all the passive aggressive shit that you could say. Yeah.  You almost wonder is it just do you just jump in hard and then you have like Facebook which is the to me the funniest one because it is truly a great it's a graveyard, it's, it's elderly people screaming out into the void.  Into nothingness. Right. It's purgatory. Yeah. Multiple paragraph. Perhaps it's purgatory for people that are like on their deathbed.  They're in the latter years of their life. Their dog just died. They've got a picture of their dead dog on Facebook. They're saying Max took his last nap and then they're writing three paragraphs about Kamala Harris.  It's like this is crazy.  And then other people are fighting with them and it's really sick. But I like I enjoy it.  I do a thread sometimes instead of a Netflix movie. Sometimes I'll just do a three hundred comment thread and just.  Yeah, just read it. I'll just read it. I'll just I'll just go. Wow. Interesting. You know, some people are surprisingly smart.  Some people are so out there, some people that used to sell me cocaine are now big into family values. So I love that. Yeah.  A lot of my ex coke dealers are now Q people, so they're like they're like Save the Children. I'm like, you didn't raise your children, you sold me cocaine. I was a child. I was doing it when I was in my teens. And now you're like, we need to save the children in the tunnels. I'm like, what? So it's fun to track the progression of people through those sites.  Yeah, there's enough real child trafficking where those people get like positive reinforcement of their ideas. Of course, like we were talking about recently, Jamie, those 35 people that were saved in Georgia. No, that's wrong is they are they're also right. Yeah, that's the thing about that's you people as wrong as they are, they're also right. In certain instances there's human trafficking is a massive problem.  And there have been massive cover ups with our government and many other governments.  Do you know that right now? Just have one right now.  Today there's more slavery today than when we had slavery in that state's 25 missing endangered kids rescued in Ohio over two weeks. U.S. Marshals located dozens of missing children between the ages of 13 and 18 in a mission called Operation Safety Net. The children found Cleveland, East Cleveland, Akron, Mansfield. What is that useful? You include Euclid. Will it be an even Miami, Florida?  Wow. Sorry. That's an operation. That's a trafficking operation. It's real. Yeah, that is real.  And it's particularly real when, you know, you can get kids that are orphans fall through the cracks. Foster kids. Yeah. And the government.  I mean this is what nobody really wants to admit that the United States government at all levels has in many ways like been either a kind of I wouldn't I won't say a sponsor of this on the whole.  But there's elements of the CIA that have allowed things like this to happen in order to get information on people.  This is this is what was the idea about the Eppstein? Absolutely. It was that they let him do that.  They would have something over these people and that is sick beyond human comprehension. And most people don't want to really admit that's happening.  Right. And when I think, like a lot of the people found that stuff out, then their brains melted and they were like, oh, but David Spade's eating kids, it's like, that's not it. That's not where it goes.  What it is, is that you have a lot of people that are, you know, getting educated overnight and their minds cannot handle the amount of information, much of it very disturbing.  Remember last week when you asked that like that was the first time that that happened, like Eppstein style story. And I mentioned that which which I've seen stuff like that.  I think you said something like this has never happened before, like Senator.  Oh, that's right. And then you found out of the story. He's the one I learned about it from.  Uh huh, yeah. Well, no, this happened before. It happened in Omaha, Nebraska, was called the Franklin scandal. A lot of people know about it. A guy named Nick Bryant wrote a book about it. And there was an interstate pedophile network that was trafficking kids to wealthy and powerful people, many of them in the government. I mean, there's a market, there's money.  But this was the one that's separate from the North Fox Island because North Fox Island also.  I mean, there's many, many you know, a lot of. Yeah, there's many guys on the podcast. It blew my mind. I didn't know it. And I was a conspiracy guy and I had no idea that this was going on. But a lot of it is blackmail. Yeah. And a lot of it is people allowing the worst things imaginable to happen to children in order to gain leverage on other people. That's what was happening with Epstein.  That's what was happening with Franklin. But it's also people that have that hunger. They have this appetite for that shit.  Of course, they're they're sick, sadistic pedophiles.  And then some group of people call it an intelligence agency or whoever whoever wants to leverage whoever wants power is using this as a means to obtain it.  Yeah. So even though the people are all right, because they're saying like, well, everyone in Hollywood has been executed and other clones, I mean, it's like it's kind of funny. It's kind of funny a little bit.  You know, they're really, you know, JFK Jr. is alive. There's some real wild stuff. But the core premise, which is that human trafficking is a horrible, insidious thing, that it connected to many high, high powered people isn't necessarily wrong, right?  No, it's not it's not wrong. And there's a lot of evidence throughout history. That's why, you know, that pizza gets shit turned out to be nonsense.  But but they're creepy and that art is creepy.  It's not just that the artist creepy. Yeah. It's that the the Breitbart wrote a tweet about John Podesta.  Yeah. And he said something to the degree of when will it come out that John Podesta is like protecting, you know, sexual predators or something like that? I forget the tweet.  Cheney could find it, but it was along the lines of that. It was almost like that he was helping them. Right? Enabling Barack enabling. Yes. And I figure yeah. I mean, there have been people like that in high levels of government and in leadership.  There it is how Praag guru John Podesta isn't a household name as world class underage sex slave op cover up or defending unspeakable drugs escapes me now.  2011, February 4th, he died shortly after that, yeah, he didn't die long after that, not long. But he also was unhealthy and he was kind of crazy, too.  I don't know much about him, but I'm sure he was a little wild. I mean, to get into that business, you have to be right.  I would imagine. I mean, he was a guy that did a lot of stunts. He was very like, you know, he was like one of the incendiary like he, you know, made a name for himself and made a name for his company.  That's the problem with those guys is. Yeah, like whenever someone goes way out of their way to do stunts and to do things, it's like, yeah.  And then something else if you're involved in something and then it's legitimate. Now I have to go. Right.  But is it is that the guy what the fuck is his name. That guy that's always doing the undercover shit. James Yeah. James O'Keefe, he's got a new one now about Elin. Omar, ballots in the Porsche, the ballots in the car. And he's got these guys saying, look at all these ballots, look at all these ballots, but you got to go with that guy. You got to go.  OK, but didn't he didn't he there was some shit with Roy Moore where they were trying to get girls to say that he knocked them up.  And there was like a lot of anybody, just like anybody that, you know, he he's coming to this with an agenda. But then he also catches shit that's real. Yes. Like he caught those people on Twitter, the Twitter executives talking about how the shadow man, people talking about the banned conservatives or how they block conservatives. Right. That's all real. Right? That's all really. Absolutely.  So it's like whenever someone can't be straight with you and they have little tricks and they have stunts, remember that?  You know, I think the argument that those guys make is that to get any attention in the climate that we're in, it's almost impossible to do it with like a sober, reasoned, rational approach.  You have to because it's a circus. You're competing with Trump. They're competing with anybody.  They're competing for oxygen with some of the most the most entertaining president in history. By far. By far. Right.  So anything you do now has to be on that level of of of spectacle to get any type of attention.  You look at the intellectuals that were whether they were left wing or right wing from 30 or 40 years ago, they're appalled at the people now who are carrying their message. But the people now who are carrying their message are like we're we're we're existing in the climate that we're in now.  What is the general consensus like? How is the media treating this Illand Omar thing? Am I saying her name right? Ileum.  I mean I mean, look at me. Do you think I know how to pronounce, you know better than me, Ilana Omar's name when I look today.  I saw yesterday the initial response I saw was more from like liberal sites for being like this is just to fog the conversation because of all the tax stuff that just came out and that like take this with a grain of salt because of his history.  Yeah, but takes time to so it takes time to get gather up that kind of information. I don't buy that. It's just when the tax stuff came out because that seems like something the guy's got.  He's got absentee ballots.  Yeah. Car. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Just filling them out. People fill them out if it's not works.  Here's the thing, if that's not real and this turns out to be bullshit, there should be a punishment for that. Absolutely. Because you are you are absolutely manipulating.  You know, it was fun. Remember the kid, Jacob Wuhl, who got banned on Twitter, this guy which just set up these blatantly fake things, like they tried to get I forget maybe Robert Mueller or somebody they tried to get somebody accused of sexual assault. He would do these stunts all the time, this kid, Jacob Wall, and he would just he's a fun young guy from Orange County.  He's a fun guy. And he would just go on Twitter and, like, try to he would do fake press conference, Joe. They would call the whole media and they would go, we're about to reveal something spectacular and crazy. And none of it was ever true. And I mean, he would just do this over and over again.  So that was just his thing. It was just he was just having fun.  He's a kid having fun. But what I was going to say is, yeah, but if it turns out to be true, there should be punishment as well. And right. Like when something like that gets revealed and the more of those that turn out to not be true like this should be a number of those you could pull off right before we go. Right.  We we can't listen to you anymore. Why is he there?  Like, I don't know, because I. That kid is. That kid is. But the James O'Keefe guy isn't. No, because I have intelligent friends. Yeah. That sent me the Ohmar thing and they're like, this is very disturbing.  Well, I think a lot of it is. I mean like we were talking true.  They said it's true. You have true caveats for you, if true, those two words, right? Yeah. Yeah.  It's true that in there I mean, if I'm in any of the James O'Keefe videos, you know, they're a lie.  If James O'Keefe has me with a bunch of ballots in my car, we know it's. Yeah. And you're driving a cab.  Yeah, I'm driving a cab, you know, and I got all these ballots and I'm speaking to Jamaican accent. Yes. Then yes.  Unfortunately, I don't know if it's true. I mean, it was it was fun. Because he was tweeting out that she said something about how vote fraud, voter fraud is like this, like the numbers of voter fraud are so minuscule, like zero point zero zero zero six percent. Yeah. Then he tweets out the stuff about her and voter fraud. Right.  And I'm wondering how big I don't know how big voter fraud is. I that's something I have no idea. I've never met a person in my life.  It's like, you know, what I'm going to do today? I'm going to go and vote seven times. I've never met that person.  The one thing I mean, watching the video, just watching it, it's obviously highly edited.  So like you can't say, it's not an edited video that doesn't take a lot of things away. But you have to edit that. You kind of have to vet it.  Right, because it's got to be small. You don't know who the people are that are being covered up. I think when I was so, I was reading through people that are like I think Newsweek was digging into each piece of it today. And like, I don't know that they could verify everything because they weren't saying that this was necessarily false, but they asked if that guy worked for who they said he worked for. And I don't think they got a response that said, yes, he verifiably works for this like these people or so.  So that's where it kind of gets.  But why would if someone was doing something that illegal, why would they be like, who are you?  A strange man with come to come, come back on backlog brigalow everywhere. What is James O'Keefe still?  He's just goes I'm just going to figure out a fun conspiracy that's happening.  Like he goes like how does he get into these things. He gets it and then he goes let's just get some cameras in there. I don't know.  It's like a YouTube prank show fused with like political exposes. The problem is the Twitter stuff.  The problem is the stuff where he actually did uncover executives or excuse me, catch employees that were talking about how they make it so that conservative voices don't get heard.  Yeah, which I believe we know it's a hundred percent. It's real. It's real. And whether or not it is top down or whether or not the tools are available to employees. Yeah. And they act as activists. That's possible to write something too. I was reading about this. I think it's about ballot harvesting. And according to this article, it says that it's actually not illegal in Minnesota. But there have been propositions currently I think Tulsi Gabbard put something up to like have it be made illegal, I think nationwide.  So like ballot harvesting is not something I understand.  What the hell is ballot hall? Explain ballot harvest.  I wish I could, but as from what I read quickly about it. Certain workers who are not supposed to be paid by anyone, which is part of like you're not supposed to be paid for, this is right, it gets muddy. You're allowed to go collect ballots from people to turn them in.  Right.  But only three, I think you can't be more than three. Right. That's where it gets really. Yeah, that's what I read.  And this guy had a whole bag of stuff I do on camera. You for me. Come with me. I show you my stupid ballot. Some feels off about right. It feels a little fake but I don't want to go to jail, but it might be rigged.  He might be the kind of guy that you hire to do something like because he's a crazy guy who works for cab company. Right. And you know, he doesn't give a fuck and he doesn't know there's a camera, doesn't care. Maybe he doesn't know there's a camera on him and maybe what's edited it is this guy going, you know what, fuck Trump. I hope I'll fucking if I could wrote 30 times, I'd vote 30 times that we need to get him out of office.  He's fucking racist. And he says he's a piece of shit. You know, he didn't pay any fucking taxes. That fucking guy's always going off about socialism. He's a fucking socialist. Look, I got a dirty ballot. I fucking cheat. I'm a cheater and a liar. And I get paid. I throw these away. I watch that.  I was like, what is this like? What? I mean, people should watch it because it's interesting. And so what is this? What is what is this? Yeah.  I mean, this election this election is going to have problems. It's going to be chaos. That's why I'm in Texas. Yeah. You should move here before November 3rd. I'm locking myself in my studio. I'm doing my part. I'm doing an event where I go. I'm not leaving the studio until there's a president. Oh, will you be there for years?  While I hope not, but I'm doing I'm going to lock myself and it's going to be Pelosi. Forty eight hours. You think it's going to get that bad? Yeah.  And she's going to do all the press conferences from that very beauty salon where she didn't wear a mask.  I heard. If I think if the president doesn't accept the results, whatever, there is like a time period where it's not decided, she does become the. Oh, yeah.  Third person in charge. She's the speaker of the House. That's how it works. That's real. Well, we need a landslide. We need whoever wins. We need someone to take Florida and Ohio early in the night.  I don't know if it counts without the ballots, if they're going to if they're encouraging mailing about. Here's what disturbs me. When one party wants mail in ballots and the other party doesn't like, why do they want it? I don't know the answer to this. I'm just speculating. Why do the Democrats want it and why does Trump not want it?  Democrats are saying covid is going to keep people from voting. Is it? I don't believe it is. I think that's where all come up.  Is it keeping people from buying groceries is keeping people from going to Jack in the Box? Yeah, and I know people that these people hate Trump so much.  It's like, well, then have that be your last act. Have that be your last earthly act. Do how how beautiful would that be? Because all you've done right. There you go. All you've done is say this guy's ruined your life every day.  Go and die and get rid of him. I wish there was someone to root for. I know you don't wish there was someone who just stood out as being like this fucking perfect person that I really love. Now, we don't have that.  I wish it was Tulsi Gabbard. I wish I'd fucking vote for naked. Yeah, I'd be out there covering my mouth about.  I'm voting for. Well, there were people that were interesting. Like Sanders was interesting because he was he didn't seem like he was in the system like everybody else was. Yeah. But it also seemed like maybe a lot of what he wanted to do never would have gotten done. But I was interested to see if he could pull it off. And he was talking when people are talking about what he wanted to do versus what he was talking about, what he wanted to do, I was like, oh, they're distorting your your voice.  They're distorting your narrative. And when I had him on the podcast, we talked for a while. I'm like, you're not crazy, right? You're just a good guy. Right. Who wants to do well for the working people and your ideas to take a small fraction, less than a penny of the speculation trades. Right. And then take the money off of that and dedicated to social causes like I'm in. Yeah, I mean, if that was what it was, I think a lot of people would have been in.  But it's he's just one of those small group of politicians that is doesn't get the airtime like you gave him airtime. But you rightly said he had to explain that in 30 seconds.  Yes. And under normal circumstances. But then I gave this tepid endorsement of him and they used that with all the old jokes and shit that I said.  He's homophobic, trans phobic, racist, that fucking everything.  And they took him out. They took him out. And then the fucking DNC all aligned together to get Mayor Pete and Amy Klobuchar and Elizabeth Warren, who they want all Divx out. They quit. Yeah. And so that they had Biden would get the.  Yeah, it's the whole thing was dirty and see is rigged this now like twice against him. Pretty much.  Plus they did it. Donna Brazile book talks openly about it. Right. You know, only twice dude. It's a dirty organization.  They're both dirty, but both sides are too nice. Yes.  Trump, like Trump, just let the Republican Party on fire.  I mean, he went in there. He said McCain is not a hero. I like people who didn't get captured. He went right at Jeb Bush.  I mean, they were mass they were the political dynasty in the Republican Party. He just lay sleepy, laid waste to that low energy. Jeb, low energy.  Jeb just went in there and Sanders was like, oh, these are my colleagues and I respect him. I'm like, that's not the way to look.  That's the reason why he did that, because that's who he really is. I know. And he's not bullshitter. He's not full of shit. And that's why I liked him. I enjoyed talking to him. Yeah, I really did.  I know we'll get to see it in Vermont. He'll write a book that he's going to buy that book. No one's going to buy it. He can write it down a little. He can have a little ice cream.  But if you want in the big game, you got it. You've got to go on thing. You've got to get clobbered.  Franco, shut up, you centrist bitch. And then you don't even know the president of Mexico. Then he has to go and just lay waste to everybody. Every time Kamala talked, he should have went cop. He should a dead cop. That's what Trump would have done.  He needed to be the left. Trump, like Biden, talks SANDERS Because this guy is dead. He's he's in bed with credit card companies in Delaware. He had the worst criminal justice bill ever. That guy's a corpse. Like, that's what Sanders should've nicknamed everyone, like Trump did. Corpse cop.  What's crazy is when there's corruption, but they'll ignore it because it'll it'll interfere with what they want. Right.  Like this Hunter Biden shit. Yes, bro. It's crazy. This was Donald Trump Jr. and his hunter, the one that passed away or.  No, he's the one is still alive. He's the one that took millions of dollars.  He's he married the the wife of the brother. I hope so. I don't know when something went wild there. Ryan didn't go wild. Jamie, someone weird with the brother, the tides wife.  And I think, oh, I could be wrong. Don't quote me on this.  But the scandal is that he took a shit ton of money from Russian billionaires. Right. Isn't that the scandal? Jaimie's double Googling right now?  Hold was was let's start with the brother, the wife of the. I could be wrong about this. Hunter Biden fathered a child with a woman while dating brothers widow.  Whoa, I mean, this is a while whole family, can I see a picture of this girl? Good point. She might have been hot as well. Joe Biden is the one on the right. Oh, OK. Hunter and Hayley Biden, they broke up after nearly two years of dating, he filed she filed a paternity suit same month Hunter Biden, 49, married Melissa Cohen after just six days of dating. Yeah, well, OK.  Maybe he found the perfect girl after he'd already knocked up this other chick and this other chick you fucking hated. But he vowed to take care of the baby, you know, but he's dating his widow.  That's interesting.  Messy. Sure. People are messy. Sure. Listen, the brother's dead. Maybe he's in love with the widow. Maybe it's a perfect relationship. Sounds good. I don't have a problem with Ryan. I mean, it's weird. It is strange. It's certainly salacious. Odd.  It's odd that Biden is holding up children and sniffing them. That that's a lot of sniffer. But what the other thing that bothers me is how much did he get from some billionaire? He got money from a Russian billionaire, I think was like some large of money companies.  They're all involved in this energy company. They all find these little scams that nobody knows about. And then eventually they come out like once every four years, election year.  But I think a lot of them were working for like the same energy company in the Ukraine that's involved with all of these problems.  Yeah, well, I mean, Hillary Clinton was involved with the Russians. You know what's hilarious? This one meme, it's a really good meme. Yeah. Here it is. Hunter Biden received three point five million wire transfer from Russian billionaire. Yeah, OK. He was briefed about sons. Biden was briefed about sons involvement, according to Hunter Biden's Verismo.  Hunter, Biden, bellissima, what does that mean? OK. Scrub, scrub. The company's purisma hunter, Biden, Joe Biden's son, Hunter, made money from Russia, China. OK, all right.  I don't know, maybe he earned the money, right?  I but I just know that it's weird that the media is kind of ignoring it. Well, the minimum is 100 percent in the tank. They don't want Trump winning 90 percent of the media, 90 percent of the American Fox News incandescence. Meanwhile, to media Shmeat, you know, you have a candidate who is bigger than anyone.  She is. She's on she's on Facebook. She's got like 300 million views. I mean, she's crazy giant. I mean, she's and I got to be honest with you, you can't not watch her whether you like her or not.  She is very smart. She's very articulate. She really knows how to talk. She knows how to talk.  But every now and then something while she'll like, she'll do a go fund me for like Timothy McVeigh. You see that.  But she still just doesn't suit over Trump.  A fair story after Fox News argues no responsible viewer takes Tucker Carlson seriously.  So their defense was that it's basically like parody almost. And that's why it's not.  Tucker Carlson is parody. Yeah, no.  Yeah. His lawyer's defense of what they were saying was that but this is a smart legal defense. This is what they all do. That's this is what they all do. That's a sneaky way they go.  It's a fake. It's fun in public time. I've heard in a lawsuit that Fox News has admitted they're not news. They're entertainment.  Yeah, I think they kind of have to do that like wrestling does. You have to say they don't really wrestling. I know what you're saying, but I know what you're saying.  But they choose you. It's a smart move. Yeah, it's a little walk around.  Did you see the thing where Tucker Carlson was playing all these videos of Chris Cuomo talking to Michael Cohen, coaching him on what to say when he interviews him, did not see that.  Oh, my God. Fox News, when CNN just ignored the fuck out of it, they reported and pretend it didn't even happen. Right. And they didn't address it at all.  And Fox News played it multiple times over multiple nights. It is clearly Chris Cuomo talking to Michael Cohen and he is coaching him on what to say when he talks to him about the hush payments. Crazy. But just like I don't know why he would even I don't know why they did that.  Well, the Cuomo I don't like the idea that one of them is a governor and the other one's in the news.  Yeah, I thought maybe my friends with Michael Cohen and he was just trying to help them out as a friend. Like, if you were going to be let's just be honest right now. I'm going to be honest with you. Yeah.  If Tim Dillon was involved in some fucked up shit and I had an interview on my podcast, what do I say?  You know, it's just you and me alone. I would coach you a hundred percent. I would say this is what you should say, right? Yeah. Especially if I was trying to help you. Right. Yeah, I understand that. But if he's friends with that guy. Yeah, I get it.  The problem is he he's a broadcaster on CNN, which is the cable news network was.  What is it now. It's nothing. I mean, it's nothing. I mean it's absurd. Yeah. Chris Cuomo is on there talking about he's got Caronna.  I mean, they're doing like home videos. I'm like, what is this, another scandal? Here's another scandal. Yeah. He pretended that caronna he is there's a little bit of the pretending to leave his basement.  I'm pretty sure a well he said he cured it by chest exercise. I mean, I don't buy that.  But here's another one. There's a picture of him sitting at his desk holding a hundred pound dumbbell up in the air and bodybuilders are calling bullshit. Oh, interesting.  I didn't see that also because of the angle that he's holding it now. Yeah, Chris Cuomo is.  I'm Italian. I could say this.  He's Guinea, right. A lot of those guineas are stupid, strong. They're monkeys. I bet he is the a lot of them. Yes. And this was a guy smart. There was a guy that used to run a sandwich shop near our house who could curl his own body weight ten times. And he nobody believed him. And this guy barely lifted weights and he did it before a wrestling me. He was like a big time wrestler, Newton s and he wound up losing the wrestling meet.  It was like a legend in the town because his arms were blown out because he made like a hundred bucks back, showing people that a girl's body weight ten times. I don't know if you drank substance.  This is nice. She's fucking serious, bro. This is where we get our news, and it now is there's a photo and he's wearing a T-shirt. This is different. That's real. That's a real weight. Whether or not that weighs 100 pounds, it might weigh 100 pounds. I don't believe that he has a fake 100 pound weight. He's a big person.  I think that guy is large. I'm sure he's not. I'm sure the weight isn't fake. That's the picture. Here's the thing.  I I saw these people that are complaining and saying it's not real and all this shit. I listen, you can do that, that can be done. People who think you can't do that are crazy. He's bigger than me, like he's bigger than me. And there's a video of me on Instagram with a 92 pound kettle bell, and I'm cleaning it and pressing it 10 times over my head. Right. He's big. That guy is a lot bigger than me.  Right. He can hold 100 pounds over his head and do it like that. Look, if I have a 100 pound dumbbell in my arm right now, I could press it.  He's bigger than me. He could do it. Some people are fucking strong.  Yeah, I don't have any problem with doing that. It's when he does this challenge to Chris Cuomo prove you're not a liar, prove you can actually lift that weight you're shown with C..  This guy just wants attention because you should know that there's people that are freekeh strong that could lift that. I like Franks country throw, and if that was the guy's name, Franks Country Store, Newton and Newton, it was in Newton. It wasn't Newton Upper Falls somewhere in Newton, Massachusetts, Newton Center.  That's such a great Boston story where it's like the guy loses the team. We to talk about mobile subs there because we'd walk there from school and buy subs from Frank Carleson body bodyweight 10 times.  He was a tank.  It's just a legend. It was just a fucking stacked little guiney, right. Like this five foot seven guy who's like five foot seven wide. I don't mind people not liking Trump.  It's weird when they're like angry. Like I see Chris Cuomo angry. They're angry. But isn't that his job? It shouldn't be.  But it's entertainment. Like Tucker Carlson said Tamasha. He's entertainment on the other side. Yeah, but anyway, Tucker Carlson has been ruthless, let's say a lot about Tucker Carlson.  That guy is very good. He's on point, shitting on people. Yeah. And being smug about it and being all serious.  If you look at a lot of where he stands politically is not he's not like a corporate right wing guy. I mean, listen, he's wealthy. He's from a rich family, blah, blah, blah. But he actually seems to like find a lot of merit in some of the more socialist type programs.  Like he talks about, he balances his statements and balanced them out. And like, you'll you'll watch him and you'll go, this guy doesn't seem like some radical lunatic, but he's in that category where he's everyone's like, oh, he's a white supremacist, always a racist.  You don't even give him a chance that nobody wants to. But this is this is how partisan we are, how politically divided we are when nobody wants to listen to anything that anybody says that even doesn't even agree with them at all. Right. There's a great fucking documentary from a few years back about the 1960s. And it is I think it's called Bitter Enemies.  It's I've talked about it before. It's Gore Vidal versus William F. Buckley.  Yeah. Best of enemies. Best of enemies SSME.  Yeah, it's amazing. Unbelievable. It's so good. Yeah. And you have this conservative and William F. Buckley who really seems like a cunt, and you got Gore Vidal who's like my version of what a liberal should be.  That's what I like. Right. An intelligent, open minded, very well read, very articulate person.  Right. I love that debate because.  And then when Gore Vidal gets under William F. Buckley skin and he says crazy shit to him and he says, yeah, he says, I'll sock you some real fairy or something.  He calls him, but it's very dated, like you'll stay plastered or something.  I'll sock you in time. Yeah, yeah, yeah. New political cartoon fight. Yes. But he was like obviously lost his cool and he lost the debate because of that. Now we could have a debate.  We have to hide the location because there would be riots outside. Yeah, yeah. Oh yeah. Yeah. Everybody would be hit line. Yeah, yeah. Because they'd be shooting fireworks into the debate stage.  You can't even have a remotely controversial non orthodox opinion anymore. Yeah.  And and I hate to say this because I am a left wing person. Yeah, it is.  From the left, right and left are the people that are doing this.  For the most part, the right might they might mock people on the left, but they're not trying to shut down speech.  The right is not. Well, the right. Used to do it, they did it a lot in the 90s, they did it a lot with art, they did a lot with people that were anti religion. They did it a lot like the family values Catholic. All those coalitions used to do it a lot. They used to do it a lot when a cartoon did something they didn't like.  The left did that, too, though. Dude, you know, Tipper Gore was the one who was trying to stop the rot. Absolutely. But she was Gore's wife, one hundred percent. But she was kind of an anomaly at that point. It was a lot of us come to the Christian right. But now all of that has been transferred to the left. Yeah, that's why it's so confused.  Primarily, it's transferred to the left was supposed to be about like, you know, tolerance.  Yeah, open minded views. I remember there was a I forget the artist's name, but he had a piece called Piss Christ. And it was you remember that it was during Giuliani.  Yes. Yes, I remember it. Yeah. It came to Boston because I remember it was a crucifix submerged in urine.  That's there is this Endris, Andres Serrano. It's a small plastic crucifix submerged in a glass tank filled with piss with his own piss. And people were losing their fucking minds that this guy dumped a plastic statue in a bucket of piss, like pawning it off. Yeah.  And it was like there was like civil war about this is a real big issue. Yeah.  And I want to say I'm not look at the date here. Bonuses is like eighty seven.  Well, five. Eighty five. Eighty five. Yeah.  He was probably just as bad I yeah I would. This was post high school for me and I was still trying to figure out what made sense.  Yeah. I was, I was like I was first I was just getting so eighty seven means I was twenty which means I was just getting out of the house, I was just getting out of the house and I was twenty and I was living with my friends and I was kind of a loser who was also a winner like was a martial arts winner. But I was a loser. As far as like if you looked at me on paper. Yeah.  What do you do with your life, kid? Like, oh, no problem.  Yeah, it was a problem. And I was trying to figure out what made sense. And I heard about this and I went to see it.  And I also went to see Yoko Ono art exhibit, one of the one of the Yoko Ono art pieces, Yoko Ono. This was she had a block of wood was nails in it, and there was a box of nails and a hammer. And she encouraged people to participate in the art like she wanted you to pick up a nail and knock it into the wood. Wow. That was that was her art. She's like, I want to encourage participation.  And so I had a bit about it back then. I was like, if you want to encourage participation, take the nail.  Put it on your forehead. A fucking liar on my blog. Well, they got it. Yeah, this is when I was an open microphone. Yeah, that makes you look at that.  And it's so bad. But certain comedy specials will be remembered like that. Oh, yeah. Certain things, certain comedy special. They'll be like, oh, that was our nail moment.  Yeah. Don't try that.  We've already figured out the art form. You don't need to reinvent it when no audience we do it. Yeah. There's no need the.  Yeah. I mean it's crazy now everybody and this is probably you know, this is probably overinflated. All that Spotify stuff is it's just complete fodder.  They have literally said nothing to me about it. Zero rights never come up. Now, is there someone at Spotify that is complaining about the Abigael Schreier episode? I'm sure, right. I'm sure that someone is complaining about it. Is it a transphobia episode? It's not the wrong there not is nothing to do with that. It has to do with the fact that human beings are actually malleable. We all know that that's why cults exist. Right. There's a there's a thought process now that if you're talking at all about trans people, you have to be 100 percent supportive.  You can never question whether or not children should be allowed to transition babies, hormone blockers for prepubescent children. All this is madness like it. Here's the question. Are there some people who are horribly sad that they trans that they transitioned and regret it terribly?  The answer is yes. Right. Are there some people that are very happy? They transitioned and they're much more happy in the gender of their choice, how they feel than the gender of their birth? The answer is also yes. Right. Because people are they vary wildly. What she's talking about, Abigail's talking about in her book, Irreversible Damages, large clusters of kids who are mostly kids that are socially awkward. Many of them are autistic. Many of them have never had any praise at all in their life.  And they transition and they get all this praise from people. Right, because it is right now, it's in vogue.  It's a social contagion amongst that subset of people. And they're they're at high risk for they're easily influenced. And, yes, that was the problem.  The word contagion was one of the things they had an issue with. It called it deeply transphobia.  It's not trans is contagion is also used to talk about diseases. So that's. But that's not.  But but so, yeah, it is language. And this is the problem is that they look at this and they say this is openly transphobia. It is not trans phobic. It's not trans phobic.  No, it's not. I think there's got to be space for conversation.  And I think that a lot of this, you know, rigid, you know, allegiance to I mean, listen, we all know that trans people are in many cases are much happier when they transition and they have better, productive, fulfilling lives.  Everybody I don't think anybody like there are people that don't want that, but they're probably a minority.  But here's hopefully a small minority spectrum of human beings in their happiness is so fucking broad. Yeah. That to say that all heterosexual people are happy or a homosexual people are happy or all trans people are happy is nonsense.  Not true. It's crazy. Right. So when you talk about a particular issue where the uptick of girls transitioning, it's called rapid onset gender dysphoria is psychological. Psychologists are talking about this like it's a real issue because there's an uptick of several thousand percent over the last decade. They're looking at this. They're trying to figure out what the fuck is going on. Right.  So when that does happen, yeah, if you can't discuss it, you you we've found ourselves in this terrible place where there's no longer nuance, there's no longer informed discussion.  And you have decided that a subject is off bounds or out of boundaries.  Now, if people think that I should have trans people on and talk to them about it, I'm happy to do that. Right. But that's not what they're saying right now. I don't know what the actual conversation has been from Spotify talking to these employees, but if these employees are listening, I would tell you emphatically, I am not in any way anti trans, not in any way, in any way.  I am one hundred percent for people being able to do whatever they want, as long as it doesn't harm other people. If you choose to do anything, whatever you want, whatever your personal choices, I'm happy. If you're happy, I don't care. I'm of course one hundred percent open minded.  But if you say that I can't talk about something.  When a woman wrote a whole book and researched it deeply and is talking about not not just these children themselves that have grown up and then gotten out of school and then realized they've made a horrible mistake and it's irreversible. That's the name of the book, Irreversible Damage.  We can't discuss this. Look, I had a friend who reached out to me and was saying thank you because my daughter has friends and four of them just decided they're trans together and they're all awkward. And I've been trying to tell her that this is probably statistically not even possible, that they would all be trans. So this is there might be something else. And then they read this book or they hear about this conversation and without any.  Looking into it, they just decided that it's trans phobic, it it's not trans phobic to say that some people will regret transitioning. It's just a part of being a person. People look, people are so malleable, they're so easily influenced.  And for us to die, that doesn't do anybody any any good anybody any service.  So this is the main issue they had with that. You know, this is apparently this is the main problem they had was this one particular episode. And I'm sure they've had issues with other episodes as well.  But like I said before, like I'm talking off the top of my head and a lot of times I'm saying shit that I don't even mean because I'm saying it because this is a fucking podcast. And if you have a problem with people saying terrible shit, you work for Spotify, maybe you should listen to some of the lyrics.  Right, OK, because some of the lyrics and some of the fucking music that you guys play over and over and over again makes my shit pale in comparison.  Pale, right? If you're listening to some rap music right now. Yeah, I'm not anti rap. I love rap music. I'm fucking say it all to it. You go back and listen to NWA, right. Go go back and listen to some of the early shit. Right. And go back and listen to it. Cop killer when the body count your days, right.  Yes. Well yeah. A lot of rap is not female fault. Oh yes.  And I'm a fan man. I fucking love rap music. I'm a I'm a big fan. Look, I met Willie D from the Ghetto Boys recently when I was there. I did gigs in Houston. I was a little kid in a candy store. Right. I'm a huge ghetto boys fan.  I love rap music, but it's it's a standard. We're going to play a standard.  It is a type of art and talking shit is also type of art. You might not like that type of art because it seems too much like a real statement. Right? Sometimes it is a real statement and sometimes it's just talking shit.  Yeah, but just fun is in deciphering which is which and writes, I mean, half the fucking time you and I are talking.  Yeah. If you took what we say it out of quote, which is one of the things they did with the Bernie Sanders thing, we took things and put them in quotes and some of them were so ridiculous. Yeah.  But that that is what people do when they try to discredit someone.  And it's what they're doing is they're they're not being honest. This is not it's not an honest take. It's not a it's not a real honest take on who a human being is.  This denial of nuance.  It's a denial of all the complexities that make a human being. It's like deciding like you said this and you said Meghan McCain. Right. So, you know, fuck these tits, right?  She fuck you're a bad person. You're a bad person. I mean, she had a baby with her dad.  It's certainly possible that it may be that this is I get it if you're a 23 year old kid. Yeah. And you know, you're working for this company, you think you're going to put your foot down.  Well, isn't it just in the beginning attack everybody that got into attack? It was like nerds. It was the people that are like, right. But here's me on the outside reading these fucking articles. Yeah. Like, oh, my God. Spotify censoring rogard. Spotify is doing this, but it's not how Spotify has said nothing.  Listen to me. Nothing. I haven't said anything to my manager. You haven't said anything to me. They've said nothing. Right.  They've apparently had meetings, but they have a lot of meetings. They have meetings about all sorts of shows. They have meetings about the music. They have they have meetings about they have people that have problems, especially in this day and age. Look, it's a great company. They're open minded. They treat their employees very well. They let them have discussions about things. And I don't know what these discussions are like. I don't know what happens.  I really don't. But in terms of like them silencing me zero, right? There's been nothing. Right? There's been nothing. Yeah. And then.  Well, the new thing was Roe v Wade. Right. With the new Supreme Court justice. This is a big deal. What it was always interested me about lady has like eighty kids. She once got a lot of children and that's why she's a Catholic woman who likes being on her back and God love her and she's a smart judge. Spread that seed.  She loves she loves Christ and her husband and babies and babies and she's adopted. Some of them are adopted. Yeah. She brought them in. She flew them in.  Listen, this you know, God bless her. Yeah. Abortion is a fucking it's a weird, weird one. You know why? Because it's a it's a particularly human subject, right.  Where it's like a messy one where like I'm 100 percent in favor for a woman having a right to choose. Let's just get out of the way right away. I'm 100 percent pro-choice. Right.  But when it's like nine months old. Like what age?  Six months. I'm alive. Yeah, I'm in favor of abortion for months, up until eighteen years old, up until up until they start attending meetings of Spotify and complaining.  That's when I think you should be able to board your kids.  But anybody who says you are anti-abortion. Yeah. OK, like OK. What if it's two cells. Right.  What if the process is people that are against stem cell research, they're against any type of, you know, contraception in many cases, maybe not.  But let's generalize. Yeah, no, but they are a lot of people, people that are hardcore anti-abortion are like we shouldn't be doing anything right.  Condoms are no good. Birth control is are crazy.  You know, they're crazy. Those people are crazy.  They're wild. But, you know, also the late term abortion people are crazy.  Those are crazy people. That's a big. That is, if that baby's alive, if you took it out of the body, it would be alive. That's crazy. That's a weird one, man.  It's very strange, but people will take a hard line ideology party stance like I am left wing. I believe in abortion rights no matter what.  And if you say up to eight months, what do you think about eight months when you think about nine?  Can't do that. Can't do that. It's what some people believe in that.  Yeah.  And it's just it's it's such a human issue because it's it's so there's so many things going on there.  Roe v. Wade, if it's overturned, goes to the states have really possible I guess it's not really possible. I mean, it could be theoretically to make women carry rape babies.  I don't know. But here's what would happen. I think it would go back to the states. Right. It was it wouldn't be a ban on abortion. It would just make it a states rights decision. So there would be abortion. And still, most Americans, which again, I don't agree with, I think it should be available in all 50 states. I think those people want to cut off federal funding. Any type of federal funding.  Is it available in every state right now? I believe so, yes. Federally it has to be.  I believe so, yes. Yeah. That is what Roe v. Wade stands for.  So what happens is if they get rid of that, then states would vote on it and states would decide what the appropriate they would have to make their laws.  See, the problem is, what if there's an 18 year old girl on abortion? The United States is legal, 73 case abortions legal in all states. Every state has at least one abortion clinic. There you go. All right.  But here's the thing. Like, if you're if you make it the states rights and the girl just turns 18, the law comes into place and all abortion gets shut down. She doesn't have any money. She's fine. She's fucked. She's she's pregnant. She must know what to do.  And also, if she's too poor. Right. It's out of the state where you can get an abortion. Right. Which she might never be able to go to with in her state. It's far away.  Exactly. It's very tough, it's tough, I mean, it's one of those issues where I think that we're never going to have everyone on the same page.  We just have to realize that there's issues in America. We're not we're never going to come together. We're never going to come together 100 percent on that. Yeah, as long as you still have people with a very kind of religious view of when life begins.  Yeah, because you can't argue with somebody who says if life begins the minute that you have conception, then stem cell research, which is very beneficial to people.  The good news is that stem cell research is advanced to the point where they don't have to do that. Well, the good news is to people I think are getting smarter and realizing that they can't legislate things based on a book that was written two thousand years or whatever. I mean, you hope that that's the case. But now, you know, we have now they're legislating from you know, they're writing the books as they're writing the new religions as we speak.  So this lady that Trump wants to Amy, call me Barry. What is her deal? Catholic judge only been a judge for three years like I got. Yeah, but it's I think she's only on the district court for three years or something.  She's he want he likes her. She's a traditionalist Catholic. The anti-abortion people dig her. I mean, although Ann Coulter doesn't think she's conservative enough. So it was like it's a weird mix out there of like she's a woman.  So it's very tough for people to say, well, they are slamming her now. They're slamming her because she has two black kids, which is pretty disgusting that she adopted from Africa, which is pretty heinous that they're they're writing all these things about, oh, she's still a racist or let me to. And it's like you're going at her family.  It's so grotesque that, yeah, they're doing heinous. It's it's grotesque. She's she's obviously if she's got that many kids, she's obviously a person who cares about children, cares about you.  She's not like this is what I don't understand. I don't understand why you're trying to make this woman into a monster.  But what they're you can't help it because they want someone. First of all, they want Biden to win and they want someone to come in that's going to be nominated by oh, my, my, my, my.  Over is a great joke about that.  This guy, Dan Carney, he basically says that, like I was he basically said he's like Biden's getting lowered into the ground a day after the inauguration. He's got three weeks.  It's President Komala. You're voting for Comolli. You really. So he made a good point there. So it's like Biden's like Biden's going to spend a few months in the Oval Office, couple of photo ops and then Kamala's getting in and you're going to jail.  Yeah, he just wants to get it on the books.  Yeah, I one. Yeah, I really did it. And then faceplant. Done. Yeah. Balcom hardwood floors.  Kamala's coming in and then everybody. Yeah. And then she's going to ask Queensway all over and lock us up you know. So what. Maybe we need that. Maybe we all need to go to jail. I'm open.  Maybe that's the only way we turn this country around. Maybe I'll be able to go so far. Crazy people on the left. Yeah. We come back to the middle. Maybe like everyone's so angry at Trump, it'd be a good time to take the trade.  Crazy train left people in jail than Trump. Oh, she would.  Yeah, she has. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. No, that withholds evidence. Oh yeah. Shady prosecutor. Oh yeah.  People in jail after they were supposed to be released to use them as cheap labor for the state to wildfires.  I've heard one good thing recently is that she's into decriminalizing marijuana.  I'm done for you, baby. Do it. Come on, come on. Come on. She's coming around and she'll be vice president.  She'll be in criminalizing tweets. She's the hottest vice president. She'll be into criminalizing Facebook statuses. You think so?  No. Who knows? I get really worried about what could happen with big tech if they're if they just, you know, are allowed to run amuck, run amok.  Well, what's a Trump hasn't done anything to stop them. Nothing. What has he done now?  I don't know what we can do now. I think he did a very anemic, weak thing where he was like, you can now try to try to institute some appeals process if you get the platform, but it doesn't have any teeth. These are private companies. They can do what they want. So the real debate is like, are they public utilities? Are they private companies? I don't know the answer to that. I'm not smart enough to figure out the pros and cons of either.  But I just know that when you have such a small three or four companies, these motherfuckers have more power than Carnegie, Rockefeller, all of the people. I mean, these people have access to your thoughts.  Look at this. Trump judge blocks Trump's administration's ban on new tock downloads from U.S. app stores. Tried to do that.  He overstepped the authority with tick tock, Ben. But the tick tock thing is slightly different because we're not talking about tick tock banning anybody. Tick tock. We'll take anybody. They're not banning anybody.  Right, with tick tock until it's a low bar.  They are they are taking information from you in an astonishing rate. Yes. Like they had an engineer back, engineer the software and he said this is the worst violation of privacy features I've ever seen ever in any application. Right. It's like it's maddening. It's crazy. It's following you. Well, let me ask a question. If they looked at US companies, aren't they doing it? And I'm not saying that our China should have our information, but like.  Aren't Google and Facebook, aren't they? This is one thing. This is one step up for Apple and I'm very happy that Apple did this. Apple just stepped up recently and now Apple is going to make it so that you have to pull this up, because I don't want to I don't want to put you this because this is actually pretty important. There's Facebook is furious about this because you will it will limit the amount of ads like you have to sign off on whether or not they can sell your data.  OK, whereas Facebook saying this is going to cut our money in half, like if you give people the option, you say, do you want to?  Do you want Facebook to be able to sell your data? You know, like fuck. Yeah, sell it. Right. No one's going to say that. Most people if you have to click yes or no, they're going to say no.  But we believe them that that's the only way they're getting our data. Look at this app. Ad tracking iOS 14 will give users the option to decline app ad tracking.  But no, it's not the only way. But this is a big D is a big step.  So scroll up, please. So a new version of iOS wouldn't be the same without a bunch of security and privacy updates. Apple on Monday announced a ton of new features, a bacon iOS 14 expected out later this year with the release of new iPhones and iPads that will use it will allow users to share your approximate location with apps instead of your precise location.  It allow apps to take a rough location of your identifying precisely where you are. Another option users will have is when they give over their location. OK, but I want the. Oh, wait a minute, Cameron Mike recording here is a it will also get a camera and microphone recording indicator on the status bar. Oh my God. Is that what that light is then. Someone's been recording me all day long.  Shit. This is what I mean. I'm Popson. I usually do the comp there. They're just recording. This is what I mean all day long. Could be motherfuckers.  I'm talking shit about people too because like pops up I guess, um, how about I would like permission to track you across apps and websites owned by other companies. Wow.  I just think that yeah. Obviously opt out but I just think it's like data has become what it's, they say more valuable than oil. I mean, they're going to find a way to harvest that data from you, whether you're consenting.  I know if that's the case, they have up until now.  But if if Apple can figure out a way because it doesn't benefit them, here's what these apps harvest the data.  What it benefits them is if the apps give them a piece of the pie when you sign up and there's some apps that now are requiring subscription on their website, they'll probably just start giving people a better deal on certain things if they share their data.  I mean, that that will enable people to go, hey, I want to save a few bucks. I don't care if you want to, but that's probably the direction they're going.  Well, there's a great give up these billions and billions of dollars of selling, but it's not whether or not they give up, Apple cuts them out of it and then everybody has a choice.  You can get a Google phone, get an Android phone, and then you just give away all your information for free or Apple in Tuesday's new privacy laws or privacy features. And you get to decide who tracks you. You get to decide whether or not they can use your information and sell it. You get to decide whether or not you get ads right to you.  Right. I'm all if the apple does, that will commit to them forever.  This data, your data is a commodity that you never really signed off on and you didn't even realize, look, there's benefits to it, right? Like if your phone knows how much how many minutes it takes for you to get home, you just look at your phone, says Tim, you'll be home in twenty two minutes.  Oh, OK.  Great. Right. But how does it know that? Because it's tracking you. Right.  If your phone knows what you like and where you're going or what's on your calendar, there's certain conveniences to it tracking you.  Right. And there's a trade off for that is that you lose all, you know, privacy. Yeah. Yeah.  But the trade off that's positive is like, say, if you go to a website and it recommends you an ad and the ad is like some things you're into. Right. You know, maybe you've been looking for a nice yeti tumbler and it recommends it.  I go, I think all of it ends up being OK if you always trusted the government, if you always trusted the federal government. But it's not the government. Well, but this is companies. Yeah, but there's government people that are using that information. But that is not the real problem.  The real problem is government is companies rather like Facebook are literally making hundreds of billions of dollars off of your data. Right. And you like what are you providing? You're providing a way to get addicted that I'm just arguing with my grandma about people.  They want to keep you on the needle. That's what they want.  But there's an argument to be made that this is a commodity that no one knew was a commodity until it was too late.  Right. Yeah, and it was the cat was already out of the bag. Yeah, it's it's too big. It's it's a big thing. It's a big thing. Yeah, it's a gigantic thing.  And if a company comes along like Apple and says, you know what, you shouldn't be allowed to do this, we're going to make it like if you want to give away your privacy, right, you should have a little box. You check on every little app that you saw. And then if that comes along, I will be a fucking loyal Apple customer for life.  I just think whether it's the government or whether it's private corporations, the whole fear here is that malevolent forces are bad actors.  Get hold of this data, right? Do they do?  And so that is the major problem, whether it's intelligence agencies, whether they're keeping tabs on you for a reason.  You know, Snowden uses signal, right? You know what that is?  I don't know what it is. It's listen, I is far more secure than it seems. Right? Right. But I am iOS. Whether it's I message, my message is more secure than SMS. If you have a Google phone, unless you're using WhatsApp, you're sending a regular text message. What does this speak freely signal? This is what Snowden recommends. And the thing about it is it's encrypted you to me and it doesn't go to a third party.  So IOW, if you have an AI message, it goes to the Apple server signal does not.  OK, so signals if you and I are making sending messages to each other on signalling to the right and you could set it so that your message self-destruct in two minutes. Wow. Yeah. There's, there's different things you can do but it's not going somewhere else where someone else can intercept it. It's all encrypted. Right. SMS which you have if you have an Android phone. I have an Android phone and I have an idea. I have an iPhone.  My iPhone is a message, but occasionally, like the green text message, those green text messages anybody can pick up.  And they're also discussing on the phone, they call it it's vomit.  They don't look that bad when you have the night and mode on. No, they didn't mind them. Why do you have an android? Is it to fill with the poor people, if you like? I like to have both operating systems because, look, this isn't like that, but I like that.  Green Temple has an android. He says for Android.  I was I look at that green and I, I'm reminded of sewage.  I'm running off golfing. Yeah, OK. Maybe a nice pool table. Green green cloth. Yeah.  Oh I, I was is more secure.  It's more secure in that regard. Like imasu just more secure. The thing about my message, the superior, there's a couple of things. One, the big one is pictures.  If you send me a picture and I message, it's a big high resolution picture. If you send me a video, it's a nice high resolution video and you could send it to me through airdrop. And it's like in perfect quality, right?  If you send me a fucking video through a Google phone, it comes out looking like a flip phone from the late 90s.  Right. It's so bad. Yeah, I've sent it to people.  I'm like, oh my God, I have a one of them notes, a Galaxy Note. It's a beautiful phone.  It's like beautiful screen, high resolution. The camera. The video's amazing. Yeah. But if I text it to somebody, it's bad.  It looks fucking gorgeous.  Galaxy cameras, like a lot of Android cameras, are better than iPhone cameras. They're not better. They're just great. They're very good. They're really good. But so is this.  They're real. Everything's great now. They're all great. Sony makes ridiculously good cameras on their phones.  They have an Xperia I think it's an experience to one or one, too.  I think it's called I forget what it is, but they have, like, amazing video stabilization and all these different like their cameras are off the charts.  And if you're a photographer, the Sony ones allow you to get in there and tweak shit. And so the Samsung ones, you could do a lot of tweaking and fucking with the settings. And Samsung has incredible zoom like they have this Galaxy s twenty ultra and it has this crazy zoom on it, man.  Yeah, you can show movies on a lot of those.  And the iPhone and the Galaxy also has a 5000 milah AMP battery. So it's like the battery lasts you forever, but you're still sending text messages. They haven't figured out an encrypted version of a messenger. So unless you have friends, you got to talk them into getting WhatsApp or you got to talk them in using signal. It's like, why can't they get that shit together? And they don't even have an ability to transfer data like like you can't send me a picture through Bluetooth.  Like if you have an Android phone and I have an iPhone, you can't send me a picture. Not native at least. I mean, there might be applications that are after the fact now. Yeah, they're just not quite there yet.  They're not there yet. But I still feel like it's just, you know, it's a system of control that is going to be more and more omnipresent. Here's the other thing I should say.  When I have my Samsung phone, my text are not green. I can make my text any color I want. OK, it's totally customizable.  I like just on my phone only ever texting me. I've only ever seen the green ones.  You've only seen them come to you, correct? That's because I message they they make you look like shit. You send a green text, they know people hate it, they know comics like you make comments about how poor you love. I mean, it's disgusting. Yeah, it's just it's weird that Google hasn't figured that out, that Android hasn't figured out a way to make a version of, like, a message that works on a message. It's like, I guess Apple has it locked down.  They want it locked down. Yeah, that seems to be what they want. They want you and now they want you in their walled garden.  That seems to be the issue now is that you can't do anything without being in business with some of these companies, whether it's Facebook, YouTube, Google, Amazon, like you have those five companies that run tech. You got to be in business with them.  If you want anything, you got to be on the grid. You don't really have too much of an option. And now they're instituting this thing saying, oh, well, you can you know, you can opt out of the data, but I guarantee they find a workaround with that profile and a workaround and that that's the real issue.  And then you start thinking about like what now they want they want to get rid of cars. They want everybody to be in fleets of self-driving cars. This is something that people want. I mean, Gavin Newsom has said, let's phase out cars by twenty thirty five.  Well, he said phase out gasoline cars. Well, of course, gasoline cars. But he's a fucking idiot. The fact that they're doing this in the middle of like their education system is falling apart.  These poor kids were getting a terrible education before their top priority should be fixing their education system instead.  Yeah. How much time are they wasting putting together this thing, this virtue signalling thing where you're trying to make banned cars, that new cars that are gasoline cars by 2010?  Well, yeah, their whole argument is now that the fires are here and people realize that it's a problem, blah, blah, blah. That's true. There's a political will.  But listen, you got to fix what you haven't fixed a first agree.  You know, I mean.  Well, the other thing is, you know, they pass a carbon tax in New York City and they start Hubers started costing a lot more money.  A lot of people in New York City used Uber pools to get to work because the subway in New York, which is an old legacy system, doesn't always run efficiently.  So people that were going to work in Uber and especially the pool pool feature, it was very cheap. They instituted a carbon tax and a congestion tax. All of a sudden, uber rates went up and now people were unable, couldn't afford to get to work.  So it's like, yes, you're helping the environment, but you're damning people in that respect.  Here's my favorite thing. They just passed. They're allowing transgender inmates to go to the prison of the gender they choose. So violent male sex offenders who decide that they're trans can go to women's prisons.  That's going to work out well. There's no way that's going to be bad. No, no.  This is that Bridget Fantasy sent me a thread on Twitter where this this journalist goes over all of the issues that they've had with people turning trans in Canada and doing this and all the horrible people that have gotten into female prisons using it and the difference between female prisons and male prisons about how much more violent male prisons are and how horrifically our female prisons violent, barely.  Well, that's disappointing.  Yeah, they I see some of the women going in there and I would like to believe that they are that they're violent.  I think some of them are not violent. Damn it.  I think I just want equality, Joe. Well, I just want your violence. Yeah. I just want equality of violence. It's not going to happen.  I want women out there beating the shit out of each other, throwing each other mostly pillow fights.  Yeah, they're in their underwear. They're just talking shit about each other, just waiting for guys come and fuck them. Yeah. So that's girls prisoners.  Just pillow fights and cattiness.  It's all only fans. Yes. What percentage is only. Fans groan during the massively. Well everyone's become a whore. I mean, everyone, people that were one or two steps, I didn't know how many people were one step away from legitimate prosecution, I, I have told several of my friends that are better looking to me be a whore, like do it because there's no jobs.  Christina Brzezinski was explaining this to me. Yeah. Her and Tom are moving out here, by the way. Yeah. And they were out here the other day. We went to dinner and she was telling me that Aaron Carter is his name, the the singer with the tattoos on his face as a little meth, got only fans account and he jerks off in front of people.  Well, listen, it makes a lot of money. Good for him. His career has been not great.  She said it in front of my kids, though. She's like, Jane is dead. That's what she said to my kids. Yeah. So he's Jane is dead. Yeah. On only fans. And I'm like, well, no one knows what that means.  Well, I mean, it is it's one of the only jobs left.  It's 12 year olds. Isolate novitiates. Listen, it's you're either a cam girl or you're instigating a race war. Those are the jobs. Those are your two jobs in America.  There it is. Oh, Aaron Carter is now doing porn. Former child pop star recently joined Camusso, the same shit.  So he was a former defense tatoos child pop star. Well, they're real new. Yeah, Aaron.  I mean, these face tattoos, I mean, you see everybody in L.A. with them. A lot of these young girls have them. Yeah, a lot. Well, not everyone, but a lot of these kids in L.A. have them and they just OKC had and only fans.  His brother was in the Backstreet Boys. Can you not do porn on only fans? There can be whatever you want really.  But most people use it for 27 bucks a month. Look at him holding it back. Yeah, yeah.  People really people get on only fans because they want a reasoned discourse.  Well what was it. Seventy two bucks. Oh for three months. What is the most a gal can charge.  You can get a lot. And I've seen people then explaining how this whole system works for them. And like they have a whole it's not a pyramid scheme. But like if I got you guys to both sign up for a certain amount of time, I get shares of your money to Y like incentives for Grohe.  It's a it's a pleasure. You got a bunch of his other buddies, a jailer D in front of people you ever got him. That's what pimp.  That's what pimps used to say to hookers. They find a few of your friends. Yes. This is just Lane Maxwell. There's no difference.  One hundred twenty. Yeah. You feel like. Wow, how many fans does he have. Doesn't tell you that part. I guess private and details keep private. Not safe for work on two hundred twelve hundred.  That's it. I mean this is a I don't know if this is better than doing cameo.  OK, well let's thank you for doing it's not cameos.  So he's basically making somewhere in the neighborhood of 30 grand a month Jane. Deal. I sure. Twelve hundred two point twenty seven but not bad. It's not bad.  It's better than working. Listen, if he had to work a job and he had that thing on his face and people, you think, Oh, Jesus d for twenty seven months, you get mad.  Go back to doing that shot up. I'm just trying to work.  But it's amazing how that during the pandemic is because everyone's home, nobody's doing anything. I guess everybody is just jerking off. He also sings and plays guitar in the nude. Oh no dancing. Thank goodness. Other sultry activities that I love.  He's playing guitar in the nude. He's still trying to hold on to it, you know what I mean? Like, he's like I got a new song and everyone's like, Buddy, let me see your asshole. Yeah, that's not what this is. Spread your cheeks. He's like I wrote this about. Yeah, no one.  Can you fit the neck in your asshole, please. I paid money, I paid American money to be very disappointing to pay for his only fans and then he's strumming a guitar.  Maybe the music's really good. It's not. How do you know. I'm guessing it's not. Yo, he throws a fit in court after ordered to forfeit guns.  Five hundred of them he was forced to.  Oh my God. A result of his sister. What does it say? Scrollbar sister winning a restraining order case. Oh well, that's not good.  He's threatening a lot of these people that get famous, very young. It's a very rough it's a rough road. It is unmanageable. Yeah. I don't know anybody who's managed it. Yeah. Miley Cyrus was on the podcast a couple of weeks ago and I told her, I said, you you've done it about as good as you could do it. Right.  She's a she's got a lot of barriers up, though. You tell you could tell she's been through it. You can't get that famous, that young.  She's twelve years old, playing arenas. How the fuck. It's crazy. Yeah man. I mean I just who. And it was funny her talking about on the show. That was it.  Her mom or grandma was saying, well it's better than her being in L.A. doing drugs like once.  Right. Yeah. Why is that the choice. Like what are you to or better than being back home doing drugs.  Well, I guess they felt like this is her ticket out of the life of. But her show was never going to be her life. Her dad was a famous country music star.  Her voice is so harsh. She's got a great she's she's a phenomenal talent. Oh, my God, she's amazing. I mean, her talking voice is so harsh. Yeah.  Sounds like mine a little. It's rougher. Wow. Oh, yeah. Oh yes. And mine want to play it.  Let's play some of it. Play some of her. Play some. Listen and by the way, I should say is I'm not knocking her. I'm a fan.  And that's what people like Spotify music put my service on. No, I fucking love Miley Cyrus. Right? I really do.  I'm a giant, I think exactly what it stands for. Oh, my Jesus Christ, she's forty five.  You're always kind of like an x ray and it kind of shows you almost like in those thermal type colors of the activity of your brain. There we go.  So she had an operation on her throat. She had like and she still saying, was it polyps? Oh yeah. Let's kill.  Right. Yeah, great. Well that's good dude. I listen to her music. Before I told her this, I played I showed her an image of me before I fell my Netflix special. I was listening her song Malibu and like dancing around backstage. Wow. Gets my mind off of. Yeah.  What kind of do. Yeah. I'm just trying to lose myself. Yeah. And I've been a big fan of hers for a long time.  I think she's fucking super talented man. Her voice is beautiful. Yeah.  Yeah. Have you ever heard her cover of Joleen's. Amazing. I mean it's great.  It's so good. Let's hope, let's hope she's not on all the fans and Cheggers vocal cord surgery will require weeks of silence to recover.  And this was in twenty nineteen. Yeah.  All we need Trump to do is like I was going to say a vocal cord surgery, but it's his biggest thing as Twitter. So it doesn't matter. You can't I mean you couldn't.  That's what's great about Donald Trump. He could lose his voice and it wouldn't matter. He could still inflame people with just his fingers. Yeah. Cut his hands.  It maybe even be better if he had one of those. Yeah. Joe Biden, the debate is tomorrow night. It's right. It's crazy. Are you going to be here? You're doing a show.  I'm doing a show in San Antonio tomorrow night. There's a few tickets left, but we I just added it because I said I just want to do a show while I'm here. And everything in Austin is all recap city great club is not open.  I'm hoping we can bring it back. Wow. I'm going to bring this I'm going to open up a club here. I don't give a shit. I'm just some it's a lot of things. I'm in the middle of a lot of things. I'm working on a lot of stuff. Yeah. A lot of things happening. Yeah. But that will be one of the things that I'm going to work on that would be great. I mean, none of us know when the store is opening.  Nobody knows anything about anything in L.A..  My concern is I don't want there's a bunch of things. I don't want anybody getting sick. Of course I want to be able to do it where you know, the people who work there, waitstaff, folks can be safe and can make a living. There have been talks about promising vaccines that are they're showing promise. There's four in trial.  Yeah.  So Dorna, AstraZeneca, Johnson and Johnson is one of them. I believe that's one of them.  And then Pfizer, like, there's there's there's a few that are and I spoke to doctor who said they all seem to their safety ratings are good, but their effectiveness is that's what's going to be debatable. But he did say it's better to have safe vaccines. It may not work as well because you could always get other ones instead of ones that have all these other problems.  Oh, Jesus, Jamie. Vaccine trials after neurological. Listen, I'm glad he's telling us the you go back to IRA Carter's dick, we're trying to be positive. Jesus drug maker says it halted a coronavirus vaccine study because a woman who received the experimental shot develop severe neurological diseases.  All right. No vaccines. Sorry. Here's the thing. If it's a try, don't want the vaccine and let everyone else carrison.  There's only one person that gets that out of 100 people that are on the trial. We got to do. When you ramp that shit up to millions, though, you got thousands and thousands of people that are fucked.  Either way I feel about it is I would like everyone else to get it. The vaccine. And because don't want everyone says we need a vaccine. No one's thinking about getting it themselves.  My manager or her dad got the Lyme disease vaccine back in the desert and it gave him Lyme disease. She is.  Yeah, they stopped doing it. They stopped doing I think they deny that it gave people Lyme disease. But he got fucked up from this vaccine.  Yeah, interesting. Like, no, it's actually a coincidence. You actually got Lyme disease right before we came to you in Texas.  Sorry, we didn't mean really. Sorry, I vaccines are creepy. I've never gotten a flu vaccine. I've never gotten the flu.  I wanted to ask you this. I'm glad we brought this up. Yeah. Robert Kennedy Jr.. Yeah. Praising logit native. I go back, I would take what he says and literally think about it, I've heard him speak.  I mean, he has that disease with his voice. What's your voice? I don't know. But he has like there's some very rare diseases, I believe, with his voice.  He just doesn't like vaccines.  I mean, listen, there's a lot of credible people that not where are you going to, you know, not saying all vaccines are bad, but saying that there are real problems with certain vaccines and the amount you add and the amount of vaccines that the kids are getting, they're getting a lot of vaccines in a very short period of time.  So he was on Mike Tyson recently. Let's listen to him.  Like, you know, my grandfather and grandmother were both major. I imagine you're on Mike Tyson's hotbox.  You're high as fuck are you talking to? So that's how he talks.  Is that Chris deleted? Right. Right.  It's Chris. At least found a job. Isn't it interesting that he's he's doing Mike Tyson's show? I, I, I watched this at the end of it. He says he's not an anti Voxer. I don't think he is. I think people are clarification. But here's the read. That sort of the thing about vaccines is like the thing about all medication and basically everything. There's a certain number of people if you make things mandatory, like if you make everyone have to take a vaccine, think about there's 300 or whatever million people and most of them have been vaccinated.  You're going to have a lot of people that have problems. Right.  That's just a sheer numbers issue. Yeah, it's just going to be a big issue. And if you look at the vaccine court, like how many settlement? And by the way, I should say right away, I'm pro vaccine. I've been vaccinated. My kid's been vaccinated. Right.  But I know people who have had problems and I know people whose children have been vaccinated who said that immediately. Ron Funchess was talking about it.  And he's like, I don't know if that's what caused it, but right away my kid shut down and we noticed it like it was it was instant and we thought it would come back and never came back. He was different before. And he's not the only one that I've talked to.  So there's a there's a lot of concerns about things like that happening, but they don't know if this was something that was inevitably going to happen or if the vaccines were a catalyst, if that's, you know. But vaccine courts have paid out money to a large number of people.  Does that mean vaccines are better? Vaccines are the reason why most people think there's a yeah, there was a reason why we haven't died from fucking smallpox and syphilis and all the other disease, syphilis or the vaccine.  First of all, I don't know.  I think that four point two billion dollars has been awarded as of October 2019. Wow.  It's just one of those things that's from vaccines perhaps in court.  People know so little about it and people are very uncomfortable because a lot of the scrollable them. See what that means. No, you're right.  Well, it's scary. It was breaking it down by year. That was just so I could get you the biggest.  Oh, the overall that this is just the Wikipedia for for vaccine compensation, national vaccine injury compensation program.  That's what he was talking about, which is what he got into. He still is a lawyer and isn't like he's so fighting this fight. That's this is the thing.  It's it's not that we shouldn't vaccinate because if we didn't vaccinate all these fucking kids that are getting the mumps now and measles and all these different serious diseases, it could really fuck people up, coming back.  They're coming back because people don't want to vaccinate their kids. Right. It's fucking complicated, man, like most things that involve people, they're very complicated. Yeah, but I think that a lot of people are, you know, because with coronavirus, they are just skeptical because the whole thing has been just handled poorly and nobody knows what's going on.  And the information is so bad and nobody trusts anybody anymore. The idea that you're just going to show up to see the system is going to just shoot you in the arm with this synthetic coronavirus.  People don't people are kind of that's scary.  Something is synthetic coronavirus, whatever it is, I don't know what it is. They're called em RNA viruses. And what that is, is it's vaccines, rather RNA vaccines.  It's a vaccine that stimulates the production of certain proteins that will fight off the coronavirus.  OK, so it's not like you're getting an inert version of the virus like every other vaccine. All right. So, OK, well, now we got a whole new fucking thing. Now it's a whole other it's a whole new ones. The new thing.  Well, people are just people just are uncomfortable with any and all information being disseminated right now is just, you know, up for debate. You have people that are screaming at each other going, this is the thing. I I read an article the other day that said vaccines are on their way. The next article said there'll never be a vaccine. I don't know what to think. I'm reasonably intelligent. I don't know what to think. A lot of this country is not reasonably intelligent, so they don't necessarily like I don't blame them for being skeptical and being a little scared and going, you know what?  I'll take my chances out there. Instead of getting a shot in the arm in a Walgreens, they vaccinate you in like a shitty pharmacy.  You're buying like eggs and you get a shot and they say, good luck. And who's doing it? Somebody making minimum wage has no idea what they're doing. Like, yeah, yeah.  It's a little terrifying. Yeah. I'll take my chances.  The take, which is what coronavirus part, which I've heard ADNOC to get to conspiracy on this part. But like I've heard, too late nano getting added to RNA and vaccine stuff and there's no have Sopra add something to my blood.  Bill Gates. All right.  Well, you got UNGEI got a nano robot. I don't know what's acad or what's not a boy.  Nobody took a bigger hit during this coronavirus lockdown than Bill Gates.  Well, he became a villain. I don't think he's a villain. But I also think that, listen, we're living in a time now of Batman era villain.  Like we're like these guys have billions and billions and trillions of dollars. I don't think he's a villain. I'm not saying he's I don't think he's a villain. That's I'm not saying he's innocent.  But here's what Bill Gates has done more for humanity than most rich people would ever imagine doing.  That guy's built schools and wells and help people get educated or they look him and his his wife, the the Gates Foundation, they've done a tremendous amount of positive work. But what I'm saying is.  But he's wading into the controversial waters of the vecsey. So, listen, what I'm saying is that during this pandemic, yeah, he's become a villain for the first time ever.  He's like 70 because he wants to deliver people the mark of the beast. That's all.  That's the only reason people are upset with him is he wants to deliver people the mark of the beast. Let's extend the toxin.  But listen, when he goes, listen, you got to expect a certain amount of a certain amount of, you know, discussion when you're making when you are the guy inserting yourself into this very kind of volatile debate about public health. And you're telling people they need to be vaccinated to travel. And and these are the standards that you want people to adopt. Listen, man, he could have just been a billionaire that swam in his fucking pool.  Why do you think he talked about that? Like telling people that they need to be vaccinated?  He I guess he if you give him the benefit that he wants to help people, I guess not give him the benefit of the doubt.  OK, if we don't give him the benefit of the doubt, we'll say that he wants the world to look exactly like he thinks there's necessary and unnecessary things.  He thinks that he should be in charge of people's health, public health, or that he thinks that a group of scientists or him and his foundation should be in charge of public health to his found.  Really? No, I mean, listen, there's also billions and trillions of dollars to be made off some of these vaccines to see is he making money off vaccines?  I don't know what he's doing, but I'm telling you so much money. Why does he need more money?  Why does anyone need more money? I don't think he's doing it for money. I'm not saying he's evil. God, I'm saying that we cannot write a blank check. I feel like he's an evil God. We cannot write a blank check all the time.  We can't write a blank check to anyone.  Look at him the next apple. That's in twenty fifteen. That's when he planned it. Listen, I don't trust anybody who wears an outfit. This fucking sweater with this guy say this and I'm being totally serious.  The button shirt underneath him and Dr. Fauci created AIDS.  That's all I'll say. That's all I was saying. Why. Because, you know, people, people fucking walk around just for fun and they created AIDS.  So that's the only reason I'm a little skeptical. No, but in all seriousness. Our society shouldn't be structured where one guy stands up because, by the way, in order to travel and go places and open your businesses, here's what you need to do. And we talked about that in the beginning of the show. But the government doing it, why is it better for private billionaires doing it?  Well, here's the thing. Like, why are we listening to him talk about public health issues like jobs? He's the guy who founded Microsoft. Phenomenal question. Yeah, I mean, it's a great question.  Is it just because he's rich?  He has an interesting what if I stepped up and started telling everyone it's time to get vaccinated, everyone's got to get vaccinated? Yeah. People be like, hey, hey, hey, relax. You're a fucking comedian in a cage fighting comedy, right? Why are you telling me? That's why I tell people to vote.  So is he doing it? Well, that's why people are a little suspicious. He's stepping out of his lane now.  That sweater with the shirtless sweater, the creating of AIDS and Mark of the Beast, all of it's a prop. There was a great someone who wanted to shoot. And I've said this before the show, I want to shoot a missile dusted sun to help climate change.  I heard about that. When you have the capability, when you have the capability to do that type of shit, someone's got to check. No one's checking him. You know, why would check Bill Gates?  No, I don't trust him. Why? Because he talks shit about Tesla. Oh, did he? Yeah. Interesting.  Well, he and human war buddies, that other fraud, Warren Buffet, like, oh, I live in my little house. I've always lived in and I drink Cokes. He's a trillionaire. He's a cold blooded trillionaire. God love him. But stop with the house. Stop with. That's an act. He has a military base under the house. Stop with this fucking act. I eat Dairy Queen and all this horseshit. Europe, you've got 80 billion dollars.  Can you stop with the horse? Shit.  He lives in a small house. He drinks Coca-Cola. I'm sure it's not that small.  It's small for a guy is worth 80 billion dollars. Sure. But that those are the guys you got to watch. I want my millionaires and palaces like that. It's a nice little house. I there is living like Trump in a gold apartment.  Well, listen, he's a cheap fuck. He likes to keep the same house. I love that. What about that?  Go get a sneak peak. Go down. Jimmy Kimmel, beautiful little sneak peek. What is that? A sneak peek at Warren Buffett's watch.  There's other houses, this motherfucker, whatever. How many houses you got, Warren? Oh, let him at Gates.  You're such good friends because they're both doing this thing where they're like, we're just little old man. And I'm just saying, you go, well, everybody's got to get watched. I understand. Everybody's got to be watched by me.  You should think that people are watching when you open your trap and tell everybody they've got to get vaccinated.  People are not predisposed to trusting billionaires, delivering them edicts. I don't want an edict from anybody from the government from a billion. I don't want anyone to go. Here's what you have to do. Explain to me why. Tell me why it's beneficial. And then, by the way, even still give me the freedom to do it or not.  So here's what he said about Elon and Tesla. He was saying that this Tesla truck thing, that building semis is not likely because of the fact that the batteries are very heavy. And Ilan's like, you don't know what the fuck you're talking about already doing.  Yeah, like they're they're already deep in their five hundred mile semi trucks. Right. They're already operation. Right.  They're they're a year away from implementing them nationwide.  Right. Like they have them. Right. Have you seen a Tesla semi. Yes. Yeah. They exist. Right. So he's talking about it's not likely plainsman Tesla.  What does he saying.  This is actually well all these billionaires have egos. They'll fight each other. OK, good. What's your opinion about Bill Gates? Declarations refer to electric trucks regards. He has no clue.  Yeah, he doesn't have a clue like Elon is balls deep into that world. And then Ilan's also mad because Bill Gates bought a Porsche Tyulkin Electric Porsche.  Well, he said only after he said that Bill Gates at Elon said, I've been underwhelmed when I talk to him. Oh, that's funny.  Well, you know, the whole thing is that these guys have egos and everybody wants to just give me a little info before you put a chip in my arm, please.  There's a company that yeah, we were watching the video.  They put chips in people's arm so they could use a vending machine. Yes.  I don't think that's good enough. A lot of Americans will still go for that. Well, if they fire you, they turn a chip off today. Well, they're going to do that. I mean, they're going to do that. I mean, this is this is going to happen. I mean, you cut it out. Yeah, they well, they can deactivate you get the chip out your choices, Tim.  Yeah. Keep that chip in your arm for the rest of your life. And it's just inert. We still track you, we have to track you, right, or we'll spot check me on the way in which I thought was they told me they weren't going to do that. They just did a chip in my neck when I walked in, which, I mean, they were going to do.  I was like, OK, they will they knew that you talk shit on trains. They do.  They said, he's only I like the Republican ones. I love Caitlyn Jenner.  I love if you're a transgender person, you're against gay marriage. I'm already a fan. I think I fucked up by saying tranny.  You can say that and you can't say it, even though jannika each other tranny's think gay people call gay people faggots. But you can't say that. Don't say it. Don't say it. You can say because you're gay. Yes, but if you look past I, but I, I know I look too racist to say the my wife still doesn't believe you're gay.  She says you're just doing that just for the jokes. We had a meeting at WME and they said we've got to figure something out. And I said, I said, well can we try?  And they said, gay guy who's kind of like uncomfortable and says, like the wrong things. And and I said, well, let's try it out.  And I told my wife, who lives in Jersey with our three kids, who I send money home to every week, she's a lovely woman, slightly larger, but working on it.  And, you know, she would just make the money, you know, but well, it's just the gay in the media is like is gays become annoying now.  Yeah. Everybody everybody's annoyed because gay people like you are. You better be. And it's like shut off. Nobody was supposed to be fun. They missed the will and grace gay. They'd be gone and they've become moralists.  It takes all the fun out of it. You're not supposed to take balls out of your mouth and tell people how to live. That's really the reality.  That's the reality. They miss the Queer Eye for the straight guy type of guy.  Yeah, well, that's a fun gay. Well, yeah, because now the gays are bookish and angry and and they're in antifa and they're angry.  And it's just like it's not fun. It's you're it's supposed to be a little fun, a little dirty and naughty and wrong. That's the whole fun thing about everything. Naughty.  It's not supposed to be, you know, Norman Rockwell, like, I'm sure that you listen, you could do what you can if the family could do anything you want. But part of what is fun about being gay is that it's not like a fucking you're not sitting there like, well, you have the transgendered lot, the drag queens reading to the kids. I'm like, great, I don't care about that. But it's just like, why are you doing that?  It's horrible and not fun. Yeah. Nobody wants to read to kids in a library. Nobody.  What do you think is how do you think it's because on Twitter and social media people can say things and get like so that they make these statements and they feel like they did a good job. And making that statement, a lot of people it resonated with people are just getting people are very invested in being a victim.  So when gay people started to mainstream and you got marriage and you got this and that, there was you weren't really a victim more. So then what happened is people start saying queer and this and that, and we're very different and now we don't.  And so now, like a lot of these non binary people, with all due respect, is that a lot of these people are white women in upper middle class colleges like Wesleyan and Oberlin and and places like that who don't want to be a victim.  I mean, they don't want to be an oppressor, but they're rich white chicks. So by saying I'm non binary, you're automatically now you're not in the hierarchy of oppression anymore.  You've been victimized by a gender patriarchy that has enforced these things on you. And that might not binary. It might stick great. I have no problem. I don't care.  But I'm also might be like bellbottoms like twenty years from now. I might be like, yeah, your mother had no gender at college. She was a nun.  She used to burn down the federal courthouses in Seattle, you know, with Douglas Murray, say, about not call them the really need attention people because he makes so many people mad.  He's always just sitting there. He's the best. He's just a very large and it just says, you know, to let me say a few things and we'll be in the news in four minutes, you know, like he's brilliant.  Yeah. His book, The Madness of Crowds is fucking fantastic because he he nails it all. Yeah. All the craziness is going on.  But it's like this weird generational because like older gay people are don't understand this.  A lot of them. Oh no, they don't get it. They don't like Palm Springs.  Those gay guys, those gay guys, no one took covid less seriously than gay people that had money like they were all buff, these buff guys walking around, no masks. They took it less seriously than people that watch Infowars.  Like they were like, this is fake.  They survived HIV. They're like, we all know AIDS by lifting weights.  No one cares. We're not fucking taking care of it seriously. So this whole idea, they don't understand. They'll be very honest to God. I don't understand. What do you mean gender's not real? The whole point of my life is agendas really wasn't attracted to that gender.  Yeah, that's the whole point. Yeah. So at the end of the day, what do you mean that's not real. So I've just been an idiot forever. I just wanted to get beat up at school. Are going to have to join the gym and get public. What are we doing.  That gender's not real thing is so we're it's like space is fake.  The thing you bring up, it's the same idea, the same thing. It's it's it's sick.  We're in trouble. Who cares. No one cares. It's the other thing.  I think people are so invested that people hate them. If people care, no one cares. No one cares about your life. No cares. You want to be. Man or woman, nobody gives a shit about anything, nobody cares about anything, truly, they care about it. There's a lot of Chick fil A if their water bills paid, they don't give a shit about your life. But this idea that people are oppressing you, they're constantly invested in their hunting and behind the trees and they're coming for you.  No one gives a shit. Yes. You're a small, motivated groups of people that want to restrict your rights. But by and large, most people, they might be like, oh, that's weird.  Or, look, that's a little odd, but they're not fuming with hatred at you.  No, no, not, not. And it makes people feel powerful or worthy. Yes, yes.  I want to be hated for the right reasons. You are. Yes. And I believe I am. I think you are. I you know, I used to say I was gay on stage.  People would be shocked. Now sometimes people start clapping. You don't want that. I don't say anymore, you know what I said?  But I say Ruth Bader Ginsburg is burning in hell because I want that reaction. I'd rather that I've chosen another way to say it.  You know, it's a fun time to be bad. Yeah, it's a fun time to say ridiculous shit, because even though, like, there's a lot of blowback, there's also a lot of people that get really happy that you're doing it because there's not enough people that are pushing back.  There's not a lot of people aren't. And the people that come out to these shows, they've been having so much fun because they want this. This is what they want. Everybody wants somebody to push back and do it in a funny way everyone can enjoy.  And that's what I think we need to do.  And I want people that are free to express themselves or not. And most people are not. Yeah, most people are not. And also let Hollywood go in his crazy direction. They're going into who gives a fuck. We have all the tools to just create our own thing.  You've shown everyone that.  And it's just like people are over it. People are over what are you going to sit in a writers room and write write for some show where you see that Emmy's shit horrific.  Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel and. Yeah, and it was an Anthony Anderson. I don't know. Who was it that he was with?  I am I think that's what it was so weird.  It's weird that they that he said, yeah, this sounds good. Yeah. Yeah. You know, you're supposed to clap your Jimmy say Black Lives Matter. He says Black Lives Matter. Say it louder, Jimmy. Yeah, black clouds. And he's like like clapping. I'm like, yeah.  What are you doing? Is it a parody? I didn't know. It's a hard thing when you look at it, you're like, are they making fun of it?  There's it's weird. They're trying to make it funny. Yeah. It's just there's no audience. And they they didn't try it out in front of an audience.  Yeah. That needed work. Like I see what you were trying to do this and you got some really good writers. Yeah. To do that. But you got to take some chances. There you go. Anthony Anderson. Jimmy Kimmel looks a little uncomfortable. Yeah, it's well, I think that's part of the sketch, though, is that he's supposed to kind of look uncomfortable. That's part of the fun about it, but it's just not good.  Nobody needed someone to write something. Really, that. Yeah, something. Someone to write something really funny.  Yeah. You know, and take a risk.  It's just a comedy about some of those gray areas and there's no gray areas anymore. So that's a real big problem. That's a big problem. A big problem, especially for anything corporate.  Louis made a good point. He said that when you criticize both sides, you end up illustrating a deeper truth, which is about humanity, which is what comedy supposed to do. Yeah.  If you look at two sides and go this and nasty, you kind of try to make fun of them and you have no sacred cows or whatever, you end up illustrating something deeper about humanity, which people can learn more from and then, you know, reorient themselves in a in a productive way about any issue. Yeah, that does make sense.  And that is you have to be able to look at both sides. And in this day and age, if that's not possible.  Yeah, it's like you if you're were I should say it's not possible if you're on a corporate television show, if you're on television, if you're doing a late night talk show, look at it. You got no shot. You know, there's too many cooks in the kitchen.  The worst I mean, they're just not funny. They're very strange. They don't look at Jimmy Fallon does not look happy doing his show.  He looks like he's changed that desk. It's very strange. He's talking to Muppets. He's talking to Miss Piggy. There's Muppets singing on the show. It's dystopian strips.  They're they're running at high altitude. Yeah.  I guess just air in the room, get that kind of money. And you say to yourself, like, I just want to stay. I always wonder why those guys don't just jump ship and, like, go make a movie or do something else.  They can't make movies because none of those guys like Jimmy Fallon, they're not going to make movies or Jimmy Fallon right now.  I mean, maybe they can make a movie, but making to go do something else. The guys who make the movies are already making the movies.  Right. Right. Seth Meyers are Seth Rogen. He's making the movies.  These famous guys that are, you know, Adam Sandler, they're making movies right for you to say, I've never made any movies before, but I've been a talk show host.  I want to make a movie like that might work, but you got a gig that pays you fucking ten million a year. Why take this gig? What are you stupid? My risk it. Why risk it.  Yeah. And well, maybe I'll just do a podcast. Well what are you going to say. Wild shit on your podcast and then they're going to cancel you from your show, then you're in trouble. Your podcast doesn't make enough money yet.  You can't do it. But nobody. What's amazing is nobody leaves like allensbach. Nobody walks away. Nobody ever talks like she's got hundreds of millions.  I mean, she's got so much money, but she's back. She doesn't care. She's back. I think she wants to redeem herself. That's probably true. Like during the covid, nobody got she got taken down harder than Bill Gates. She did. So Bill Gates was like here.  She got taken down. But I think they'll forgive her.  By the way, if you were having a problem, if if you were in a car accident and you just sitting there and you want somebody to help you and you see Allen and Bill Gates, does that make anyone feel comfortable?  No, I think that would be very honest.  Like if two of them were walking towards me and I had, like, a tire out, I would fake my own death.  I just I don't something on a guttural level like, oh, she dresses like an executive on Westworld.  She's waiting for you to die. Yeah. Watching on the screen. Hmm. She's tops. I'm going to shoot him. Hmm.  See Vin Diesel song and the like. They had the crowd dancing.  Don't tell me Vin Diesel singing. Don't do it. This is this is very.  Don't you do it. It's very bad. The Emmys.  Whoo hoo! Who's that for right now. No target audience. Nobody. If you're sitting at home and you're an M.D., right.  Who we do is not the twenty seven million people they're about to be evicted. That's that's that's not who it's for. That is what's real to. Right. And that's what's real. Yeah.  I mean, they should have not had it.  I think it's for young kids in high school that want to one day be on 30 Rock, you know, or a show like that create a show like that.  Vin Diesel, this is on Kelly Clarkson show. Yes.  She's got to show people like they have screens flipped up vertically for the audience so she can see them and those people at home like they're doing for the NBA. OK, I guess Ben has a new song.  And is he singing right now?  No. You think he's talking to her? OK, wait here for the audience. We're here, so they're showing, which is the weird part, where they must have told these people they have to dance. OK, let me see what this is. Give me a little bit of it.  The bus stop stop. I heard enough. Horrible. No, not as bad as Drew Barrymore's talk show. How bad was it? Everyone said it was horrible. It doesn't even make sense. What's wrong? What is it? All of it. Yeah.  Just I don't know, like the writing. The overacting.  It's just it's confusing, man. It's like. Have you seen it, Jamie?  There was some clip I saw that I think you might have been Tom and Christina put up. It was like, not it's so bad. It's like, how did you let that slide through? Like, someone needs to tell her, like, I've heard her on talk shows, though, or she's like that.  Yeah, she's nice and she seems smart and funny and interesting on talk shows and then do on her own. She's like over the top and like really like act dowdy. Yeah. It's bad.  Oh you want to hear a little bit of it. Here we go. Pay her off her normally.  I just thought since you were closing soon anyway and I just think your bosses should actually know what an amazing person you are, that you will simply not break the rules. But then I was curious, does anyone else ever tried to find a clever way in when, like the signs say, no entry, so to speak, I love receiving a no after I've tried everything.  That's enough.  Yeah, I mean, the writers are dead. They're all dead. And this is gonna die. And they should I mean, at the end of the day, that's why you should just like it's just like podcasts, Drew.  And but she if she podcast and and just be herself. Yeah. I think it would be better be much better be better than just doing stand there.  Well she's trying to be very big and animated. No one. Yeah.  But she hasn't done standup crazy yet. You're doing standup but you haven't done another one.  He's been famous. She's two or something. Oh that's right. So I mean it's like I mean what was the eat.  She didn't eat. That was she was on. Oh. Like she's been in the business for so long ago. Yeah. That's so long ago. Yeah. I mean that's where it ends.  This is too this is a lesson for everybody in a theatre arts class right now. You could be Drew Barrymore doing that show or Aaron Carter jerking off.  Those are the two options.  Just wait until you're older. You got to develop a personality and go through some struggle and pay your own bills. I don't I just don't think it's right. It's like you and this is one of the things that I was taught.  I was a child actor as a kid. And I felt I know I was I was on Sesame Street three times. Were you really twice as I tested?  You could you could you could stuff. I did the polka with Snuffleupagus legitimately. I was a child actor and I feel I had the same voice I do now.  And it was disturbing. The casting director, I'm glad it's such a cute little kid, but I would say I would be like, hello? And they'd be like, What did you give up?  I gave I was from six first play with six, six to twelve and then twelve.  That was. Oh yeah, yeah. God you gave up before your puberty kicked in. Yeah. And then but I got out but I was you know I was in that game and was trying now you know, I would audition against people like Jonathan Taylor Thomas like real deal dudes who made it. Whose idea was it.  I really liked doing it and I was really like into it. I want it to be, you know, I wanted attention. It wanted everything.  And so my mother and father, their, you know, boomers, they're like, fine, you know, make a little money, pay our mortgage, you know what I mean? They're good.  Long Island scum. Love them both.  But, you know, so I have a friend who got famous when I was young and his parents ripped him off. Really? I found out later in life they would have done that to me, too. They would have absolutely taken everything close to. Yeah, they would have mismanaged it. Didn't audit.  Yeah, they would have through it all up, both of them. So I'm I'm glad that it didn't work out for that sake because they would have taken all the money and blown it. We wouldn't have been funny.  I'm glad it worked out because you got to go through some shit. Got to live. You got to live. You got to live.  It's just it's hard enough to be a person, just a grown person. It's everybody knows that it's hard. It's hard to be grown up. It's really hard to be famous. Right.  It's hard. It's hard to manage it. And it's way harder if you grow up famous.  Yeah. Because you never had a reality like you don't have like real people know who I am now, you know, they always know who you are, right. Well, you're fucked because it's like cement, but you're you're mixing it wrong. You get too much water and it's never going to harden. Yeah. You can't, like, take the water out. Yeah. You're pretty fucked. Yeah. That's what it's like. It's a difficult thing at your level is very difficult.  Somebody that's really well known. It can be very difficult.  I got to my level. It's kind of fun because I get a few people in a in a restaurant go, hey man. Right. That's fine. McCain. Yeah.  You were fans. We like your pocket. That's fun.  But then at your level, it gets a little invasive, it gets weird, it gets invasive.  But I had a slow drip, you know, I got it over a long time. Right. Yeah, but a slow fame drip since ninety four. Right. No.  Yeah. And then now it's just this is. Yeah. You can't go to an airport without people. It's a whole thing.  It's a thing. Yeah. It's a thing that people come up to.  I've been to the Comedy Store people, they run up to you and they're like do they just let me just show you this video.  Well they want me to do things with them. Yeah, that's what's weird. Like, I need you to help me with this project.  Let me help me with this project. Oh, dude, you'd be amazed the fucking a number of people during the day that email me or or get a hold of friends like, hey, man, I don't want to get you this, but this guy wants to talk to you about this.  Yeah. I mean, it's hundreds. Yeah, it's constant. Yeah.  Because they think that they know, hey, you know that guy. Hey. Right. I got this thing I've been trying to make this new kind of pickle.  Right. Well if I could it can you invest like you just can't hold him.  I've had no bullshit.  A thousand people ask me to invest in the weirdest way someone tried to get on the show.  Has there been, like, weird ways? I don't know, somebody FedExed himself to the studio. The beautiful thing about me not writing comments or anything like that is I don't have to read any of that. Right. And I have good people that filter out all that shit. Right?  Yeah. They've done like like Twitter campaigns. Try to like tweet erm tweet. Erm here he is. Here he is. This is me saying look at that, look at that.  I should have made it. We just had. A walk around snuffle. How did you know it was Tim? Is that you? Yeah, I mean, come on, dancing with that small Hispanic woman. Are you sure that's you? That's absolutely me. How do you know that's you? Well, I was M.K. Ultra mind control therapist and therapists have done some regression. I want to see your little face. I look different now.  So it's all from fucking bird's eye view.  Here, let me see your face. Don't see shit. I'm not buying it. Wait a minute.  You could talk to somebody. Tim, I was trying to get chubby. That is you. You could tell I was starting to get chubby. That is you.  Yeah. That's so weird. What were you thinking right there? Like, I'm really on TV. I was thinking that this is really not what I thought it was going to be. Did you meet Snuffleupagus outside of the outfit or the keep that of a big bird used to smoke cigarettes outside.  He was just really kind of a guy named Carl something.  And he looked very like who? You know, that creepy like?  Well, no, just dress, just smoking cigs and kind of like Big Bird smoke cigars in front of the kids.  Yeah. I mean, he was thin outside in Astoria, Kaufman Astoria Studios.  What years is nineteen. I was I was, you know, nine to 1994.  Wow. You could still smoke cigarettes in front of kids but call back and it was kids would just shut up. We would take my friend's mother would drive us around. You'd smoke pot. My friend's father would smoke pot and roll the windows up. Oh, that's the door. Asked us to smoke.  She would smoke Marlboro when not getting cold. Yeah. Because of you kids. Yeah, the windows go right up.  So that was when you could treat kids like, you know, garbage smoking sections in restaurants seem like such a thing of the past, but it wasn't that fucking long ago.  What year was that? I stopped doing so it must have been like two thousand and three, four, five.  So it was probably New York was earliest in New York was first. Well, L.A. was it was a big deal because they stopped it in bars. And I remember Drew Carey was complaining. They I don't think Drew Carey even smoked, but he's just complaining for the business for Barney's Beanery because they blocked it at Barney.  Everybody's like, what, Barney's Beanery?  We even have a smoking section was a little ridiculous because it just goes everywhere. Everywhere. Yeah. How could you have a sex?  I guess the world just smelled like smoke when you when you were growing up, like, all the time. Yeah, but casinos, you could still smoke. Yes.  That's what's fucked. They have certainly can you know, really, really. It's very it's frowned upon half the area. You can't like if you're at a table you can have a cigarette, but like walking around most of the places, like no smoking. But please.  No, I think they probably don't want you dropping ashes on that floor and burning the car. Part of it. Yeah, it's a lot of assholes. You walk around with cigars to Vegas and we'll fuck.  Yeah, I'm aware that might be the casino dependent. Well, the ceilings are so high and they filter the oxygen. So, I mean, do they really pump oxygen in there to keep you awake?  That's what they've said awake. But it's probably because there's it's such an enclosed space. You have to get some fresh air in there.  Yeah, I about keep you awake. Have you been since the covid. No, I've only been to Vegas for the fights and the fights are at the UFC Apex Center.  Have you stayed or do you just fly. No, I fly in and out in a day and it's weird being there man. It's like everybody's wearing a mask and they have very strict laws in Nevada, so everybody's messed up.  And yeah, I just think that that town's going to have a tough time back. They don't have a real tough time bouncing back, but if they are back, they will make money.  Yeah. Yes. Of people love Vegas. They love being there.  It's just whether or not the town itself, though my buddy Randy was telling me it's been hurt and he lives there and certain hurt and bad, he's like, it's hurting bad, like most people through their savings within the first month or two. Do you think L.A. is going to come back to you?  I don't know, Jamie. You were just there. You said it was horrible, was weird.  I just glad I was in three airports, L.A., all four technically, I guess L.A., Columbus, Austin, all pretty empty for like you would think the pandemic is happening. O'Hare Airport last night packed, slammed slam. People were running around everywhere.  People full flights, every every plane, every one of them was full there. Every flight I gone there like this is a full flight that would make me uncomfortable.  A full flight with strangers wearing a mask. I haven't done I haven't done a full flight, but I've done I've done flights. And I've got to be honest with you, you don't feel that in the plane because they're the oxygens.  It they circulate, they re filter the air. They said that the transmission rates are probably lower there than if you were in like an elevator or an enclosed small room or something like that.  It's weird how contagious diseases. Well, you say that, but I know a guy who just tested positive and his girlfriend's not positive and they've been living together so weird.  It's like is very strange.  It's weird, you know, probably healthy. Yeah. So I mean, but he's healthy too. They're both like fitness.  People should keep taking the old. She might be doing that.  I don't know. Is that, is that the is that the next roads. Maybe it's in the low. It might be anybody's.  But listen this he's he was Bill Gates comes out, says we need semen and breast milk today. Someone and the antibodies or I just take the fight, fight it.  I take the vitamin D and I think that's what you can do.  Yeah. Vitamin C and not zinc, vitamin C, vitamin E, don't eat white sugar and inflammable ice cream bullshot.  And don't you know, don't don't don't you know, try to sleep, that's hard. Oh, well, that's the thing about breast milk, too, though. Breast milk is phenomenal for a kid's immune system. There you go. Makes sense, it makes sense, but, you know, it's not nearly as big of an issue with children anyway. The one of the things the Florida governor did is you put up a chart that showed the fatality rate for people that are, you know, under this age over that age.  And he went through all the thing, which is accurate. But you're just talking about fatality.  The long term effects are creepy. Yeah, that's that's an issue.  There's some people that have, like, devastating long term effects and they don't know how long that's going to last. So obviously, this has only been around for six months, but there's people that got it four or five months ago that are still suffering from fatigue. And they're also saying that, like, that's a lot like a lot of diseases that aren't reported. Like, you know, people just have some weird neurological reaction to it and it just flares up like some type of whether it's chronic fatigue or.  Yep, I've seen barsoum.  I mean, dude, it's just a bad situation where you hope that we get out of it. But there doesn't seem to be like there's no great option here. The great option is take care of your health.  Yeah. You know, make it just that that's the option. Make sure you make your immune system as durable as possible. And there's this is what's driving me the most crazy about our government. You don't hear a peep about that. You don't hear a peep about that. Which is why, you know, I was talking on my podcast. I said as a joke. I said, tell people. It's like you're going to tell people to vote.  There's so much better advice or equally good advice, you know? Yeah. Tell them other things. And nobody tells anyone anything.  So yet they've said not a word about immune health and they've said not a word about preventative measures you can take other than sitting in your house and going broke. Yeah.  The crazy thing in L.A., they're talking about schools and when school is going to open up, they said after the election, how could you please try to pretend that you're not being this isn't totally political after the election, do you have Kamala Harris will open the schools.  She'll cut the ribbon to open the school when it's.  Yeah. Do you have science? She's going to smother Biden with a pillow.  I mean, the day she gets in now, she's got to go.  They're going to celebrate. They're going to celebrate your hotel room and she's going to get on top of them.  Now, on the vitamin D thing, I've seen all of this in the last week.  This guy's got to go. This is a big mistake. Yeah, he's been taken out. He's been saying about taking vitamin D. He says if you're deficient, the problem with that is everyone's deficient. Yeah. You know, people don't think they're deficient. Seventy nine percent of America's deficient in vitamin E.  Yeah, something about it. But Foushee just seems to me like I've always believed Italians shouldn't shouldn't be doctors and governors.  Yeah. Or governors. Correct.  They shouldn't make cars either 100 percent. But we should have a Jew or an Asian giving us advice. I like that. Nobody wants to short a foushee.  Nobody wants a fucking delivery guy giving people advice on coronavirus. Give us an Asian. Give us a Jew. Nobody wants an Irish guy either. Nobody wants a guy that looks like me was an analogy.  Kennedy nobody wants that Kennedy, Asian or a Jew, plead insanity.  Nobody want nobody. What you want a doctor or an Indian guy like a Pakistani guy? Some Indians listen to him.  Yeah, this Italian guy. I like what you're saying. I'm just. That's what it is. I think that's fair. I like when people are racist against white people.  It's like the Olean get away with it. That's all we have left. Yeah. Yeah. You get away with your shit all over them. All you have left, you know, and Italians are barely white.  That's what I'm saying. Truly, that's my show. We're Irish. We're barely white.  Well, we were slaves. We were slaves. And we were I mean, the potato famine was a tragedy. People tend not to remember that.  Oh, they gloss over the fox, the potatoes right in front of you. Yeah, right. Think about you. This was a hard time, hard time for your ancestors. I mean, but I don't know.  This debate tomorrow is going to be like it might be the funniest thing ever, I hope, and the scariest I hope it falls apart.  I hope Biden forgets what he's talking about and just fall asleep.  I hope Trump goes crazy and starts making shit up. Yeah. And I hope the United States the next day puts a time out and. Yeah, yeah. Let's start over.  Wouldn't that be amazing? Commercial free. It's an hour and a half commercial free. Wow. Who's the moderator. Chris Wallace.  I don't let me see it. I know they've announced. I think it's Chris.  It's a tick tock. Let me tell you something about that Chris Wallace guy. He is very reasonable. He's not bad. He's very reasonable. He's a good choice. He will hold your fucking nuts to the fire if you say stupid shit.  Yeah, he's good. Yeah, he he's and he's a Fox News guy, but he's he's good and even liberal. So looking at him the like, OK, it's going to be it's going to be OK.  It's going to be a really crazy debate. I'm kind of I mean I'm doing the show instead of. But I'll see, I'll watch it and I'm sure it'll be I think you can always watch it afterwards. I'll watch it afterwards. It's going to be right.  It's the election is what's scary to me. We should do last year or last in twenty sixteen. You weren't in L.A. yet, but we did the End of the World podcast.  Yeah, we should do something like that on November 3rd. They'll be hilarious.  We should get some people in here. Jamie, who do we have on.  Do we have anybody booked on. Don't tell her you don't say anything, don't say anything. Nothing. There's nothing. Don't say anything, Jamie. There might be that I know of. OK, just as election damage, you have different OK to me. I don't want the fucking Spotify people know. I got to keep the guests quiet so I can sneak them in. Yeah. Oh by the way, I'm sneaking some people in. Yeah. Oh there's going to be some nuclear bombs we're going to drop.  Yeah but yeah. Let's do that. Let's get together a few guys like maybe Normand.  Yeah. Maybe shiftier. Yeah. Why not. Crazy people. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Do it all in here.  And do I know I may not Skype options might be available to have someone.  We might not be in this room anymore but then I got ideas motherfucker. Moving on. I'm doing shit. I'll take this studio when you're done.  I'll take this. You want to you're going to move here, right?  I might, yeah. I mean it's getting a little crazy over there.  Listen, if you move here, I might have this available for you. Getting a little crazy over there. Yeah. Good Internet. You know, if you're in the black, this is your spot.  Yeah. This is just this is the spot. I like it. This is like a Boston Chinese restaurant. I had to put this thing together.  I mean, I didn't put it together, but Matt Alvarez did. Yeah, we can make it more red. Yeah. We had to put this thing together. Yeah. I literally decided I like that. Leave it like that. Leave it like that is right. That's tight. That's this is nice. Yeah.  That's tight from from the inside. We were going to leave L.A. to living here. Right.  Six weeks quick, six week quick. We were from deciding we're going to leave L.A. to shipping everybody moving the whole crew. Yeah. Like everybody, security people. Everybody.  Jamie, my, my family fucking we had to move all the equipment.  We had to set everything up. We had, you know, they had to put together this fucking room.  And people like you, I hate to tell you, it's a spot where I talk.  Yeah. Yeah. What do you give a fuck what's behind me. Yeah. Yeah.  But I got plans. Yeah, I got plans for stage two.  I like to address it the other day said folks relax. Yeah. Just settle down. Settle down. It's not ok. Yeah. It'll all be ok.  It's like there's a thing these are sound panels. Yeah. I just thought they were cool. Well I appreciate that and thanks for letting me use your backyard for my pop up shop whenever you want. Tell everybody what started clubs up and he's like, I don't think so. I'm like, I'll just bring everyone, have a card, get a hundred people, have a spot for you. Yeah. Let's clear it off real quick.  Yeah, I think there's going to be I mean, there's a Velveeta room here stands by. He's still doing stand up. I don't know what's going on. I think a lot of stuff to Austin is closed and the whole Sixth Street was sketch the other day.  I drove down Six Street during the day and I was like, whoa, this looks sketchy. Nothing looks good right now.  Everything's closed up weird. And it opens up, does it? I hear music at night downtown.  Well, I heard music for sure, but I also saw a lot of like very homeless looking folk. Wandering around, yeah, well, that's going to get worse and worse unless people figure out a way to get people back to work and get people mental health care and get people all kinds of shit. Bridget Fennessy sent me a video that she took from Venice.  Yeah, it's.  It's money and what's going on a mile straight, I mean a mile straight of hands, like the fucking video just keeps going and going and going and you're like, no, no, that can't be hold on.  It's like, why are there no tents in Beverly Hills, though, you know, because there's people with a lot of money, right?  That's exactly what it is. Yeah. But then they tweet on Twitter about, you know. Right. I mean, it's like, well, that's expensive. But there they have this, like, stupid idea of like what's OK, the price.  People think it's fine. It's fine. Look at this. Watch this. Can you to see that? Yeah, this is crazy, this is crazy. Look how long this goes. I'll send it to you, Jimmy.  I'll airdrop it to you, because people need to see this because a lot of people think like, oh, you're exaggerating.  It's not good. It's bad. It's not a big deal here.  Young Jimmy, it's on the way to you. It's not good. It's a fairly long video. The center, Eddie. The this is the thing that is missing airdrop. Yeah, they can eat shit as long as there's an airdrop and as long as Appel's better with privacy, they can eat shit.  You can't put it up there. Check this out. Watch this. Let's let's watch how long this is. This is like a minute long video. And watch. Here we go. Ten, ten, ten, ten, ten, I'm not exaggerating. Turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn, turn.  Tent, tent, tent, tent, tent. It goes on and on and on and on and on and on, and you fast forward, it keeps going. It keeps going. Like this is a long fucking video. It's more than a minute long and it's just all tense. It's crazy. And that's just some of it, that's just some of it. Yeah, there's there's real bad problems and there's no good ways to solve them, right.  To fix them. Nobody knows how to fit.  Well, they're doing this dumb shit like putting boulders under the things that you can't do, that you just going to make them move and then they're going to be right somewhere else with the tent.  I guess you fix it. Mental health care. The problem is they keep trying to build this low cost housing, but it's I think it's like seven hundred forty thousand dollars per unit of low cost housing.  Why is it costing that much as so much regulation and red tape? And they won't let them do drugs there, so they leave. Right. And if you don't if you don't make it illegal for them to just have tents on fucking sidewalks so you can't walk around you.  Right. You got to walk on the highway because of fucking tents everywhere. What about mental health care? That but that's still a long play. That's not going to fix anything overnight.  Would you say shoot them? Kill them.  So what you just said, well, I'm a mental health care clinic that they would walk into thinking it's a clinic and then you would vaporize.  I don't know what's going to fix it, but I don't know either. I think it's one of those things where it got too far. It went too far. It went it's too far gone. Yeah. But they didn't like they didn't have a few tents and they said, hey, folks, what's wrong? Can we help? Let's let's let's put together a program to help these people. Yeah. And then covid came along and everything like magnified by ten.  Yeah. The system seems to be buckling in certain places and that's one of the places it seems to be buckling.  The most noticeably is in Los Angeles and the money are just like fungible money are out of it.  They're just completely, you know, I suppose in the Hamptons, I suppose some guy, the Hamptons, he had no idea what was going on. It said to me is like, aren't problems on Twitter these real problems?  I'm like, no, they're real problem, but they're out they're out to lunch.  You know, people people that are just insulated by their own, you know, social circle or wherever they are.  But I mean, you know, these these problems, whether it's the fires, the the economy, the homeless people, they're all it's a perfect storm.  And Los Angeles is just in deep, deep trouble. And they're not opening up anytime soon. It seems so poorly managed, very poorly.  I mean, I didn't realize how important it is to have a good mayor until I saw this shit.  Right and a good governor. Well, if you want to feel better about Los Angeles, go right over to New York City.  And Bill de Blasio has destroyed fifteen years of progress in five months.  It really has. Yeah, absolutely. That city right now at night does not feel fun to walk around. Yeah. Tell me what it was like. Well, it was weird.  We had an Airbnb, I mean, to do to opens for me. We were we had an Airbnb. We leave a beautiful apartment on like but but it was in Hell's Kitchen right by Times Square.  But we're in one of those high rises. I said, you know, we're we're all the way up, you know, and then the Uber we got in.  No, there was a hazmat. It was it was wrapped in, you know, literally like I was in a hazmat suit in the Uber. The Uber was like cellophane wrapped like, you know, to partition. It was from Twelve Monkeys.  Remember, that movie was that's exactly what was from. And then he dropped us off two blocks from the Uber. And, you know, he had a camera. We're filming stuff.  And the walk from the Uber to the apartment was I never felt that way in New York.  I mean, it was pretty wild, like you were looking at stuff and you were going like this is teetering on on a real big problem. Like there's just people out in the streets now.  You know, if you were a tourist, you would not be. Yeah, that's our Uber driver.  If you were a tourist or if you were somebody visiting the city, it would not be a place you would feel comfortable or they defund the police about 100 million.  Yeah, they're taking money away and they're going to have less cops. And then instead of trying to figure out and solve some of these problems, they're just trying to like again, they want to win on Twitter.  They want to win the war on Twitter. Right. It's like that's what Hillary Clinton she tried to win the election on Twitter. That was a big thing.  Like thing is, even the progressives are attacking de Blasio and, well, they hate him, too.  I mean, he's he's he's across the board, incompetent, incompetent, eats pizza with a fork.  Yes. And nobody trusts him.  And he's just he's an empty headed goon.  Yeah. That's that's a good way to describe it. Yeah. Yeah. There's no de Blasio fans now. It's it's a dark time for New York City. And I don't know how it bounces back. I don't know who's right, James Altucher or Jerry Seinfeld. But that was amusing. They're both wrong because they're neither one of them are living in New York City.  So Jerry Seinfeld has a trillion dollar home in the Hamptons. And James, our teachers in Florida selling God only knows survivalist kits out of his basement.  And I like him, but, you know, I don't I think it just ebbs and flows. I think it's a cycle I think you're in for some years of darkness.  Ari likes it. The moving. Yeah, right. Right. Yeah. The who. The ultra. Sorry. That needs to be gritty. Yeah. Who. The artist. The tick tock. I mean, talkers are moving. They're going to take over. Yeah. That's what we need. We need punk rockers. Yeah.  I think that's possible. That happens in a few years. Things get bad. Go the around.  Right, lower the rates, the artists come in, you know people and then maybe you know, listen then you see like architects start taking big chances again because the rents are cheap, they start building cool buildings, reinventing public spaces. There's some type of renaissance. I mean, look, after World War Two, we had a real big boom in the fifties.  Going to need a Giuliani. Well, then you're going to need somebody. So they're going to need somebody. So Xela Ella is going to need some guy who comes in and puts his fucking foot down and it'll have to get really bad before that.  You know, when Giuliani got elected, I think it was in the in 1990, there was like twenty nine or three thousand homicides in Manhattan.  Twenty nine or three. No, it was it was twenty nine hundred or 3000, but it was no, it's literally it was it was it was almost 3000 homicides. And then we got it down to like four or five hundred a year. That's a massive difference in the amount of people getting killed. You get maimed and shot and all these other crimes.  Well, the feeling of Times Square, I remember it from back in those days. It was weird. Yeah. He'd be doing this was sketchy, like, let's get out of here now. It's like it was like a mall.  And Giuliani, because he did a great job, but he'd because he's kind of a little bit of a kryten and a lot of people forgot how bad it was. They don't they don't give him any of the credit for that. They say all of the credits to go to somebody else. But the reality was it was a lot of the new initiatives that he kind of brought forward.  Well, here's the thing. As much as you like to think progressively and be a person who's open minded and that's who I am.  Yeah, you need law and order. You know, you need to fucking need it.  You need a signing's. We need a society. You need punishment for people who break those rules. We need to have a society.  Otherwise we have nothing else.  That's why the amount of people that glorify or excuse random acts of violence against people and private property in the pursuit of a political game to me is to say that is the single craziest development in my life.  I'm 35 that I've seen that the media and even political figures excuse random violence acts against innocent people and their property in service of an overall political point.  That is crazy. CNN Chris Cuomo.  Yeah, since when does a protest have to be peaceful? That's crazy.  That is a crazy thing.  I said you think that's what someone outstrips that forum? Someone I don't know. I don't know.  But I don't think it's scripted. I think he has a mind virus. I think he's sick. I think they're all sick and something's eating their brains.  Drop one of those. And I think they all think that when the revolution or whatever happens, they want to be this.  I want to be the good white guy who said go out there and burn it all down. I'm your friend, right? Remember me? Even though I'm a rich white guy and you don't like them, I told you to burn it down. We're good, right? We're not. They're going to get you to. You're their enemy, too, dummy.  You know they are. You remember that video where there's kids in the in the house and they're watching these people march by and they give them the thumbs up. People start throwing rocks at the window. But we agree with you. Hey, I'm on your side.  That's exactly when you unleash chaos. You're inviting chaos. Yes. There's no way to contain it.  And I think the corners of the world and all of those people are trying to marshal the forces that they're opening up. A comedian friend of mine, Yoni's papà, said it because they're opening up the gates of hell, they're opening up the gates of hell, and then they're trying to, like, instruct everybody where to go and how bad the fires are going to get. Like, dude, when you open up those gates, you have no idea what's going to happen.  November 3rd. We'll talk. Let's go. Let's make it happen. Let's go. Tim Dehlin, ladies and gentlemen.
