 Hello, friends, welcome to the show, this episode, the podcast is brought to you by Trager Trager Grilles. I'm a huge fan of these. I cook on them all the time. In fact, I cooked on one last night, which is not odd for me. I probably cook on it four or five days a week, at least whenever I'm home. It's the best way to cook. First of all, it's wood and fire. That's all it is.  It seems like it would be complicated to use because it looks pretty cool and it's electronic and everything, but it's very simple.  Trager Grill uses wood pellets that are made like if you buy hardwoods, if you bought some Oakwood, they have the saw and cut that wood, right? Well, they take the sawdust and they compress that sawdust using the natural sugars in the wood. They make these pellets, these pellets, you put them into the hopper, they're fed through this worm drive into a heating element. It heats up the pellets and boom, fire and wood, that's all it is, imparts a delicious, smoky flavor to your food.  I can't say enough good things about it. I was a fan of these things long before they're ever a sponsor of the podcast. I've had one for years. I love it. I cooked some delicious rib eyes last night that I got from Adam. Perry Lang cooked him at two hundred and seventy five degrees and then I finished it at 500. It came out perfect. Amazing. They have an awesome application that comes with it to the wildfire app.  It has. First of all, it has over 1500 plus recipes on the app. You can also control the temperature of the grill from anywhere with the app. You can even shut it down. And the the beautiful thing about the app with the recipes like, say, save the app, if the recipes on the app call for you, cook it at one temperature for a certain amount of time and then you change it after twenty minutes. Well, the app will do all that for you.  It will navigate the entire cycle for you and you can cook anything on a trigger grill.  You can barbecue. You can bake, you can roast, you can, you can grill. You can do everything. I love them and they're having a beautiful sale. Trager Day, May 16th is Trager Day. It's an annual day or holiday dedicated to Trager that encourages our entire nation to grill and celebrate all things trigger. And the trigger day sale is from May 15th through 17th.

My guest today is my good friend Michael Yo, Michael Yo.  We've been friends for a long time. He was actually on Season one episode one of Fear Factor.  He was in the pilot episode. That's when I met him. He's a great guy. I love him.  And he was on the last time he was here in February, he went to New York and he got the coronavirus and had a really, really bad time of it.  It was very touch and go. And he was real sick. It was scary times and he wanted to come in and talk about it. Now that he's fully recovered and healthy.  And it's even when I say fully recovered, he's not really fully recovered.  He's still very weak because of it. And we got into all that and a lot more. I love this guy.  He's just just a sweetheart of a person and he's hilarious.  Please give it up for the great and powerful Michael Yo Girlfriend podcast, the Joe Rogan Experience Train, My Day Job podcast, my life all day.  Michael Yo. Yes, back from the brink. Oh, it's crazy.  You are the first guy that well, my friend Sturgell got it and I talked to him, but he didn't get it real bad. Like how bad is not real bad. OK, he was like a little fatigued.  Yeah. Yeah. So it's to give me the full rundown but people don't know what we're talking about. You got coronavirus you one of the first you get it that I know you got it right after you were on this podcast who runs podcast. You flew to New York there.  Gotham for four shows. Little Rundown. Yeah, little rundown. As soon as I landed I did Wendy Williams on Monday and then I flew back and went to Vegas for a day. So as I got back and then I had three auditions, so I was run down.  And that weekend we felt sick already.  No, just so hard. Just tired, tired. But I mean, we're always tired, right? You know, road the road gets you. Yeah. And I was I was moving all the time and very stressful. You know, you're trying to perform you're trying to learn lines for an audition. So I was very stressed out. I was traveling a lot and that was like my third weekend in a row.  So it wasn't sleep much sleep. Yeah, I get great sleep. But, you know, with two kids, like, they're both at the age where, you know, you have to have both eyes on them.  Do you ever wear a sleep monitoring device or anything? That I have, but I strap no, I've never worn that.  But I get eight to nine hours of sleep every like I'm a great sleeper, OK? Like I sleep through anything. So it wasn't a sleep thing. I was just I was just tired.  Overworked, maybe.  But Saturday that Saturday, I didn't feel right. My temperature went up to like one, two, one. This is you flew to New York. What day it was I performed. I was there Wednesday, which would have been, I'm guessing, our dates. May 4th. I mean. Yeah, March 4th, March 4th. I performed the 6th and 7th. Stayed the 8th. Did Wendy Williams on the 9th flew back that Monday.  Went to Vegas Tuesday morning, came back that same day, then when you do in Vegas, besides heroin now we were, you know, visiting her parents, my wife's parents with the kids and then but no party and no party, it was drive in and drive out. But that's exhausting. That's 10 hours on the road. Yeah. And then dealing with two kids in a car and then the three auditions and then that Saturday I didn't feel right.  And this is you got to remember when I performed in New York, there's only 11 deaths and it was like 3000 cases. That's how much this thing has changed. But Saturday, I didn't feel right. 101 it went. I said I should isolate myself because I in New York, that's all you heard about. So I was like, let me just be safe and isolate.  So let's let's break this down. So you leave Wednesday, you go to New York, do a couple of different TV things, then you do the weekend at Gotham and then you fly home and then you go to Vegas on Tuesday and then you drive home on Wednesday, come back Tuesday night to Jesus. Yeah. So in and out. In one day. In and out one day.  And then Wednesday, Thursday, Friday audition. Then Saturday it was like, OK, this is my rest day.  And then I woke up and something just didn't feel right. So I was going, OK, it's probably the road. You know what, I'm stressed road.  So it's about during the day I hang out, isolate myself, but I'm between one hundred and one to one second day. I'm like one one 102. But I'm still like, look, I'm a I'm a beat. This thing they say stay at home, because at that time they said if you have symptoms, stay at home because they're taking the more serious cases.  Right. So the Sunday Sun came around.  I kind of went down a little. I was taking aspirin, a lot of aspirin, because one doctor at the time said, take it every four hours.  And I was also taking aspirin and something else to bring your temperature down. I forgot what it was, but, oh, aspirin.  And what you said when you started taking ibuprofen, that's when it fucked you up. That's when I felt it did. So Sunday I started getting this massive headache. So that's when I really started poppin the aspirin three every three hours.  But aspirin or ibuprofen, it was ibuprofen.  There's a big difference between aspirin, ibuprofen, ibuprofen is a nonsteroidal and. OK, well, I was taking I was taking Advil, whatever that is, and nonsteroidal antiinflammatory. OK, this is what I keep hearing. I don't know if this has been substantiated that you shouldn't take ibuprofen while you have this.  OK, well, whatever reason, I don't know what that is.  I don't know. I don't know if that's been discredited or is that is don't really I don't know either.  So I was taking a lot of Advil, OK, lot of Advil and Tylenol to bring the fever down. So I got it down on Sunday, but then I had a massive headache. So then they said, well, you temperature's going down. This was our doctor friend, your temperature is going down. Just hit the Advil. So I hit the Advil Monday at noon. I couldn't breathe like gasping for air and my wife had to call nine one one to the house to come get me.  So I'm gasping for air. 911 one shows up, they bring me outside, they throw me on this huge this oxygen machine right away.  They like we kind of on a ventilator, not a ventilator. No, just just normal oxygen. They say we got to get oxygen in you, OK? And it is almost like a movie.  I'm the neighbors are all our ambulance is overlooking me. You know, the ambulance is there. All the neighbors. Look, I can't breathe. My son is in the window. This is the worst. My son is in the window. He doesn't know what's going on, but he knows it's not good. And he's only three and he's crying.  And I'm watching him cry. And I can't do anything.  I can't breathe. And literally, when they pick me up to carry me to the ambulance because I need to get me to the hospital right away, it was the whole window thing. He put his hand up. Oh. Oh, jeez.  It it really hurt me really bad. So I get into the ambulance and they take me. As soon as I get to the hospital, the doctor goes, you got a corona. So they take.  But did they do a test or did. Yes. The first thing they do is they do a chest X-ray and they go, you got double pneumonia in Corona.  What's double pneumonia when it's in both lungs? OK, so double pneumonia. And you have Corona, we believe. But we got a test, so they, you know, swab me and stuff. But they took all the precautions like a had corona. I was a first Corona patient at this hospital. This out early it was, you know, so they took me to ICU and the doctor came in and I go, hey, this is escalating and I'm still can't breathe.  I go, am I going to make it? And he goes, We'll know in two days. It's going to go really good or really bad and we'll know in two days and every nurse or doctor that came in.  When they can't tell you if you're going to make it or not, you know, they try to comfort you, but they can't really say you're going to make it an.  It and I was in the worst pain I've ever felt in my life to where had I mean, just think about the worst migraines you've ever had times 100.  My body was hot and cold. It would get so hot, my temperature got up to one hundred and three point eight and they had to bring it down and then it would go up to one hundred three point eight again.  I couldn't move. My body was aching literally the second night I was there. And I know this is the wrong thing to think, but if they had a button on life, I may hit it. I was in that much pain like that. I couldn't even think clearly.  It I can't put into words how bad it was for me, so your head, your body, every everything, or you just want it to be over. Wow, it's either you're going to make it, you're like and it was so bad where you want to think about your family. But I was in so much pain, you know, I thought about them, but it was I can't make it. This is this is the end. And I can't see my family because they already told me that no one can come into the hospital.  And I'm texting my wife, lying to her saying, hey, babe, I'm going make it through and make it through where I'm talking to my parents.  Got this may not go well.  You know, and my parents, the first thing I texted my parents is I'm scared, I'm never texted him something like that, and they knew how serious it was. And I said, look, Claire is my wife.  Claire is at home with the two kids. I can't let her worry about this. You know, she was already stressed out enough. She saw enough, you know, so I'm in there and the doctor says that no one can come see you. So I'm going. If these are the last two days of my life, I'm going to die alone in this hospital. And it just broke me up so bad that. You know, I've taken care of myself, I've done everything I can, you know, to take care of myself and why am I lying in this bed right now, you know, and it was a thing where.  When I did think about my wife, it was I will never see my wife and two kids again. You know, that that's all that went through my mind is like I did they put you on a ventilator? No, my doctor saved my life. My doctor said if we put you on a ventilator, he said that he says because the nurse brought up, should we put him on a ventilator? And he goes, no way. If we put him on a ventilator, he's going to die because his body is going to say, OK, this machine is breathing for us.  We don't need to work anymore. And your body shuts down.  If you heard in New York, 80 percent of the people put on ventilators die. And that's why you think I think that's why I survived. I've heard that I've heard that being speculated by other doctors as well. And it's very controversial because so many doctors put people on ventilators and the last thing they want to hear is another doctor saying, you've put someone on a ventilator, they'll die.  But you know that my doctor said that straight up in the room in front of me to the nurses, like if we put him on it, he's going to die because his thing was it just makes sense why he would, because now this machine is going to breathe for him. So his body's not going to it's like working out. You don't work on a muscle. It gets weak. Right. This machine is doing all your lifting. So why would we want to put them on that?  Unless it's it's just we have to put them on it, you know? But you've heard doctors. We're putting on people so fast because their oxygen levels were so low right there.  Like, this is a this is not normal.  So we need to do something to get their oxygen level up.  I think doctors are like everything else, right. There's really good ones. And there's ones that aren't as good knows. It's true with everything else, with everything, carpenters, plumbers, everything, everything.  And it's really I look back, I'm still now I've become very close to him.  And the dude saved my life because if I went on a ventilator, bro, I don't I may not be here because I'm still on a ventilator.  They kind of knock you out. Yeah. You're unconscious. Literally.  That machine is doing all your breathing. So what did they give you? What kind of medication did they give you while you were out? While I'm healthy. Don't drink, don't do drugs, I was the perfect test subject. Maybe that's a problem, but it's not used to fight. And I don't know if you are going to party all the time, but it's like we know how to recover. This motherfucker went on a bender. Listen to this.  I gave it to my mom.  Oh, OK. So she gets home. She didn't tell me why I was in the hospital. She beat it in one day and she talked shit to me now. Oh, see, I beat it in one day.  I have one fever. You take eight days in ICU, you know, and then she tells me it's cause you to have to you need carbs.  No need carbs. That's now she's a doctor. Now she's a doctor. But I gave it to my mom. She beat it one day, but well, she probably wasn't run down.  No, dude, run down is the thing, man. You know, look, I'm a guy I take a lot of vitamins. I work out a lot. I get in the sun every day. But I just flew back from Florida. I saw you to Florida and came back yesterday. I felt like dog shit. And just from the flight man, just from his one day. So I scheduled an I.V. vitamin drip. I had a vitamin drip come to my house, hit me with glue to on zinc, vitamin C, everything.  And I felt better almost immediately.  Yeah. You got to take care of yourself and about to. Yeah. How I don't want to get off me. But like how was that spacing at this venue for you during the fight. Because, because it sounded like you were next to each other. And then I heard like in a story y'all are separated.  We were about as far as Jamie is about as far as John it was. And then DC was like a little further than that because there was a separation. There's like the octagon post. And so for him to get a better angle, he couldn't be sitting right in front of the post. So they moved his table like another. He was probably 15, 20 feet from me somewhere around that, where people did feel that.  I feel like fighter, you know, fighters are tough, you know, and I feel like the audience is tough, too, in the people associated with it. It's tough.  Did they move around freely or was it really like, oh, I need to stay away from them?  Here's the deal. Everyone was tested. Everyone, in fact, one guy tested positive.  He was asymptomatic, Shagari Sosa, who was on the card, and he had an inkling that he might test positive because he had a family member that had it and he was super healthy, ready to fight, but he had it in his system. And so they removed him from the card and he had been wearing a mask and gloves the entire time he was there. And everyone else had wristbands on the wristbands showed that you'd been tested. They had temperature monitors, had all these different things, but everybody had been tested, thoroughly tested for antibodies, tested for this swab.  I got the swab up the nose. I got everything done. So and then when I got home, I immediately got swabbed again. I got a swab yesterday and then I got the vitamin drip and everything like that. But I didn't get much sleep Saturday night because I was flying back eight o'clock in the morning. Flights were done. I was back to my hotel room 230. So I crashed, woke up early, got to the airport, took off, landed, and then just kind of took it easy yesterday.  But until I got the vitamin drip I was dragging, I was feeling. And that's what happens when you fly. And you had flown a couple of times in a short period of time and then that drive to Vegas, all that stuff. You have to think of your immune system like troops. You know, you really do.  If there's a battle to be fought, you're look, if your body was like your mom's where, you know, you had a good night's sleep every night. No, Trav'lin, you can fight off a lot more shit. But when you do those trips, especially, this is one thing that I'm getting out of this quarantine is, man, I feel so much better when I don't travel.  Oh, yeah. So much better when I wasn't dying.  I feel great now. I feel great now. I feel great now. Yeah. Rest is a big thing. It's everything. It's everything. Everything.  And you know, I'm going to change my travel schedule in the future because even this trip, this trip, I wanted to just get in and get the fuck out of Florida and get back home and and, you know, but then after I did it, I was like, it would've been wiser if I left at like six p.m. or something like that, like just kind of chill out, give myself plenty time to sleep, sleep.  So I'm fully recovered and then, you know, have some breakfast, then go to the airport, you know, take a 3:00 p.m. flight or some shit.  How was it with nobody in there? Did you enjoy the experience? I wanted to do it because I've never done that before. And I watched the one card from Brazil. They had Kevin Lee versus Charles Oliveras fought in Brazil. And I watched on TV and was like, God, that's so strange because like Gilbert Burns, he knocked out Damian Maya and then he yells out pulla.  You know, there's something Brazilian said and he yells, apologize. And you hear it like Pafko in this empty arena.  And while I was watching him, like, that's so strange. He's screaming and there's no one there. There's no no audience reaction.  I'm like, wow. So I decided, like, I got to do one. So when Dana White asked me if I wanted to do it, I was like, yeah, I want to do one.  I definitely want to. Do you feel like the fighters were listening to the one hundred percent where they made adjustments?  Because the things that DC said. So Kamia, you know, we're all right.  That that close. Oh, yeah. We're we're at the octagon. OK, we're still at the octagon. We're right in front of the octagon. OK, I can reach up and touch the octagon.  So when I was actually a little bit further than we usually are, but still around like like where that wall is, that's where the gun is pretty close and, you know, giving them points.  He's like appointers.  He's saying, you know, he's got to check those leg kicks and you guys make an adjustment. It's like he was talking about Karl Esparza and Karl Esparza backstage gave D.C. credit for like what what the advice that he was saying in the commentary, the adjustments that she made. That's great. Yeah, it was weird.  You know, I loved watching, like, I watched the prelims, but I loved it because you could hear everything because normally so loud.  Yeah, but when somebody hit somebody, it's in the face. You could hear it, but especially the body.  Yeah. Oh my. It was like a thump. Yeah. And then you hear the other person. Oh yeah.  I'm it changed the game for me among UFC where you I think a lot of people appreciate it more with not having a crowd yell where you really get the feel the pain because when it's loud you don't see somebody fall but you don't really.  OK, but when you hear it. Yeah. Oh there's different things going on.  Right. It's like there's the energy, the crowd that that's a factor. That's a real thing. Like there's something magical about a wild finish in front of a packed house at the T-Mobile arena.  Everybody's screaming and cheering like, wow.  Or like when. McGregor walked to the octagon and everybody's going crazy.  There's something to that, it's valuable, but there's also something to just the spectacle of Tony Ferguson and Justin Gates just going at it.  I mean, like wild five rounds, slug fest with no audience, just.  Do you think that fight would have been different if a crowd was there?  No, no, no, I don't think so. Maybe, but I don't think so. It's possible.  I think Justin had a game plan and he executed it brilliantly. And I think Ferguson Nene, he's always going to be Tony Ferguson. He's one of the toughest men to ever walk the face of the earth. But I think he was preparing for a grappler. You know, he's preparing for Kabab no Madoff. And that fight didn't take place. It was supposed to take place in April. So he had been training for Shebib, by the way, is the fifth time that flight was canceled, the fifth time the fight with Tony could be cancelled.  So Tony has been training for Shabib for fucking years. Right. So he's ready for this elite grappler, takes everybody down, smashes them. He's trying to he's going to cut them from the bottom. He's thinking of submitting them and scrambling and getting legless and all these different things that he's thinking of. And then he's fighting an all-American wrestler who does not want to go to the ground and was nasty striking. So it's a totally different game plan. And he has to make an adjustment over a period of just a few weeks.  And so Justin's fight is I mean, just it always fights the same way. So Justin's adjustments weren't nearly as big as Tony's. Tony had to make some some big adjustments, but Justin just fought a masterpiece. The way he fought was just magnificent. And he listened to his coaches so well. There's a point during the fight with Trevor Wittman is telling him you're hitting him too hard, you're swinging for the bleachers. He was just take about 10 percent off your punches, hit him with good, clean shots, and he immediately made that adjustment.  And then his cardio leveled out because he was getting tired towards the end of the second and because he was just throwing bombs every every shot to try and take Tony Ferguson's head off. But you can't knock Tony out with one shot. He's inhumanly tough, inhumanly tough. So Justin backs it off a little bit and just is thrown clean shots and then winds up just dominating them and then they stop it in the fifth round.  What's the one thing you learned? Like, was there something you took away from this experience that, like you didn't take away from any other?  It was interesting. It was interesting. I felt very, very fortunate to be there. And I got to all the people that could be here to watch one of the greatest fights of all time. I felt super fortunate that I was one of those people that got to be there. I felt like real fortunate for that, like everything about it. I was I was like taken in the moment and just like really cherishing it. I'm like, wow, this is amazing.  Like, not a lot. A lot of people get to do this. Not a lot of people get to experience this. Not a lot of people get to do commentary for the UFC period, but to do commentary for championship fights in this arena where there's no one there.  So we're in a 15000 seat arena and there's maybe ten people in the audience.  So why didn't the arena that big? We were talking about that. Why can't we do this? We could have done this in the hotel. Yeah, we got a conference room and set up the octagon in there. Like, literally. Yeah.  I was wondering why they did that. But is it a spectacle of having a big arena just to say you did it?  I think there's something to that, to letting everybody know, hey, these are strange, strange times. You know, we're in the middle of this health crisis. And so this is the response to this health crisis. We're going to do this shit in this arena.  But would you do it again? Because you said you wanted to do one, but it seemed like you didn't you didn't mind it.  I enjoyed well. I mean, I love Confiance, and I think as long as I take the right precautions, I'm tested a lot and I'm keeping my immune system in check and making sure that I don't do anything that wears me out. And I did kind of fuck that up by flying home with just a few hours sleep on Saturday. But I took care of myself on Sunday and just hung around with the family and we, you know, didn't do much, just went on a hike and hung out and enjoyed the the summer and enjoyed the weather.  Whether it's beautiful weather out here right now, it's not quite some spring, but I think as long as you do that, I think you can be OK. I think when you put yourself in a position like yourself, when you worn yourself out or if you have a compromised immune system, this is my thought. And this is from talking to numerous doctors, including my own personal doctor, who's very critical. My my personal doctor is very critical about the way we're handling this this crisis.  What's he say?  Moisés? The the most important thing is education on how to keep your immune system healthy. It's like this is something that you're not hearing. Everything is social distancing. Everything is cover your mouth. Everything is use hand sanitizer, because that's wonderful, because that's all good stuff. But we need education on how to keep your immune system strong.  We need education on to have Dr. Rhonda Patcher coming in later this week to try to school people on what the actual clinical tests, the actual real knowledge, what we really understand about the immune system and supplementation and headshot proteins called shock proteins, all the different various methods that we know are actually legitimately, provably effective.  I think it's interesting how all these different facts are coming out, because when I was at the beginning of it, but I've heard from so many after I went through this and big shout out to your fan base because they reached out to me, you showed me so much love when I was in the hospital and I just got out. And that means so much to me when they reached out. And it was really all love.  But so many doctors reached out to me, too, and said, there's so much misinformation out there. And I texted you about one that people should know about when people get out of the hospital.  What KORONA Like, there's no magical time.  They're saying 14 days, literally. When I got out the hospital, I was in the hospital for eight days. The last three days, I didn't have a fever. So they let me go. They said seven days, six days after that, I would be fine.  But another doctor told me, look, after you're cleared after fourteen days, people still have Korona there. They're taking the chance that it's not contagious. And that's why hospitals don't test people. And he said that this is why hospitals don't test people before they let them go. It's because they know they still got Korona, but hopefully it's not contagious. So that's why they never test, because if they did, that means people got to stay there two to three weeks longer.  Oh, and that's the real reason he says we would never. Can you imagine when New York was going through that? Like, really I mean, they're still going through it. But when it was at its peak. Yeah. If they tested everybody that left, most of those people would still have Corona's. So that would back up the system even more.  And then insurance has to pay for an extra three weeks. So I learned that. I learned that my other doctor said this whole pre-existing conditions is bullshit. He goes, you came in. He says, this is how much bullshit it is you came in. If I would have died in the hospital, they would have said my pre existing condition was migraines.  They would have gone down, as he said, they are some pre-existing conditions that weaken your immune system like obesity, diabetes. There's a bunch of them that they're saying in New York are the primary factors that wind up having a really hard time with this.  Well, he's saying, though, they're using that pre-existing conditions. And I say it in quotes to. Let healthy or other people almost like, oh, well, if you don't have this pre-existing condition, you're going to be fine, but it's not true. It's like they're using it to calm people down, egos. It's not true at all.  He says, I see people that are fine, just like you, Mike. I see people that do have preexisting conditions. I see the whole gamut.  It's not just people with pre-existing conditions, but they're finding those people and highlighting those illnesses, even that they're even adding deaths to that preexisting conditions total because they they need some in deaths to the for excess like mine if my pre-existing condition.  He said if I were to die in that hospital, he says, oh, well, he had migraines in his past, so they would have put that down as a pre-existing condition. Well, how often you get migraines?  I mean, ever since I was a kid, but really well, I played college football for University, Arkansas. I got so many concussions I couldn't play anymore. So and this was before the whole concussion.  So my mom made me quit. She was like, you're not playing anymore. So it was a thing where but it wasn't a condition.  I have once every I have one every five, six months maybe.  But he says, would you come in with since I had migraines and they didn't know my history of migraines. But he goes, we would have had to say that was a preexisting condition.  I haven't heard that preexisting condition being migraines, but I have heard diabetes is a giant factor. Obesity is a giant factor. Emphysema, smoke, cigarettes. But then there was an article recently, something I got super suspicious and I didn't even read the articles in the article. It said that nicotine may help people with coronavirus.  And I was like, that's the fucking cigarette industry. Right? Did you see the documentary Merchants of Doubt?  No, it's a great documentary. What's it about? It's about people that are hired to go on shows and put doubt into people's minds about certain things that would benefit an industry.  So these guys, they originally started out the same. And the documentary shows the same people would go on these talk shows, talk about cigarettes. Marlboro cigarettes are not addictive. This is this is not the marble man. These are people that are there posing like experts. And they're on these, you know, those stupid fucking talk shows on CNN and stuff. We have three windows. And then there's like Anderson Cooper. There's a person who is left and a person who is right.  And the guy on the right is like, cigarettes are not addictive. It's been proven.  You know, you move up and he's just rattling it off. And then you see that same guy later in the documentary, many years later talking about climate change. It's the same thing.  Talking about climate change is a myth. It's just a natural cycle of the earth. Human beings have nothing to do with it.  And it's literally the same human being doing the same thing.  But we see that in politics. It's all spin. Right. But this is this is what I'm saying when I read something about nicotine being good for people that have the coronavirus might come on cigarette industry.  Yeah. And you motherfuckers involved in this because like who's running tests on let's let's try morphine. You know, let's let's let's see how heroin works on these people. What about coke? You don't give him cocaine.  You know, he's crazy about morphine is my migraine was so bad in a hospital, they came in and go, we're going to give you morphine. Oh, knock it right out while you had Corona. Yes. Oh, jeez.  Like I said, they gave me everything, dude, like I was morphine y you had Corona, so they gave it to me to get because my head was so bad. I really felt like accentuated your migraines.  So the coronavirus accentuated those. My I it was so bad I can't even put it into words.  So when you're talking about the pain that you had, you had body pain and then your migraines on top of that. Yes. So you just in and hot cold everything.  So they gave me morphine. They go this knocks out any headache. It worked for five seconds, five seconds. And they looked at me and they go, how you feel now? Like terrible. It feels the same. Then about two hours later, they came back and gave me more because I think they only can do it every two hours.  So yells No, no, no. But I got I got really hot, really hot. I was like, I can't do this anymore. So they had to stop giving it to me. And this is how this is how I was a test subject. I don't mind because I'm living. But hydroxy chloroquine, that was big at the time.  Yeah, I'm watching this on the news. Literally, the president says Draxler can all the doctors.  Yes. No. Yes. No. Yes. No. They come in with it. Well, they are in bed. I'm in bed.  This is my first day. They come in with it. I'm watching news and they're talking about it. They come in. It's like, what are you giving me. Oh, DROs Corvalan. So they give it to me then two hours they come in. What are you giving it. Oh the HIV drug. So now they put two drugs in and then they're pumping all kinds of shit.  I mean I don't even know what they're getting. So they're trying things. They're trying things on me because they don't know. They don't know.  That's what's so crazy. Right. This is not like pneumonia where people have had it for 100 years or a thousand years. They don't know this is a new thing.  So a day and a half goes by. I'm in probably worse pain.  They take me off of hydroxyl chloroquine and I go, this is after like weeks after I got to hospital, go, what are you taking me off? He goes where your body was at that time. It couldn't handle it. It was not a good fit. So we had to take you off. So I must have got worse overnight. And I'm just guessing here. But they must have saw something get worse. My lungs were still filling up with fluid, so they kept me on the HIV drug and whatever else they were given to me.  But it was it's like I still have fluid in my lungs. They said it would take twelve till I.  Yeah, yeah. They only weeks I've been out now eight. Wow. And I'm so weak, literally, I just they just so I am like they just approved me to start working out last week. So I did my first Lift Society class online and I could like usually I could do like 10 to 15 pull ups each that I could do to two pops. And I'm just weak like I still.  Get winded, like when I talk a lot, I'll get winded and I'll just have to catch my breath. Wow.  Like an old man telling you, like for me, people want it real bad. It's just not. Oh, you're over it and you can move on. You got to build back into it. It's like rebuilding your body in your mind.  You know, they recommend anything as far as supplements or anything.  No, nothing, he says, is just rest.  Well, he's basically done his job, right? Yeah. The fuck your life. Figure this shit out on your own. Right. You'll get strong. And literally, I was the first person there. And then by the time I left eight days later, that place was filled with people.  That's how fast it happened. Wow. That's how fast it happened. And I saw people like tap it out, you know, I didn't see it, but I saw, you know, the bodies passed a lot.  And I'm like, wow, how many people died while you were there? I saw one.  And that's when it really hit me that and I got close to a nurse. I go. Did they get to see it because now they died in there alone? They tried to FaceTime? Well. Can you imagine?  Yeah, and then, like you see the stories, walkie talkies, they're talking about walkie talkies, they're talking about phone, they're talking, trying to FaceTime, I, I don't care if I like you or if I like you.  Like there's no way to die by yourself. No. You know, not not today.  And it's the thing where I just want people to know, look. They're opening up the country and I get it, I get the other side, too, that's that's why, you know, I get that people got to work. People got to get their lives back, you know? But you need to be safe. You need to be safe because it's a thing like if President Trump comes out and goes, hey, we're going to do herd immunity, you know, you're prepared for that.  But right now, we don't know what to expect. We've gone from 60000 deaths. Now they're saying it's going to be one hundred seven 37000.  Like what's going on?  You know, we only know what they tell us, you know, but I'm finding out there's so much more stuff we don't know because they don't know right now.  You're finding out that kids like a very small amount of kids are getting it. You know, and I don't understand the whole thing about just not being careful or safe, because it's not about you. It's about other people like these, like the whole thing about, well, you know, a lot of blacks and Hispanics are getting it, you know.  Yeah. Because they're working out all these essential jobs to at the grocery stores.  They're they're they're doing the jobs that a lot of people don't do.  Well, anybody that's in poverty as well would you're working those essential jobs. But on top of that, you're probably not eating well. Exactly. Yeah, it's a that's a real problem. It goes hand in hand. Oh, yeah.  You know, like this whole thing. Like, if you can get a whole meal, two burgers and fries and two Cokes for three ninety nine, it's a problem with that food.  Yeah. You know. Right. Good point. It's it's making you sick. Yeah. You know, but that's all you can afford. Right. You know.  Yeah. It is crazy that the cheapest food is the worst for you and the most fattening, but that's the one that you go to because you can't afford anything else.  Yeah. You know, you know, and then you're getting, you know, and getting stories about, you know, like I have a bunch of Asian friends and they're getting bullied.  I guess it's so terrible.  Like there was a story in Texas. A dude stabbed a guy and his two kids, two and six whites. Yes. It happened a couple of months.  And the two year old, two year old, six year old in the end, the guy because he thought they were Chinese.  Well, it's in Texas at a Sam's Wholesale Club, what yes, it's people are going nuts over this thing, you know, like we're all in this together, but you don't need to take it just because even if he was Chinese, like he's an American, probably, you know, he didn't bring it over here, even if he was Chinese from China.  Yeah. He's not the person who made the fucking disease. That's like me.  Who year old and a two year old, six year old, I, I just feel like this whole time right now is giving people and it's a very small group of people. Yeah.  You know, and that's why I hate when certain people go white people like. No, no, no, no. It's a very small number of white people doing it. I hate when people generalize a group like even the whole Michigan thing. So open carry state, they showed up at this lady's office. You know, the governor's the governor's office, they were carrying the rifles. They were protesting, which they had every right to. And people go out here, people are.  You see it on social media.  Well, these white people. No, no, no, no, no. There's three hundred and fifty six million people in the United States. So that money now, isn't it? I believe so. Jesus Christ, I believe so.  There's only seven hundred people there. Yeah. You know, and probably a third of them just wanted to protest to get their jobs back just to go back to work. Yeah. So you can't generalize people and you can't hate on people because where they're from.  Well you can hate on people that are so fucking dumb they bring guns to the governor's house.  Like what. That is ridiculous.  Like what do you do. I agree. Are you trying to take over the governor? Like what are you doing? Like why are you bringing guns? Are you expecting a war? Are you going hunting? Like, what are you doing? Why are you bringing fucking guns?  That's that's some weird shit. When people do that, when they they protest with like fucking Kalashnikovs and shit like what are you doing, why do you have a rifle?  There was a guy it was a clip. I saw a guy who was like a white guy to a white guy. I was like, hey, I want my job back too.  But why the gun?  And the guy was like, it just walked away.  It doesn't mean if you're protesting. That's the thing about the Second Amendment. And I'm a pro Second Amendment man. I believe in it. I think it's important.  But there's a lot of dumb motherfuckers out there. There's a lot of dumb dumb motherfuckers out there.  And they get to have guns, too. I mean, I support that in a lot of ways. I have to support that if I support the Second Amendment.  But at a certain point time, you got to go, why the fuck are you bringing a gun to Sam's Club? Why? Why do you have a fucking AK around your waist when you're walking through the aisles looking for toilet paper? Like, what are you doing?  It's it's it's amazing how. But but let's be honest, they're giving a pass. You got to you got a USA pass right now to act like that because. Well, no, I mean, you do because. Well, because the president is like those are fine people. You know, everything.  Yeah. What is he saying? He said that the other day. He goes, those are good people that were protesting with the guns, with the guns. Those are good people.  It's just it's a stupid thing to protest with guns like.  One of the nice things about this country is that we can protest. That's a nice thing. It's beautiful. It's important. This is one of the things that's been infringed upon by this whole lockdown thing where people, you know, they're being told they're not allowed to assemble. It's a gigantic part of who we are, the ability to assemble, the ability to protest. But I don't think that's just what they're doing.  When you're showing up with guns, you're letting them know that you're ready to take over, you're ready to do something. You might shoot somebody. You know, you might if you're threatened, you might use these guns.  It's like, OK, if if if we're in that you're escalating way past where we're at. You know, if you if you're in a situation where someone saying, hey, your family has to starve to death, hey, you have to stay home, hey, I don't give a fuck about you. OK, then I understand why you want to show that you have guns and you get to get a bunch of people together. You, hey, we need to stay alive here and we are our rights being infringed upon.  But that's not what's going on. But if you go back to the back story, you find out like I don't know all the facts, but I know these people that showed up to this rally, they didn't put on that rally. It was by another organization through through Facebook or through some social media outlet that put it together.  And they told you people to bring their guns. And no, they just told people to show up, to show up.  So we're there. We're all pawns in this at some point to this political game.  So how can you say this is what's amazing to me, how we're in a place where they can put wearing a mask and make that political? Yeah, like that's where we are today. Eighty thousand deaths and now it's political. If you wear a mask.  I don't know. What do you mean it's political if you wear a mask.  Well, I mean, most of the people that don't wear mask are these. Oh I'm a Trumper like this is what we're seeing on TV. What I'm saying is what we're being shown on TV and that's where most of the people get their information, you know, like from the news or. Oh, so these people are not wearing their mask. Oh, they got to be they got to be Republican, not wearing a mask. Oh, we need more testing.  If you hear we need more testing. Oh, there must be liberal. Yeah. They want to test like we've made a disease that's killing thousands. Thousands. Eighty thousand could be up way over one hundred and twenty thousand political instead of it being hey let's all get through this now it's political.  Well we do that with everything we do. Yeah. And that's a problem. Well we'd like to I mean that's one of the problems with having just two parties in this country and having liberal and conservative, which is crazy because there's a lot of people, myself included, that flowed in between both of those.  I do, too.  I'm very liberal, but I'm also very pro-gun and I like things might be liberal and pro-gun, like can be and I am, but I don't understand why.  Like, if a Democrat says something nice about a Republican, oh, he's not a Democrat or a Republican, said something nice about a Democrat. Oh, I agree with what they said. Oh, no, you can't be a Republican.  Well, if you go on Fox News and you're your liberal people will shame you and get angry at you for using that platform. And I've seen it even with presidential candidates like Tulsi Gabbard and even Bernie Sanders. I think that we're in a weird place in this country where, you know, it's easy to adopt a predetermined pattern of behavior, a conglomeration of ideas, whether those ideas be conservative or liberal.  And the real problem is these people that adopt these ideas, oftentimes, they simply they they sink into these ideas because they're comfortable. It's easy to get if you like, say if you decide people in your neighborhood are conservative, I'm going to be conservative, too, because it's going to make them like me more and I'm going to say the things they want to hear. And, you know, well, I trust in God. I trust in God to.  And they say these things so that people will like you more and then you'll you'll fit in your community better. And it just it's a it's a signal to the people around you that you're complying with the group ideology.  And that is more of that's more of the case than people simply, rationally and objectively going over these ideas. You know, there's there's certain people that decide they don't want gay folks to be married simply because people around them have decided that they don't want gay folks to be married. And marriage is supposed to be between a man and a woman. And you can't tell me any different in the Bible says and this and that and like. And I agree.  And if you agree with that, community will accept you.  But if you are a person who goes, hey, Bob, why do you give a fuck? You know, if two men are in love with each other, like they clearly they're not pretending like I don't care if obviously I have tattoos everywhere. I don't care if you want to get tattooed. If you want to get tattooed, get tattooed. If you want to be like fuckin Takeshi's six or nine, that dipshit, and cover your face with flowers.  I don't care. You do what you want to do and let's be on. Twenty years ago, tatoos, that was like, oh, you're a bad boy, or like you're some kind of bad person, right?  Crazy sailor or something.  Yeah, but some some people will look at other people's choices that don't affect them at all and decide that somehow or another it's an affront to their values. Well, you have two men are in love with each other and they decide to get married somehow or another that affects you. I don't understand how it affects you any more than I understand. Someone wearing shorts versus pants affects you or someone driving a red car versus a black car. It's nonsense. It's not your life.  If somehow or another people being in a man, being in love with a man and marrying a man or being with a man and living, you know, having a relationship if somehow or another that like killing all the trees, you know, I'm saying and like cause gas prices spike and then you have a case like all of a sudden there was something wrong.  But that's not the case. No. So what the fuck do you care?  So as a person who believes in liberty, I feel like you hear all these Republicans that talk about liberty. And, you know, I believe in liberty and I believe that. Well, that's liberty, motherfucker. Yeah, motherfucker. Letting someone do what they want to do, that's liberty.  It's not like gay is.  It's this idea that somehow or another, it's not a real thing to things on God and religion. I think religion is looking really bad right now. You know, if you believe that's great, but it's looking really bad because you're contradicting yourself all over the.  Let me stop you right there. This is the same as you saying white people. When you say religion is looking really bad, that's the same as saying white people look really bad.  It's a giant generalization. You're true. Very true. And I take that back some religious people. Yes, I'm looking very bad right now. But do you know why?  Because they're scared. But how can you look?  How are they looking bad? In what way? Well, I'm saying. For instance, God, I hate to make this political because I'm not that do I stay away from the little too late but Trump, for instance?  OK, let's look at let's look at his past.  Let's look at there's proof him lying pretty much every day. So for religious groups to support this man, you're contradicting your whole.  Yeah, I think that falls into what we were talking about earlier, this this political ideology that, like, he is with us, you know, he is against abortion.  He is against certain things, but is actually pro-gay. You know, Donald Trump is one of the weird things about Trump is before he ran for president, he was universally liked. You know, rappers used to talk about him in their songs.  Well, he was always on talk shows and, you know, he would go on Letterman and shit and he would even go on those talk shows and like talk shit about Rosie O'Donnell. And people thought it was funny and now it's horrendous.  It's like the same things that he has always done.  Now, when you're in a position of being the president, you're supposed to be a different person, but you don't feel there's a contradiction where church is right now. Oh, well, certainly with people that look, there's a lot some churches.  Excuse me, let me rephrase that.  Some people at some churches, there's a lot of people that will support values that are contrary to what they supposedly believe in, if that made them politically, if it helps them.  Look, there's a lot of churches that make a lot of money and then they don't pay taxes. That, to me, is one of the most offensive things about religion. The idea that Joel Osteen should have a giant arena and fly around in private jets and live in a castle, live in the mansions or that what's that other guy the fuck in the covid be gone.  What's that guy's name again?  Kenneth Copeland. That motherfucker, that guy is got you know, he had bought Tyler Perry's private jet and shit. He's a baller, right? He's he's a baller for God. The idea that that guy doesn't pay taxes is offensive. And the idea that he really acts for God, like there should be not just an investigation, but there should be we should have a trial. We should have it. We should figure out, OK, is this a violation of the whole idea behind if I don't I don't agree with it at all, period.  I don't think that churches should be able to be exempt from taxes if they get services like we do. If they make exorbitant amounts of money and we know they do, they should have to pay taxes.  Sure, I agree with you 100 percent. But did you need some real clear evidence that they don't even act in accordance to their own belief system? There's real clear evidence that they don't even they're not even people that are really acting like a Christian. So they're not even acting in their own religious ideology, and yet they still don't have to pay taxes.  I agree with you 100 percent. And now I was watching TV and they can they can get a loan or get this tax. Is that where they can they can get money from this?  People aren't coming to the church, so they're not getting all that free, even though even though they're not paying taxes anyway, like my wife is like we watch the TV shows are so horrible. A lot of churches are going out of business because my wife is very religious and I go, why don't they use all the money they didn't pay on taxes to save the flock mansions and private jets? That's what I'm money left over. Pro pro working for Jesus.  Yes, for Jesus.  Here's what's interesting to me is my wife, when I made it, everybody reached out and they go, oh, God had your back. And the first thing I thought was, So you're saying God didn't have everybody, all 80000 people back. Like, that's messed up. That is messed up. That's messed up. Look, I'm a religious person, but I'm a religious person that ask questions. So why are you a religious person?  If you're asking questions, how far do you think you should be able to ask questions? OK, how far do you take it?  You're Christian. I believe in God. I don't know, Christian. Like I go to a nondenominational church. It's just when I'm hippie churches. No, it's not happening. I get it. No, no, no, no. It's in Burbank. It's called South Hills.  What's a Burbank Corson's hippie? It's in Burbank.  But I go to a church where, look, they they don't believe in hate and all that. But it's a thing where I certain people say certain things. And when I got all these messages, God had your back. God had your back. And I'm thinking about the dude I saw rolled out. Why didn't God have their back? He jerked off too much.  Did he really hurt or he jerked off thinking about guys to fuck you so wrong? I have no comment on that.  But it's true. It's like, why would God? I mean, why does God let babies die? Why did God let that little kid get stabbed?  The little Asian baby, well, two year old kid get stabbed.  Here's the question that nobody can answer for me is that if God gets all the applause for something great happening, she put all the blame for something bad happening. Because obviously, from what I'm told, look, I'm not a scholar on the Bible, but if something great happens, we all praise him, but we never tend to not.  Praise him or say we never tend to criticize him when a whole plane blows up, you know, or you know, and that's that's the only problem with the religion I have.  When you say you believe in God, where what does that mean to you? When you're saying that? When you say that, do you say that because it makes you feel better?  I feel this is what I feel is. I feel. Every every type of tribe before us, the ones that had religion or some type of thing they believed in, they survived, the ones that didn't cannibalize each other.  I think what religion does is it keeps people afloat and makes them feel like something better.  On the other side and I think it kind of it's the rule of law. It kind of keeps people on the right track. If nobody had religion, I feel we would cannibalize each other just from the past. We learn from the past. It's the same thing like tribes that didn't have anything to believe in. They they ate each other up.  Well, I feel like we live in a completely different world because the interconnectedness that we experienced today didn't exist before.  So today we have access to information and to the vast body of work that people have written about philosophy and ethics and morals.  And I think we we can understand why it's good to be a good person without having to invoke a higher power or some sort of divine spiritual entity that's watching over everything before. That wasn't the case before when we were establishing civilization. And we're moving from primitive groups that live in tribes, which we all came from.  Look, if we will, the one thing that we have to take into consideration is that we are here because some people did some really violent shit and they made it through because some other people were trying to do some violent shit to them. That that is why we made it here. We made it here to this day in 2020 because our ancestors were better at violence than the others. That's that's really the truth. I mean, there's no getting around it.  We we are a warlike race of beings that have consistently, throughout history, conquered each other and done awful, terrible things to each other and took over land and took over resources and took over cities and took over women.  I mean, this is what what people did that got them to this point and whatever we needed to get people to act in a more moral or ethical way, whether it's a higher power or whatever it is to get people from just stomping, just raping and pillaging their way across the world without any repercussions whatsoever. Whatever that is, I'm all for it. And it was religion.  And you could argue and I think many people probably successfully have. I'm not really aware of it, but I would imagine I'm not the first person to bring this up.  That religion is in many ways sort of a natural creation of the human mind, in the human psyche to try to move us past our primitive tribal monkey tendencies and move us towards some more cooperative way of existing.  Yeah, I think what religion gives order, some type of order, and a lot of people don't want to believe it's over when it's over.  Well, you know what order exists when you don't have religion, you have the order of might. And that's what you have in China.  In China, you have a religion and the religion is the state. I mean, that's I mean, China. People have religion over there. But the reality is what's what's running. China is a dictatorship.  It's a military dictatorship. And the king is the ruler. This is what they look towards and the state is the ruler.  And the law of the state.  I mean, they do horrible shit to their people over there and they do this horrible shit openly in front of everyone. And they still run a billion people.  Yeah, it's I mean, that's just my take on religion. But I also know the other side because any time I support something, also look at both sides. I'm not just blindly I know religion is cause more wars than anything as well.  I think people have caused more wars, but they're using religion.  Religion is a nice thing. OK, you're right, people cause wars, but they're using religion to cause those wars.  Well, they're using religion to get they have in the past use religion to get people to do horrible things. And, you know, this is the ah, this is the argument against fundamentalism. You know, that it exists. I mean, it existed in Christianity in the past.  You know, the Inquisition, you can go throughout the history of some horrific things that were done in the name of Christianity, some of the most horrific things ever.  But really, it's people doing these things.  And if they decide that their religion is is enforcing this behavior, then they can justify these things.  And you see this.  I mean, it's what you get with cults when OK, forget about religion. I mean, we can know whether or not a religion is a cult is, you know, I. Had a bit about it where, you know, a cult is created by one guy and that guy knows it's bullshit in a religion, that guy's dead. Hmm.  It's like that's the difference.  Yeah. So, like like, remember those people, the Heaven's Gate cult, they are more purple nightmares and they cut the balls off and they're waiting for and they kill themselves.  When the asteroid was coming, the butt of the comet was coming.  That is that that was a way where someone used something this crazy ideology and got people do ridiculous shit.  And you could say Jonestown was another example, that that was another cult. And it was where this guy figured out a way to talk these people into poisoning their brothers and sisters and then gunning down federal agents and killing people.  And they did it all because he had them convinced that this belief system that he was espousing was was accurate and correct.  What I don't understand, because, like I said, I'm religious, but I ask a lot of questions and I don't believe the bullshit. A lot of the bullshit, you know, well, makes you religion.  Then what religion then? I think I think I just want to believe there's something better and hopefully there's something guiding all of us to a better place after. I want to believe that. I want to believe that. I want to believe that, you know, if I were to die in that hospital bed, there's something or something. I mean something or someone looking over my family. Yeah. I just want to believe in good. I'm look, I'm all about positivity.  I'm all about love. So it's the thing where why not believe in it.  It's not going to hurt me believing in it. And if it does happen at the end, great. If you go to a different place, great. Now I will ask questions along the way. I will not blindly follow a church or religion. You know, I do investigations. I really look at the people that's involved with that church. What I don't understand is the people that blindly fall into these cults or churches that you just talked about, like I don't understand how your mind gets to a place where it's like no matter what they say, I'm down for it.  Well, other people would say people that are more skeptical than yourself or not interested in religion at all would say, well, we take it one step further. Like, why would you believe that? Like, why would you believe that there's some sort of a superpower that you've never seen any evidence of, some sort of a mass mythical mystical power that's looking out for everybody?  Like, why would you think that when there's no evidence that the evidence that we do have was evidence that people in community and in in friendship and love, that there's a great benefit to that and that we feel it. We experience it. Like when like I say today, I gave you a big hug.  Yeah. Like this. Love Yanchep. Absolutely. That's that's important for us. It means that's real. That means something. But it also means something because I want you to know that if you need me, I'm there. I want you to know this is what friendship is.  That's that's real, you know.  But the reality is, is there a God watching a doctor got killed by wild dogs yesterday in Georgia? Did you hear about this? Oh, yeah. There's packs of wild dogs running through Georgia right now.  It's always been an issue when people let dogs loose and dogs come feral and they don't have food, they stop being pets and they revert towards more, Wolf, like behavior.  I think it was Georgia.  I read it this morning. See if you can find that. I'll send it to you if you know, I certainly have it. I have one problem, seeing that the doctor was a doctor in Connecticut, I guess, but was it was his middle Georgia doctor found dead and then former Connecticut City doctor.  I'm sorry. So it's not Connecticut.  Sorry, middle Georgia doctor killed by a pack of wild dogs. You know, it's not OK.  She was in. Yeah. Yeah, so this lady. It was a lady it's not the first time I was confusing this, but there was a man who was killed by wild dogs in Georgia a couple of years ago, Dr. Nancy Shah, who was a doctor in Connecticut.  And three a.m. Thursday, they found her body. Oh, yeah. She was on the wrong side of the road and fuck, the engine was running, the door was open, they got out of the patrol car to investigate, found a female that was deceased in the ditch. The autopsy confirmed that she died after being attacked by animals. Police confirmed to the station, which gave the further details. Police are trying to find the roaming beasts. Interesting that they phrased it that way with The New York Post.  So roaming peace stocks. Well, packs of dogs, you know that that is when you just let dogs loose.  And they got if you ever had a feral animal. I had a feral cat once and a friend of mine and her boyfriend were living in this apartment complex. And there was like this thing where these cats got underneath the building and they had kittens. And so she rescued the kittens. She goes, Do you want one of these kittens?  Because she knew I had cats. I was like, oh, my God, let me let me see. So I went to her house, these little hissing little fucking balls of fur.  Like, I'm just laughing at the idea of you having a lot of cats. Yeah, that's funny to me. Three cats.  I have two now, but I had three at one point in time. So I, I take this cat in and it was crazy.  It's a little baby cat but it was like, like wild, I mean fucking wild.  Like you thought I was definitely going to kill it needed and then I would pick the cat up and it would start purring like immediately like loud.  I'm like so happy. And then I put it down and it hits me again.  This poor thing was wild and that cat was wild of the day. It died. I was the only one to catch it. You kept the cat.  I kept him for years. Yeah. Wow. My dog killed him.  Yeah. He got he talked some shit to my pet. My dog was like, oh really. Lose me. Check this out. Yeah.  Because he would, he would hiss at the dog and I guess you fucked with the dog one time. The dog's like, why is this goddamn thing in the house.  And he kept pissing in the house so like he would piss the house he would like especially was mad at the dog. He was like pissed near where the dog slept one day that I wasn't home dog. I just took him into his own hands. Or did you find a cat? Oh, no, no, no. I was home and he he killed two cats.  Oh, that dog. They're both cats that sick with them.  Pitbulls was in my 20s. I was a different man. But this cat, when I had him, I was the only one that could pet him.  I was the only one that could touch him. I could go up to him like, what's up, bro? And I going to give him a little pet. Then I could pick them up.  He would purr and but I was the only one, nobody else, anyone, anyone see.  So I was like, this motherfucker's going to eat me. And he just ran away from them. Yeah, it was weird, I thought, man.  But anyway, but my point is I had this other cat that's a rag doll like I have to rag dolls now. They're like fluff balls, man.  Like you pick them up, they just go limp. They're domesticated cats.  Like I have a domesticated dog. I have a golden retriever. You haven't met him.  You know, sometimes I see I see the walks. He's the best. He's the sweetest. I love him to death. I wake up in the morning. I made a video of it because it's so ridiculous. Like how my morning starts. Like he waits for me outside the door of my room.  I open the door and I go, bro, I go, what's up? And he just he runs around in circles. He always grabs a toy. I want to bring a toy over to me and then I'm petting zoo.  Whoo hoo hoo! He's always like he's moaning in ecstasy, wagging his tail, runs around in circles. He's domesticated. He's a love bug.  And he's like, this is everybody.  If you come over my house, that's what he's going to do to you is going to go, oh, no, he runs around circles around you, wants you to touch him. He'll drop to his belly. He dropped his back once you rub his belly.  But that's because of you, too, though. You domesticated him like that. Yes, for sure.  But he's also a golden retriever. Yeah. Like he's super nice.  There's the nicest dogs ever. But he's domesticated.  OK, wild cats are so different than domesticated cats.  It's like a different thing, man. It's a they're so different. Like he would hiss at anybody that come near him. Anybody you come near me. Like I had to bring him to the veterinarian to get him fixed. When he got he got to a certain point was spraying in the house with this motherfucker because that's what happens in Pakistan. Yeah. Yeah.  So the way I got him, I had to lock me in him in the bathroom together.  And then I have to throw I forget it was like a towel or a blanket or a bathroom. I forget what I threw on him.  But I because this is like a kidnapping. Like for real. Yeah.  And this is ninety six somewhere around there.  OK, so I throw this fucking blanket on this cat and then I have to grab him and wrestle and then I stuff him in a hamper and then I take him with a fucking duct tape hamper to Dr. Craig.  I am my veterinarian, OK? Why didn't you just get rid of Cat? I mean, I loved him and I felt like he was like me in a lot of ways that, you know, he just didn't didn't have anybody looked out for him like he was abandoned.  He felt I felt like in a lot of ways, like, look, I don't know my dad.  And because of that, I have this weird thing about taking care of things, taking care of people. I felt like I was a bear. I've spoken to my dad since I was seven years old and I knew him before that. So like all my life, I've sort of had this thing like, hey, that can happen.  Well, you could be abandoned. And it's one of the reasons why I've always had this very liberal and charitable outlook on things, even though, like a lot of people conserve, they'll confuse me with being conservative. I'm not very conservative with people because I know that things can go wrong with people. I also know that some people are lazy fucks and they need to go to work. They need to get their ass in gear and stop making fucking excuses.  But these are like little mental traps that people have fallen into. And oftentimes they just don't have the right tools. They don't have the right the right information to sort of make these corrections and adjustments.  So I'm a hard ass in some ways like that.  Like some people need to just get their fucking shit together. But I also I'm charitable in a way like I don't think they understand how to get their shit together. When you see someone who is obese and smoking cigarettes, a lot of that is education and information. And just the way their body has the way their life has gone, the things that have happened to them outside of their control before they even became a fully formed adult, just like this poor cat.  Yeah, this poor cat didn't ask to be shit out under a fucking apartment building like and then have, you know, this wild life where it's got to eat rats and shit and try to take care of itself.  Well, I also think that even people like me out here inspiring people and it kind of kickstarts you.  It kicks you in the ass and say, hey, you need to get it going. Like I told you about David Goggins last time I was here, I read his book and, you know, shit on my mirror, you know, and trying to make strides to.  But I think I think we all need that. It's not just lazy people, even people that are out there hustling. Oh, yeah. Sometimes you need that.  Oh, I need it. I need that time. Yeah. I'm very fortunate to know people like David or my friend JoCo JoCo Willink, who's very similar as well. Like he's got a video that he put up today, go to go to Choco's Instagram and he puts these up all the time. He gets up at four thirty in the morning every day. It seems that takes time, I'm sure, of his watch for him.  It's a time David Garcons to four thirty. Does he get up at four thirty every morning, stretches for two hours and then he hits his run. He's an animal. But play this. This is JoCo. So easy. So easy. Dripping with sweat, so easy to say you're going to do it tomorrow. Well, I want you to reprogram your brain and tell yourself that tomorrow is not a viable option. Tomorrow doesn't work. You do it today, you get it done today.  That's what you do. Have a good Monday, y'all go get some out, that's all you need, need people like that in the world to follow this dude, you should follow.  Who is he? That's Chocho Willink. He's a former Navy SEAL who is one of the most inspirational people I've ever met in my life. And he now he he writes books on leadership and Brazilian jujitsu, blackbelt and, you know, every morning fucking gets up before 3:00 in the morning. Trains take a takes a photo of his wife, takes an aftermath photo of puddles of sweat on the ground and the tools used, and then takes pictures of the sunrise and sunset, the beach that he earned.  He earned his right to go. Look at that.  Wow. Yeah. I wake up at four thirty two every morning. Do you. Yeah, I do. But mine would have been like, check out me. Drinking is modulatory.  Get it.  Yeah well it takes every kind of people that song you know song about that.  Yeah. There's, there's, there's all kinds of people in this world and it's ok, it's OK to be a soft person, it's ok to be a gentle person. You don't have to be this fucking savage like Chocho.  But it's something that Navy seal. Yeah. They're just wired. Well it's it's not it's not for everybody know it's most people are going to ring that bell. Most people are not going to do it.  Could you have made it? I don't know. I would say I would tell you right now if you asked me. Yes, but of course I would say that. Yeah, I don't know unless you've done it. You don't know.  Like, in my early 20s, I would have loved. Now, if I could go back, I would have loved to try to be a Navy SEAL.  But I guess if you don't have it, like if you didn't have that desire.  But I just think, like whether or not it's challenging yourself, whether, you know, whether or not you can push yourself past the place that most people quit, that's a big part of what it is.  You know, the big part of anything is being able to push. Right. When you get discomfort, people, you will just want to back off. They won't stop there. It's a thing that we have a natural inclination to seek comfort. You have to have the mind to push past that.  I don't know mentally, you know, if, like, I was working so hard because those two days in the hospital when I said if there was that eject button and then your mind just like, no, keep pushing, keep pushing, keep pushing. And after three and a half days, finally everything started. My lungs in the fluid in my lungs started to settle.  But it's it's amazing what you learn when you come out of a of a situation like that.  It's it's what you value.  Like I've told it, I'm a changed person now, like, from that.  And I think and I hate to be cliche, but you appreciate the little things.  Like, I never I've always been a good guy, a hustler. But just opening my eyes in the morning.  It's a different game now, right? You have a gift? I have a gift at the gift.  Yeah. And a lot of your your fans say, hey, it wasn't your time. You got great things to to accomplish. And I really believe that because I see the death total going up and I go, oh, I'm not. I'm here for a reason.  And I think when we go through life, you had a down point, you know, but you need something to get you back on track and say, yo, you're lucky you're still here. You need like I've always valued my family. I'm a family guy. But now it's like, oh, you want to go for a swim, let's go for a swim. You tell my son you want to do this, let's do this.  And I think it kind of lit a fire under my ass where I was.  I wasn't coasting. I was I was doing well.  But I just appreciate everything and I appreciate people more, you know, because, man, when I was laid up in the hospital, I saw comics and different people drop off shit to my house through the ring cam. And I can't tell you how much that meant to me, you know what I mean?  Like like just people going out of their way, you know, to to make sure your family is OK.  And even the text, even the DBMS, those little things like when nothing tragic has happened in your life, I don't think you really appreciate you like.  OK, that's great. You know, but then when something happens to you and these people don't know you, but they're reaching out, giving you positive vibes and then people you know really well give me those vibes. It means a lot if you don't understand how much it meant.  When I was laying in a hospital bed fighting for my life after I got over that hump to read all these positive message from your fans, from comedians, from from close friends, I mean, it it really pushes you to live.  Hmm. You know, the power of word is so much to me now. Expresses something.  Yeah. Yeah. Expresses something that you understand how close you came to losing everything.  Yeah. Yeah. I think.  Look, comfort is wonderful in civilization is wonderful and love and friendship is all wonderful, but I think to really appreciate it, you almost have to at least almost have everything taken away or know it can be taken away or know how fortunate you are, know how lucky you are. I mean, look, man, all throughout human history was impossible to take a fucking shower, you know, I mean, to take a hot shower.  Wilfork did that. Like, when did that first start? With one hundred years ago. Well, when when was it. Yeah. So people have been around for, what, hundreds of thousands of years in this relatively similar form.  And then like one hundred years ago, someone figured out how to turn that thing, hot shower.  And now this is just the way it's supposed to be.  Yeah, dude, I went camping with me and Brian Cowen. We went camping in Montana.  We did this hunting show and we back in 2012 and it was freezing out cold shit, nine degrees at night and you're in a sleeping bag and huddled and and then finally after like six or seven days, whatever it was, we got to Billings and it was the end of the trip. We had a successful trip and then we got to a hotel.  I took a shower, a hot shower. And it was like, oh, bullshit hotel, too. Like wood paneled walls.  Just a skanky fucking weirdo hotel. Ordinarily, if I was a comic, like, working in that town, I was like, oh, look at this shithole. I'm staying. Yeah. I'm like, well, guess I'm roughing it. Here we are. But for me it was like heaven. I was in that shower. Oh so warm the water was so good. And to feel that the soap and get the stink off me hadn't washed myself in seven days, it's like oh you really appreciate it.  You don't appreciate it until you lose it, until it's gone. And I think that struggle is something that too many people are missing, you know, and I like to give myself my own struggle. You know, it's one of the reasons why I work out so hard, because I when I work out hard, not just because it calms me down and it makes it it does whatever vanquishes, whatever demons are inside me through exercise.  But also I appreciate peace because when I push myself, I push myself in a ferocious, horrific way where I'm fucking exhausted, like when I'm running hills or I'm hitting a bag or whatever I'm doing.  I'm doing it hard, man, so that when it's over, I mean, I'm hands on my knees heaving.  And then the rest of the day is beautiful because I made my own bullshit instead of like dealing with, like, fucking hordes of barbarians coming over the hills or, you know, starving to death or all the real problems that people have dealt with throughout history that have kind of balanced out their perspective. I created myself.  I think I think today's society is taking away challenges. Yes. You know, it's not pushing people because it's fine being fine today. Right. You know, there's no like one thing interesting.  You said to me last podcast we did you go, you know, yo, you really never knew exactly said it. You never been through any struggle because I was telling you my life has been pretty good. And you go, what makes you and you would never take away your struggle when you were younger because it made you who you are today, you know, and after going through something like what I went through, it's changed me so much that I know that struggle is going to change the rest of my life.  It's even the mentality of myself has already changed. It's like I'm going to take risk. I'm going to, because you never know how long you're going to be here. I know that's cliche, but you really never know.  The key is to keep that mentality. Yes.  The problem is for a lot of people, they slip right back into comfort again, slip right back into the regular life, because this this close call you had with death, it slips away and your memory becomes the thing of the past was four years ago or five years ago.  And, you know, like, oh, I'm having a hard time getting motivated. I'm having a hard time getting to the gym. I mean, I really like my career in order. But it's hard. I mean, sometimes I'm depressed is I just feel so blue.  I sit around the house when you're not supposed to make it and then no one wants to say that to those people. But that mentality literally is like if life is this wild rush to the finish line, I'm not sure it is. But if it was, those people are not supposed to make it. They're not supposed to cross the tape. They're supposed to sit back at mile three and take a nap. That's just and it's also supposed to be a lesson to you, the person who keeps going to see, like, see these lazy bitches that they ruin their life and wind up falling apart.  And if they keep exhibiting these self-destructive behavior, don't do that. You don't have to do that. You see them do it, learn from them, learn from the people that cry for no reason, learn from the people that fall apart, learn from the people who don't know how to pick themselves up and keep going. But you can't. You can't say that out loud today, you can take.  You can, but to know more people need to say, but you're so right, like like the people who's talking, who's attacking those people, the people on the sidelines, the people that sit down.  It's true. You, Michael, you you don't even know Michael. Yo, yo, I get depressed.  Look, some I think some people have real problems, real issues.  Some people, some people but some people lazy fucks fucks and use it as an excuse.  A lot of people I think there's way more because there's a natural inclination to do that. And to deny that natural inclination to do that is to exhibit ridiculous lack of understanding about human nature, because that's what people do.  We know that this is you'd be you is either willful ignorance or you're purposely lying.  So you fit in the group the same way we were talking about earlier about ideologies that people slip into because it gives you comfort.  This is like when people like there was a there was a video recently where were an article recently where Adele lost a lot of weight and all these.  Why do people celebrate that? I was so pissed off about that. It's people that celebrate it or, you know, people that celebrated her weight loss. It's like these are the same people are like, you look good no matter what size you are.  I'm like, so like it's an interesting perspective. That's not what I was saying. No, no. But but what I'm saying is, to me, the celebrity audience that celebrated her losing the weight was saying you same people that say you should feel great no matter what size you are. I think it's sent out the wrong message.  Well, I think it's great to lose weight because when you lose weight, you get healthy. But there was a lot of people that were saying that we shouldn't do that because of one.  One thing that I read that was hilarious was saying that it's actually fat phobic to celebrate her weight loss because we don't know what she's going through. She might actually be going through a hard time right now because she just got divorced. And maybe that's why she's losing weight, because she's not doing well and she's ill no more.  She works out and doesn't eat cake.  Like, my whole thing is, if you're going to I just hate who hate people.  And this is a lot of celebrities and this is a lot of it's like no matter what size you are, we love you. Right. And then a girl lose weight and then you really see who they are. Oh, you look great. Now we love you. But I understand. I understand no matter what size you are, I do love you. Like I have friends that are fat. Yeah. I love them, you know, and I've talked to some of them try to get them to lose weight, but I don't want to lose weight.  But if they did lose weight, I'd be like, dude, you look great. Congratulations.  It's healthier. Yes, but I still love them no matter what size.  I understand that. But someone because but to me, it's a wrong message. Like if you're going to say you love me no matter what size you are like and I'm talking this is more celebrity driven. Is this listen to celebrities, bro.  It's just that this is more Katy Perry, how to live your life. You got to run around in circles like a fucking dog. That dude, I'm not that dude. I know. What I'm saying is you don't put out this message that body image doesn't really matter. And then when a girl loses weight, you're like, oh, it really does matter. Like you're just contradicting yourself. So why are you just like me? I don't care if Adele's big or small, you know, I do.  Well, OK, I to look hot. That's good. There's good now.  I like it as long as she can sing that's all I.  Yeah well I do care about that but I care when anybody loses weight because it gives people inspiration the same way that JoCo video you know, say that gives people inspiration same way Goggins that gives people inspiration. Those people are important and Adel's important doing that man. How many women that were overweight looked at her and were like, I'm going to fucking get my shit together now. What's that other girl?  Rebel. Rebel Wilson. What? She did a movie. She lost a ton of weight. Oh, yeah. That girl looks really good now. She's lost a ton of weight and then same thing. The lazy fatso's they want to stay lazy fatsos. They get mad like she you're just defining beauty standards. And she's she was amazing before. And you know, it's not good to be skinny. And there's a bunch of people out there that will come up with any fucking reason why they can just eat cake.  No, it's not real. Look, my thing is, as long as you're healthy, some people are healthier.  But like my thing is, if you go to a doctor and you're you're too big and they say, hey, you're not healthy right now, you know, you need to change it, that's terrible for you. But if you're a little bigger and you're healthy because I know some big people that are healthy, I bet you don't. I do. I bet you don't. I bet you know, big people that would be healthy if they lost weight.  But they're not healthy if they're fat.  I mean, obesity is one. I'm not talking about obese. I mean, they're just big people. OK, like like the football players. Yes. OK, well, that's different. That's that's what I'm. Yeah. Oh well that's what I'm talking about.  But you look a little better if they had six pack that's.  Right. OK, you know, that's what I don't mean. Yeah, OK. Yeah, I thought you're talking about like, no, I'm talking about bigger play Scrabble.  Before she lost all the weight, she was obese. Yeah, yeah. I'm just saying it's a thing where Ralphie May. Ralphie May. Oh yeah. I mean, I was I know so many people. Went to Ralphie May. It was like, dude, you got to lose weight. Oh, I was one of them. You have to, man. Yeah, but he had an issue. There was a there was whatever the wiring of his mind.  It didn't it didn't it wasn't gonna work.  He was going to eat and he was going to keep eating and whatever it was, I don't know what the demon was, but whatever his demon was he and I don't think maybe he could have shifted and changed.  And people have. But it didn't happen while he was alive. I tell you, one of the nicest men ever. He was a great guy. He's a great guy. I I went to Nashville with Sarah Tiana and he took us.  And of course, we're like, oh, let's just say how he goes.  No, we're going to go to his breakfast place. He takes us to the best biscuit place in Nashville, Tennessee.  But it was just him like hearing about me and coming out and hanging out just as a comic.  He was a sweetheart. Yeah, he was a sweetheart of a guy. It's it was a sad loss that no one was surprised by. Yes, that's the problem. You know, it's like if you have a friend and that friend is an alcoholic and they die of liver cancer, you've got to go.  You know, I love them.  Great guy. But no one's shocked that that was the result. And that's the same thing with obesity. It's like no one's shocked when you you do that to your body and then you wind up dying. It's not it's not shocking. Not so sad. It comes with it. I just think I know what you're saying about the celebrity thing is.  But I really think that it's it's along the lines what we were talking about before with religion and political ideologies.  People that are celebrities feel like they're putting out this thing that helps their image. And the thing is, you can't say anything even remotely controversial. If they do, people come down on you. And if you're going to say something controversial, it should be controversial that leans towards the side of being liberal and being open minded and being compassionate. And I don't think that being dishonest about the real negative health consequences of being fat is positive. I think it's negative.  I think ultimately, if you can look fat shaming is a real thing, right? People get mad when people fat shame. But let me tell you something. When someone fat shames you and you feel bad, you lose weight if you want to act on that. A lot of people do. It's a bad feeling. That bad feeling makes you feel like shit and you go out and you do something about it.  The reason why they make you feel like shit is because it works or you got to take the other salicornia that some people feel worse and then do awful things to themselves.  Well, those people need to get their shit together. But look, when people make you feel bad and then you make correction, look, if someone said to me right now, hey, you're fat, I be like, OK, that doesn't work. Yeah, you can say whatever you want. It's not going to get in there. But if I was a little fat and I have been in the past, I've had a little bit of a gut before and someone says you're fat, like, oh, OK, I got to lose weight.  Yeah, but you push it. But it would only push for years.  If I kept going for years then I would be obese. But that's what it is.  You get on a path, but it only pushes people that want to be pushed. You see what I mean. Like sort of it's not sort of people that it goes back to the lazy thing. Yeah. It doesn't work on lazy people.  Well, there's a lot of work now that neither is education, neither does anything.  I mean, lazy people, that the inclination towards laziness, it's it's a part of the spectrum of human behavior.  And it's a bad I mean, it's a bad thing. It doesn't do anybody any good. It's so it's so unattractive.  Have you ever had a girlfriend that was lazy? Yes, bro.  See, you said that. Yes. Look, I. You said it. Oh, my God. It's so unattractive. It's unattractive to girls, is unattractive to guys. Having a significant other that's lazy is offensive.  I tell you what, if Twitter and Instagram people going after people, if there was work involved with doing that, if you actually actually had to go through steps and work to do that, you would have no comments.  Right. Like if people actually had to work to put a comment up. Yeah. Oh, it would decrease by 90 percent.  Well, a lot of what comments are is lazy. It's it's people on their comments being lazy, going, oh, let me comment about him or fuck her.  But people in your life that are lazy, it's it's very unattractive and it makes you angry. If you're not lazy and someone's lazy, the dragging you down, like if you're in business with someone and that person's lazy, it's her friend. Get away. It's offensive.  Yeah. And if you're like if you have a business together and you know, this is your partner and your partner is fucking off and not doing the stuff they're supposed to do when you tell them, hey, we've got to take care of X, Y and Z, I don't want to do that. Like, oh my God, I'm in business with this fucking lazy fuck that. That's a terrible feeling.  But if you're in business with someone and they're like, I'm on it, let's get this, let's do that. Hey, maybe we can do that to fuck. Yeah, let's push each other. All right, let's go. Let's get it together. High five woo. And then, like, you feed off each other. People don't want that, though. A lot of people don't want that. They don't want to be something people don't. Lazy people don't want.  What's amazing to me, when my wife was pregnant, we were, you know, second time with our what? Our girl.  That's five months now, but. I was reading stories about mothers being shamed for losing weight so fast.  I've heard that other folks get mad if you're not big now, you're shaming people for being skinny. Like literally people will get in shape after two months, three months after working out.  Mm hmm. You know, and they're like, well, you're not spending any time with your kids since you're in shape. Now, you've been working out showing all these videos. It's like that's an hour a day. Yeah. Your kid sleeps 18 hours a day when they're first born. Yeah. You know, you're taking an hour for yourself and you're getting women get shamed for losing. I'm like, now this is we're just shaming people for no reason.  It's just a bunch of people talking. And the problem is it used to be you had to be around those people to hear it. Yeah. Now those dumb fucks, they put it on Facebook and the whole world to read it. And then other fat fucks chime in, too.  Yeah, I agree. He's nothing wrong with it and he has been complaining to get rid of them, just stuffing their fat face with cake while they're writing it, while they're typing it.  I don't, I just mean towards lazy people too.  When you say things like that it's fun because I enjoyed that.  Yeah. Lazy people know they're lazy too. Yeah.  And that's what's great about it. Like coming up with excuses for why you're wrong.  Guess what, this whole segment right now about the lazy. Yes. People are really mad that are lazy. Only lazy people only lazy poor JoCo approves this.  Oh just Noguez is like that's what I'm talking about. Approves all those people approve. Look I my friend campaigns that fucking do works a full time job, works for the Department of Water and Power in Oregon. He gets up every morning. He doesn't have a day where he doesn't run six miles every day. He's run ten miles oftentimes will run a marathon a day. He runs ultramarathons. He runs these fucking 240 mile races that take three days, which is a full time job, also one of the best both hunters in the world.  And every day you go to his Instagram, every day it's him lifting weights, him running. It's him talking. It's him saying, have a great day, everybody. He's got a different approach to JoCo. He's not screaming. You know, failure is not an option. He's got a different approach. But that motherfucker gets after it every single day.  So if you ever feel like like, oh, you know, I think I do too much. Go to campaigns, go to his Instagram page, Cameron Haynes, Cameron, hands on Instagram and you go, oh, I don't fucking do anything. No, you shit. This kid's got a full time job and a family.  You realize when you think you do a lot. Yeah. You'll find people to do way more than you and you're like, oh, I'm fucking lazy compared to that person if you think you do a lot.  David Goggins is running right now.  Right now. Running screen screen motherfucker screaming. Screaming. Oh yeah. Yeah, man.  I mean, but those those kind of people that let you know that there's more on the table, you get more out of your life, you can you could squeeze out more. It's not for everybody like that. It's not for everybody, but for everybody. Doing your best is something that you should strive for, for everybody, whatever that best is. I mean, man, if you want to just do yoga three or four days a week or something like that, and that's all you like to do physically, that's great, too.  You don't have to be that guy who runs a hundred miles. No, you don't have to be that guy that said like JoCo four o'clock and the one throwing kettlebell is around like a savage. You don't have to. You don't have to. But you should do something to push yourself. And there's a great value in that. There's great reward in that. And there's no reward in talking shit on moms who lose weight too quickly because they're dedicated and healthy and they work out.  And also, it's first of all, there's a reality to that, too. With moms, it's not fair. I know moms who are like fitness enthusiasts that gained a lot of weight during their pregnancy and they have a really hard time losing it. Their body just doesn't bounce back like other people's bodies. Some women are just savages. Like two weeks later, they got a flat stomach, did a lot look at this.  But as genetics as well, it's genetic. So you can't blame a person because they've got good genetics and they've been working out.  Right. And you also can't blame someone as bad genetics either and not lose it.  But but here's I feel bad for women because if they're a little bit too big, they get criticized. If they lose weight now, you're too skinny.  Yeah, but you're only getting the skinny thing. You're only getting it from dumb, fat, lazy bitches.  They get mad at you. Oh, I can't see it coming from dudes. I can't see it do go. Hey, you know, you got too hot to quit fucking whore.  Like know that's not that's due to do that.  The anger is going to come from people that are unlucky genetically and that that is. But you can't point to them and be mad at them. No. There was this one lady, though, that she took a whole lot of shit because she had a kid and she posted her being pregnant. And then she posted what she looked like a couple months later working out. And she was saying, don't be lazy. And then all I remember that.  And people got mad and lost their shit and. She was like, this is her thing.  Yeah, like you're going to her to look at her pay, but that's a different thing because she's clearly got a great genetic roll of the dice and she's shitting on those women that don't have that.  Don't be lazy. Well, listen, some women are not lazy. Some women, they get pregnant and it takes months and months for them to learn.  And it's hard and it's a struggle. And other girls or they just bounce back like a rubber band. It's crazy. It's not fair, but life's not fun. Some dudes are seven feet tall with giant dicks. It's not a goddamn thing you could do about that. Can you imagine being seven feet tall with no dick?  Oh, Debbie. Horrible w horrible disappointment in a woman like.  Oh, I'll forget it. Tonight is like like terrible or even a regular dick. Yeah, just a regular day. It would look weird. Oh my God. I haven't thought about it that much, but that would be weird.  Yeah, but if Shaq had a regular what in the hell is that. You know, new, everything else is enormous.  Size 40 shoe a hand as big as this table.  A regular deck. What like what just happened. That's outrageous. Yeah, but life's not fair genetically. It's just not it's not fair intellectually. It's not fair genetically. It's not fair with the parents.  You don't you don't get you know, there's some people that are extremely fortunate with their parents.  Oh absolutely. Yeah. I mean, my parents are great. Yeah. Like still married. Yeah. And like they love me and I love them and we talk all the time. But I know a lot of friends that parents are divorced or had only one parent growing up and that's a struggle they they had to deal with. And my struggle was different. Yeah.  You know, so you're right.  Life is not fair. Life is not fair. No, it's not fair. Some people are born into it. Fair. You should be nice and people should be fair. But circumstances are not fair. There's really good people that get hit by cars every day, hundreds wonderful people that get leukemia. And this idea that somehow or another that it's not you know, it's not supposed to happen that way. Like there's there's something wrong. Someone fucked up.  There's no it's just the randomness of life is not fair.  And also the fact that, look, you don't live that long. Now you're talking to a 52 year old man. I'm 52 years old. Even saying that I'm like that can't be real. Like you ever seem real.  You ever wonder, like, I got another 25, 30 years?  No, I get up and I just do it. I just get up and do it every day. That's what I do. I live in the moment. Get up and do it every day.  Well, at the moment, as much as I can, I think my thing is to push me because I always have goals. Every day too is the push me is like, yo, I'm halfway done. I got to get it, you know, like that's just my motivation.  There's a difference between being fifty today and being fifty. And in the past, there's a great picture of one of the Golden Girls that said it says like fifty in nineteen eighty five and then it has a picture of Jaylo swinging on a pole. It's like fifty in twenty twenty. It's fucking different man. There's people exercise today. People take care of their bodies today and they never didn't write as long as you never went through this period. We slacked off and ate cake and slept all day.  If you never went through that period of alcoholism and drug abuse where you wrecked your body, man, you know, you could hold on a lot longer than anybody ever thought you could. Yeah.  What's crazy to me is when I was growing up, dads look like dads. Yeah, their dad was. Yeah, dad. But but just. Yeah, yeah. The body. But just physically they look like a dad where today you go you couldn't tell who's a dad who's single. Everybody taking care of themselves. Right.  It's a different world. Yeah. But it's education. It is. People understand that now.  They understand like hey, you really do need to do something.  It's not an option whether or not you exercise. If you want to be a healthy person, it's a mandatory thing that you need to do.  When you. Speaking about healthy when you were in Florida, I want to talk about well, in Florida, it's being wealthy. Yeah, well, yeah, right. Florida is the most unhealthiest place in the world.  When you were going back and forth, did you, like, kind of stay away from people in airports or.  No, I didn't stay away from people. So you mean I took pictures with some people, was a little weirded out by it, like maybe I shouldn't be doing this, but my my take on it was, you know, wash your hands, don't do anything stupid. Don't anybody cough on your anything like that. Like everybody I was around for the most part other than the people in the hotel. Everyone was tested.  All the people that you see were tested, all the fighters you tested, all the workers and everyone was tested. And, you know, in the hotel, everybody had masks on. All the people like Ed Morton's Steakhouse was very nice. Sit down. Me and my face had mask on, too. Yeah. Me and my buddy Eddie Bravo were sitting there eating a meal like like a grown up.  But this is amazing. It's like the real world again. Is there anybody in the restaurant? There was a couple other people.  Yeah, there was one older couple, no mask and some young people at the bar, no masks.  I tell you, when I first got out, when they first cleared me in my neighborhood because everybody knew, like, literally I would walk outside and go for a walk, like they would run inside their house.  What if their kids were outside playing? They would call them in to go inside. Like I was like this. I went to my I'm not going to say the name of the coffee place, but I went to my local coffee place. And since I didn't post, I was cleared.  They the manager of the store sent me a nasty on my Instagram, sent me a nasty man. How could you endanger all our workers by coming in? And you have Korona. This is after three weeks of being cleared and it's almost like you're being you had been tested, never been tested.  And everything I've been cleared. And it's a thing I got. Test manager said that the manager reached out to me personally on my second to them.  Yeah, I called I called their district manager and goes, this is this is prejudice. Like, I've been cleared for three weeks and I have a manager just because I didn't post that, I was cleared on Instagram. It's also shitty.  It's very shitty, shitty way to approach someone who almost died.  Yeah, I was so angry and they were scared I was going to sue and I just sent you free coffee.  I didn't ask for shit scared you're going to sue. Yeah, they were scared. It was it was really bad and I was angry. But then I saw it like on my street, like I was a plague.  Like people like literally was running side alleviated or that. Oh, no, now it's fine.  Now it's fine.  Now me, I'm trying to stay away from people who don't know I feel good because I took that immunity test and they said I had the long immunity.  So I don't know the. But there's a long immunity and a short immunity. It's IJI and I, it's summer and this is the antibodies.  There's an antibody test you can take at this place called Next Health, where it's not FDA approved, but it shows you like your Stran. Is it long? Immunity is a short immunity. And they said I had long immunity because it was so bad.  Usually sounds like you went to a fortune teller, but look at your man Gypsy's looking at your hand. But but it said, like, usually the people that get it the worst, this is your life.  You got long. This long, you will live off the people that get it the worse of long immunity, longer immunity. But it works just like the flu, like all the mist where masks don't wear a mask. To me, it was all bullshit at the beginning. It's like, why wouldn't you tell everybody wear a mask?  I posted something on my Instagram today. That was from 60 Minutes. I guess it was like last month. I think it was last month. Dr. Fauci from March somewhere. Yeah.  He's saying you don't have to wear masks. Look, don't. Unless you have something. Yes. That makes no sense.  Going to protect you. There's a cool mask that I saw that's advertised, though, that they they set this mask up, this mask like seals to your face. They set this mask up in this tube and they blew cigarette smoke into the tube. And then on the other side of the mask, it was clear.  Yeah, it's but the whole mask thing is like if, you know, they knew people were asymptomatic back then. So you're saying only the people with problems need to wear a mask like you.  But, you know, people are asymptomatic and they didn't know how many people are asymptomatic, but now they realize as many as 78 percent of people who catch this are asymptomatic, but really crazy, even if you know three percent, but they know it back then.  They just they did they didn't really know who was doing this. Oh, yeah. They knew people were asymptomatic, but they were. When did they know this?  Oh, man. I mean, who knows? This is March. I think that Foushee was on 60 Minutes, but they had reports that people like in February were asymptomatic.  This is what I'm hearing. They knew in February that people were conflicting information.  But part of the problem. But regardless if you know, OK, they did know this, they knew people could get it by droplets in March. They did know that. And so people can get it in droplets.  Why would you have the only people that are having symptoms wear a mask? If you can get in droplets, that means if I'm healthy, I can get it from your droplets.  We'll see what it means. Everybody. Everybody can get everybody. So why wouldn't you just say, well, everybody, we're much confusion.  You know, the World Health Organization in January tweeted that according to China, it cannot be transmitted from person to person. That was in January. It changes so much, but the World Health Organization has been in bed with China from the beginning, and it's really a big part of the problem with this is that the disinformation that the Chinese government had put out to try to alleviate some of the blame. I mean, that's that's their game. Their game is Levia blame and take control of the narrative.  And so the World Health Organization was in bed with them. I mean, that's why Trump, although it's widely criticized that he stopped funding to the World Health Organization, this is his rationalization for that, like they have done terrible things. What also fits his narrative, though, too.  But but it's true, isn't it is true. And it fits his narrative. If it didn't fit his narrative, he wouldn't have took the money away.  The narrative of the World Health Organization.  Yes, it's their fault that we're in health organizations fault.  It's their fault that we're in this, even though we knew about it before it got here. We did know about it before it got there. But the World Health Organization did say that in January.  The hundred percent. Yeah. Have you seen the tweet?  Because it's pretty crazy when you read it today.  It's like, wow, like this is just a few months ago. Yeah.  This is for four and a half months ago that they said this and then you're looking at it like, oh, Christ.  I mean, my thing is just going back to March six, 11 deaths and just a short amount of time, over 80000 Montaño as one.  We need to go to Montana. I know that's what I'm saying, so I'm all up in all of it. He just opened up the restaurant again. Do you if you had to guess when I mean, you do like arenas, but for normal comedians like me to do like clubs, what do you think?  Well, I want to I'm home, OK? I'm hoping we could do clubs soon.  I mean, I'm really hoping we can get things going in California again, but. Ah, you know, Bill Maher had a great rant about it, it was really good stuff if he got any any problems. Why we can't plan it.  But Bill Maher had a really good rant that the key to this is not going to be stay at home forever.  No, this is not not is not how the immune system works. The key is having a healthy body. And this idea that your body doesn't know what to do with this, your immune system has never experienced that. Your immune system, if it's functioning correctly, it will fight this off. Your your situation shows that your immune system was dragged down.  I mean, that's what my doctor said. My immune system I was opposite. My immune system was so strong it caused problems. It overreacted.  Well, this was the reason why they think hydroxy chloroquine works, right. It stops that cytokine storm that happens from your immune system overreacting in the case.  That's what they said at the time. I don't like I don't they don't know. But my doctor was like, but you were run down. I was run down. So that's your immune system running down. Yeah, but from what my doctor said is my immune system was in overdrive. But like I said, I don't I don't really know at all.  I no problem. No, there's no clear answer.  Like, I go like every four hours I go all this bullshit and everyone's going to be fine. We're going to and then four hours later we're all going to die.  Yeah. It's like that's that's what it was like in March and March. There was so much conflicting information.  I didn't know whether or not we're going to be OK or not. The the doctor I talked to said he had a patient that was rolling out about 60 percent oxygen level and you're supposed to be between like 94 and 100. And the guy didn't even know his oxygen. He was just acting normal. And they said that's the thing that's confusing doctors right now. It could be like you're climbing a mountain, but you're not breathing hard. You're just normal.  So that's why they, I believe, climbing a mountain so you can be exercising while that was happening.  No. Well, no, no, no. What I'm saying is the same oxygen levels you would get from climbing a high like sixteen.  Well, I think the problem is so many people do so little with their body that even when although we're saying asymptomatic for a lot of these people, it's like they don't ever push themselves. So they don't even know their body is.  No, no, no. So weekly. No, what they're saying is, is on this part is the oxygen level in a person that would come in with Korona was at 60 percent. Yes. But they were they were functioning like it was at ninety four ninety where they're supposed to be passed out. Right.  But they're not exercising. No, but but you hear what I'm saying then?  What I'm saying is they don't push themselves to the point where they find out that their bodies at 60 percent, if you're a person who exercises all the time and you're used to you're in tune with your body and then you're working now you're like, God, I'm fucking dragging ass. That happened. My friend's son, he had it. And the way they found out it, his mom had it, but he had it in the way found. I was like dragging aspirin.  He's working out.  Oh, I see what you're saying. I see. Because when you push yourself, that's what you find out. If you just kind of struggling through life, you don't really need 100 percent of your oxygen. Right, because you never yeah. You never get to that point. But when you do push yourself and you're like, wow, there's something wrong here. Like, I feel like really fatigued, really shitty.  Well, I mean, they must have felt because they were in the hospital. So, I mean, they were at 60 per cent oxygen in the hospital, so how are you saying they're asymptomatic? If I didn't say I never said they were asymptomatic. I said these people were in the hospital knowing something's wrong. I'm confused, OK?  Because you're saying it like these people are running around like there's nothing wrong. No, no, no, no. I'm saying the doctors are confused right now because the normal oxygen level is between 94 and 100.  There are people checking in with Corona that don't feel well, but they're at 60 percent oxygen level, which you shouldn't be able to function.  Why not? I don't know the technical, but this is what the doctors are saying where you could look it up, but you shouldn't be able to function. But they're texting. They're acting like nothing's wrong, but they're sick.  I think there's so many people are so used to feeling like shit. I don't know, something comes up, but that level is so shitty, but that level is so low. Like they said, they should be not even moving.  I was reading something about that as well, these people.  But I'm not a doctor, so I don't know how to explain it. Right. But that's what's confusing to them right now. And then you hear the kid thing. Now, kids are getting a certain form of it, like eighty five kids in New York. It's it's pretty. Five kids. Eighty five kids.  I mean, it's a small number, but what are they getting? It's attached to coronavirus. It's inflammation inside. And it's not like I said, I'm not a doctor, but I just read about it today. I think you have to keep saying I'm not a doctor.  I do, because people will take your shit so seriously. Like, well, he went through Korona. He must know everything about it. No, I know nothing.  Like they gave it a Southern accent right there. I know I did.  I do that with a lot of them are really dumb. Do you know what that came from?  Do you know what that's from? Hookworm.  Hookworm. Yeah, it's really crazy. The the stereotype of the lazy mouth breathing southerner came from massive amounts of people that were infected with parasites. And these parasites were extremely common, particularly when people walk around barefoot and they would get these worms and these worms would get into their system. And one of the side effects of these worms was a decreased brain function. So that's a that's a real stereotype that came from a real thing.  So, yeah, pull up a hookworm in the south and then stereotypes because. Yeah, I forget who told me this. Then I wound up going on a deep dive one night and just reading article upon article about this where they didn't even find out that this was a thing.  So I think it was like the 1960s. They found out about this hookworm parasite and this parasite that was extremely prevalent in the South. This thing as many of like how hookworm gave the South a bad name, hookworms once Sapt the American south of its health. Yet few realize they continue to affect millions. So this is this worm would infect people that make them a larger place. For more than three centuries, a plague of unshakable lethargy blanketed the American South.  It began with ground itch, in quotes, a prickly tingling in the tender webs between the toes, which was soon followed by a dry cough.  Weeks later, victims succumbed to an insatiable exhaustion and an impenetrable haziness of the mind that some called stupidity. Adults neglected their fields and children grew pale and listless. Victims developed grossly distended bellies and angel wings, emaciated shoulder blades accentuated by the hunching, all gazed out dully from sunken sockets with a telltale fisheye stare.  The culprit behind the germ of laziness as A.  S affliction was sometimes called was Nektar Americanus, the American murderer better known today as the hookworm. Millions of these bloodsucking parasites lived parasites lived, fed, multiplied and died within the guts of up to 40 percent of the population stretching from southeastern Texas to West Virginia. Hookworms stymie development throughout the region and bred stereotypes about lazy, moronic southerners will talk later.  News. That's that's why you do it. That's why we all do it. We do it because it was a real thing and it was a real thing because this poor people were sick with parasites. Wow, wow, wow, wow. I learned some shit today, Joe, and then another one that's not I'm from Texas. That's when you go, Oh, OK. Well, that shit that makes sense. I always used to think it was just hot there.  And it's hard to think like, you know.  Well, now, when people say you don't sound like you're from Texas, I'm like, thank you. You know, a little bit. I can hear a little bit. Yes, it is a touch. I say y'all still there's a touch to touch, you know. No, you didn't know that. There's no touch.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. You have a touch of southern some Texan in there. Just a touch. Yeah. But you definitely not from New York. No. Yeah. I mean I'm from Boston. It's like you have something, something going on there.  Boston Corona is really bad right now. Oh it was real bad. Yeah. Yeah.  It's they believe that there's a different strain on the East Coast and on the West Coast.  I agree with that 100 percent. I know I got no East Coast train. I know I did. Yeah. You get that hot train from New York. Yes, you did.  I think I think my friend sent me a picture because I didn't I didn't do any meet and greets, but I had friends come. So he sent me a picture two weeks after they know I survived or like three weeks ago. You're fine. You're feeling good. You're all good. So he sends me a picture. It's me and four of his friends. He goes, we all got it.  We must have gave it to you. We'll see you hanging around with the fucking patient zeros in New York.  Mm hmm. What were you guys doing? So you know how they come to the green room and just say, what's up, Groucho's and literally hug in.  And it was one picture and they all got it and everybody in that picture.  And so the comedian I know who you work with in Gotham, it was tone.  Bill. And did they get it? Joe No. No. Nobody I worked with in New York and flew back with. Got it.  So it was only the people that you were hanging out with in the green room because no comics were in the green room. They came back, but then there was like five people.  So they they kind of said they're all coughing and digging into your fucking craft service, literally.  I tell you, it was about it was like two minutes, but it was a bunch of hugs, kisses, like that's all it took. That's all it took, man. And he sent me the picture says now that we.  No, you well said. How those people did they survive it?  No, all of them survive. One person one girl got sick for like two weeks. But it wasn't bad.  Not like, you know, not like you had it worse than anybody. I haven't heard of any comics like that. I know. I've gotten it.  No, I haven't either. You know, I really think it had to do with you being so run down. Yeah. I mean, it's the only thing that makes sense because I know, man, me personally, I am a different human being.  When I travel too much, I just get wrecked. Yeah, you just get wrecked. Like my brain's foggy, like my kids ask me questions. One of the answers, I don't have the will to do things. I'm a different person when I travel too much.  Yeah. Yeah. Well, it's a thing where after I beat this thing, it's that road to recovery, like, you know, now it's trying to get stronger, trying to like I have my energy still, but it's just, you know, when your body's just not right.  Yeah. It's just like, oh, it's trying to catch up, you know? And I just feel like I'm that dude just trying to catch up. Are you a regular taker of vitamins?  Yes, we have.  Before this, I wouldn't say like I'm a great vitamin taker even today because I just I hear so much about I don't know if somebody said this is what you need to take, then I would take it. But I hear different things. Oh, take Catalin, take zinc. Take this. Take that.  What's Katlin is some some vitamin that my wife's father gave me.  Seidelman.  Yeah, I've heard of it katelin it's from I forgot the name of the the it's these pills are supposed to be all organic and I forgot.  Oh it's a company. No no no. Catalin is a pill from this company. I don't know what it does. He just said it's healthy just taking my wife's been taking it all our life and so I started taking it but I'm not sure it's supposed to be healthy.  I take every day I take four thousand milligrams of vitamin C, I take five thousand I use of vitamin D, I take a bunch of the shit fish oil I take to I don't fuck around, man. Yeah. Especially when when this started happening, I bore down seriously.  Like I feel like if somebody gave me this is what you need to take in a day I would take it right now. I just don't have that person to say, hey, here's the list.  Well, Dr. Rhonda Patrick will be on this week. And when she's on this week, I'm going to put something out. Oh, please. She she talks about it. I'll put it on my Instagram. No, I would love that. Because what you should do to strengthen your immune system. Do you have a sauna in your house?  No. She get a sauna?  Yeah. I used to go to a sauna place, but obviously they're close. But those are great.  If you go to one of them public ones, what kind of funk is going? I know a guy who actually thinks he got it in a sauna. He went to a sauna and he's like, that's it seems to me where I got I think there was a guy. Coffin in a sauna? Oh, well, no, these were no, but the place I went to, it's your own booth, but they clean it really good. Your own booth.  Yeah, it's these little hot boxes.  Is that an infrared one, though? Yeah. I don't know if that's really the way to go. Laird Hamilton seems to think that it isn't. And I listen to him a lot when it comes to these sort of things, because he does a lot of a lot of sonna work and breath work and things like that. And he said he developed some real skin issues from infrared sonus, the studies that were done. Is it Norway, those studies on sort of use?  Yeah, they did studies that showed a 40 percent decrease of all cause mortality for people who regularly use the sauna using the sauna four to five days a week. They showed a 40 percent. So four to five days a week, I think it was one hundred and sixty degree temperature for twenty minutes. And they showed a 40 percent decrease of all cause mortality, cancer, stroke, heart attack, everything, all all the different things because the body's production of heat shock proteins from regular sarnies.  So I have not skipped a day, not one day of sauna since this happened.  I'm very lucky to have one in my house and I have one here at the studio. So I've been doing it every fucking day and I've talked some friends into getting ones where they didn't have room for it in their house. But the Costco sells them. You can get a fucking out outdoors on a Barazani like a thousand bucks. And I think all the shit you spend money on and if you if you can afford this, please get one, because I think it's massively contributed to my health and also like alleviation of aches and pains.  I feel good. I get it every fucking day. I every day.  When I was on my routine, I loved it. Yeah, I loved it. But then everything shut down and I'm like, OK, maybe that's an investment.  Do you have room in your yard? Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Ballsiness Brown. Yeah, definitely. I'll do that. Yeah. I get in the sauna, I do twenty five minutes at 180 degrees and then I jump in the pool, do laps. That's how I end it.  So cool off. I speak about health. I after this is over I was talking to my doctor, I want to go back in you know, because we're saying it could be my immune but this has really opened my eyes. Maybe I do have something underlying, you know, it makes me want to see, OK, what could have caused it besides my immune, if there is something like this is the first time I really want to get checked out.  But have you been a guy who gets colds on a regular basis?  No, no, definitely. This is my first time in the hospital besides the concussion. Really? Yeah. So, no, I get one I get one cold a year in December, about December 14th every single year. That's just the time it comes.  So you start thinking around December 28th. Oh fuck. Here comes hundred percent.  I know it's coming. Maybe mindfuck yourself.  Maybe so. But my wife knows it's coming. She's oh it's about your time. And I guess that's like a period.  A yearly period. That's weird. Yeah.  So it's the thing where I just feel like you know, I get that one cold. But when I went to the doctor now I'm like, OK, let me investigate and get a full checkup from the dude that saved my life. Like everything. Yeah. To see if there's any underlying. Let me know.  That's the I'm very curious. I have to think it's the travel. I mean, especially listening to that schedule, flying to New York, doing all those shows, flying back. And of course, every time you fly, you're tired. You know, always you have to get up in the morning, get to fly and fly back. And the time zones all fucked up in the fact you went immediately to Vegas and drove for and backed in the same day.  Yeah.  Oh, and then this was at the time where people didn't even wear masks in the plane, you know, cause I wore one because my wife made me see.  But it didn't help.  Well it sounds like we know exactly where you got it. Yeah. It was New York. I got those guys that were you were with. Yeah I'm so I didn't have a mask when I met my four.  Maybe you gave it to them.  I don't think so. Oh, you're going to blame them. Yeah I know, I know.  I didn't have it. This is why I know I didn't have it is because the two comics didn't get it and they were with me there and then one flew back with me and the only time they weren't around me and this was the last show of the whole weekend.  So I didn't see those comics the day after. So I know I got it from them because the other comics didn't get it.  Well, my friend Sturgell got it when he was traveling in Europe and when he came home is with his wife and kids. No one got it, just him.  So, yeah, I bet you if he tested his word for it, but they all tested.  They didn't have it. At the same time, they tell everyone, does it, huh, because my wife thinks she got we got the antibody test, so we're waiting to see how she thinks she has the antibodies. Wait a minute. Why didn't anybody test what skills take like 15 minutes?  Oh, we're not Joe Rogan. We got the one where you got to go in.  It takes two days to swab the nose swab or the finger prick. No, no. They draw your blood. Oh, it's the arm. It's the FDA one, I guess. So now that's available like at some place down the street from our house.  So she went to go get it. It's just she couldn't we couldn't find time because the kids, you know, love her around.  And so when is it we get the results? Tomorrow. OK, but I took the I've taken to Corona test. I took one before I came here like three days.  I've just brushed it off. You're never going hear the end of it.  I think she did. She said, oh yeah, I had a fever for a day and the kids had one for half a day. All right. But I think I got that. I know I got that strain from New York and it hit me hard, man.  I think it's travel. I really do. I'm talking to all my comedian friends, everybody I've had here that hasn't been traveling like you. I never felt better in my life. I feel great because we're not traveling every weekend.  Yeah, I think that's it's true. I think it's like drinking every weekend.  I really think it's similar. I think it's like it's like you're beating yourself up.  And also I'm the guy that will well do the show, leave the club at one and they get on the 6:00 a.m. and that's what I did, too. Well, I did Wendy Williams.  So I flew up that night. But usually the two weeks before that I do The Late Show first flight out because I want to be with my family.  I did the exact same thing. And when I did in Florida and then literally you're laying around all day long. What the fuck did I do to myself? Right. And you feel horrible the whole day.  You can't even function exactly where I think I'm on that new pattern. When comedy picks up again, it's like, yeah, I'm a take the three or four o'clock out. I'm take my time leaving. Yeah. Because I'm worn out and you don't recover till Monday or Tuesday sometimes when you, when you do like four shows or whatever. Yeah. When you travel.  Yeah. I mean if you can get that I've vitamin drip to man that's a big one. I learned that trick from Chappelle. Oh yeah.  When I did gigs with him we would be out late and then the next day he's got a nurse that comes to the hotel.  We're all sitting around talking shit with IVs like there was a tree, like the bag was like like branches of the tree was like Donal's on one branch, I'm on another branch and we're all getting IV vitamin drips in the hotel room. Like this is so weird, but it's so effective. After you get it, you're like, fuck, I feel amazing. Is that what got you into him?  Yes. Oh wow. Yeah. And then a few of my friends get into it. They, they do vitamin drips. I've heard about it before. I never did it. Yeah I, I'm all for it. We know Jamie and I do it every week.  We do every Wednesday. We have a nurse comes in here and they give us an nad drip and an IV vitamin drip.  Well is the inside is what we talked about last time. And it is that should that lengthens your telomeres. Yeah.  How does that make you feel any different. Great. I'm one hundred percent and believe that it's made a big difference. You, you feel the same. Yeah it works. It does something. Yeah. Doctor David Sinclair had been here and from Harvard and he explained it to us what Nadie does and Amane which is a precursor to Nadeen, you could take that in pill form as well.  Now is the Nadia slow drip. Does it take longer.  Well, you, you could do it slow or you could do it fast. But if you do it fast, it's really painful. You do it fast, don't you? I do.  I do it wide open. It takes thirteen minutes. Usually supposed to take two hours. What kind of pain you're going through? It's not good. Jamie, do you go wide open? One out wide, but I've been doing it like 35, 40 minutes. It's uncomfortable.  What does it feel like? Like your guts. Your guts are on fire. It feels like you swallowed hot sauce or something like you're in agony.  Yeah, it's not doesn't feel good if you do it over a long period. It barely feel it at all the first time we did it. She goes, do you want to do it fast or slow? I go, let's do it pretty fast.  And so she did it one hour and I'm like, oh, it's kind of uncomfortable, but it's not that big a deal. It's like everything else, man.  When people are talking about the swab like, oh my God, swab is so horrible. It's so awful.  It's not it's like it's just get it in there. It's like a little weird for a second.  Not that's not that big a deal. But the Ivy Nadège it when you do it.  What I do is I have them open it wide up so the bag drains in 13 minutes and beast you just.  But it's 13 minutes versus whether you and hour of feeling like shit or 30 minutes of really feeling like shit.  I'll take the 13. OK, after the 13 minutes though, is it done like the pain just goes away. So since the drip is done. Exactly.  Exactly. The last like an extra couple of minutes and then I do the IV vitamin bag after that.  And that's nothing. That's nothing that literally there's nothing to. That's Beast. My friend was telling me about that. Yeah. Yeah. You should try it.  It feels real weird like the people that told me about it. Like it feels like your guts are on fire. I'm like, how is that possible. It is but it's an I.V. like what is it.  But it's just like you feel in your chest it feels really uncomfortable, like oh this is what it feels like.  If I could show you what you already know, you just deal with it for 13 minutes.  It just yet. Suck it up. Open it wide up. I tried. I tried it first. I go open.  I went up my feel that's like and I was like, yeah, like I think I could take this is it instant.  Like as soon as they open it up. You felt that. Oh yeah. Right away.  Because the drips going on this tour de de de de de de de de de de de de de jure it just flowing into your veins. Yeah. No, I would be there. I would be the hour, hour and a half to. I can't. I'm not. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.  When stuff goes in me. Yeah, I'm scared.  I hear David Goggins going, stay hard, motherfucker. Don't don't be a pussy. Open it up. Open it up.  I would rather go to church. I was mocked, Jamie. But Jamie goes pretty fast that now. OK, so it's my explanation of it is it's like a little exponentially. It goes up that twenty five thirty minute range sucks, but any faster than that it sucks hard. Like I start feeling at my fingers. It's a big suck. It was like it sucked.  So when you open that bitch wide and you do the 13 minute Jammey 30 minutes as fast as I can do it, I told her. And then I also put the the, the tree, the fucking pole where the IV's hanging.  I put it on a table. So more gravity. Oh great.  So it's going faster is thirteen minutes the fast. It can go fast as it can go. Yeah you're crazy but it's just, it's just pain.  I want to feel it too. I want to know what it feels like. Like. It's a miles I play a little mind game myself. Let's not it's not I mean, it's your thing.  I want to I want to have control over what what I assign to sensations.  So does it does the pain lessen every time you do it or not? No, no, no. You don't build up a time. Oh, no. I get nervous every week.  Every week. Right before I do it. I'm like, fuck, here we go. And I just kept myself in the mindset.  And then once it's happened and it's just happening, OK, did I watch Jerry Seinfeld this time that distracted the shit out of me?  Tiger King distracted the shit out of me. Did you like Tiger King? Yes, I love like I loved it.  It's amazing to me how some people just live, like, that's so disconnected.  Yeah. There's a certain special type of of person that is like really into those goddamn big cats, too.  Like, that was one thing that I got out of that. Like there's a special type of person that's into like having big cats in their backyard and shit. Have you ever messed with a cat? No, I don't feel cat that I had.  It's a little fucking baby cat scared as fuck of that thing. I told you how crazy that thing threw a blanket over it or whatever it was.  Yeah, I just I just find when you give certain people lots of land, they'll do crazy shit to it.  Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. ATV tracks and shit gun range. Yeah.  My friend has this ranch in Austin, Texas in the middle of nowhere and he always asked me to go but they got guns, they, they blow up cars, they use dynamite sounds very Texan.  So Texas they ride horses and I'm like no, because I can't see myself and I'm a warrior. I can see myself going there and getting shot on accident like there that they drink, they shoot guns, they drink and then shoot them blowing up cars when they're drunk, like that's them.  He has a lot of money. So he'll die.  He just gets used cars, puts them out and feel bad if he dies that way. Hey, he's a good friend. Well, and he parties hard. If you drink and shoot guns and something goes wrong, people like, well, what do you think it was going to happen?  Yeah, here's a helicopter. So helicopters, this is what I do for a living. I don't want to say. You don't want to say. Well, well, now he's an oil business.  Oh, there you go, Texas. So, like, I just see them in a copter drinking like this is on. He sends me the video and then shooting a car, it blows up from a helicopter.  Texas is a special place. That's real freedom. They don't give a fuck down there.  No, they don't like Austin, Texas. We're my friend Adam lives Adam Curry. He's already eaten at restaurants. He sent me this is like before I went to Florida, he sent me a message and he went to a restaurant. They didn't wear a mask. But eating normal, like, isn't it crazy how quickly that went away? Oh, yeah.  Well, I think I think people now are just accepting people are going to die. Like if the president just came out and say, look, a lot of people are going to die, but that's for to us to get back, we need to go out. So it's almost like herd immunity.  But if you say something like that, people are going to go crazy, like how close are you to say it? You can't say it that way.  They won't go crazy. You know why? Because right now in America, it's so divided where no matter what Trump says, liberals are going to go nuts. His base, fine with it, you know, so it's going to be the same.  We would think people like you say that. But if someone in your family does something and then goes out and dies because.  But that's happening now. That's happening now. What do you mean?  People are going out with no mask and they catch us stuff and then 80000 people are dead. So that's some of these families those people are in.  But I want to know and he said people that are dying, what are the extenuating circumstances? How many of them are old? So I read something. I need to know if this is true. Someone said that the Google this the average age of people who have died from the coronavirus is older than the average age that people die. Hmmm, I haven't heard that, yeah, but I've read that I've heard 60 and up I was on the way out the door was like, God, I've got to remember to look at the I heard I've read stuff.  Like I said, there's so many different stories out there. But I've heard that Korona are killing people a decade before they're supposed to die.  Yeah. When you say that, though, that's when you're that old. Anything can kill you. Absolutely right. When you're 75 years old and you get the flu, you have a very high likelihood you're going to die. It's much higher than if you're 35 years old.  You get the flu. That's like with everything you know.  So what are we going to do in the flu comes around?  Are we going to change our behavior or are we going to isolate and social distance each other when the flu is?  But the difference with the flu, you have a vaccine. You sometimes have sometimes been, yeah, but at least there's comfort. Yes, to something to the flu shot. Exactly. Yeah. But what KORONA You don't have that yet. So and the problem is it just started, you know, so you have no answers. And literally a new strain could come out. They don't even know if it mutates yet. You know, they saying it doesn't.  Well, they think it does. It does.  They think that in India they have a completely different strain that will if they come up with a vaccine for the coronavirus that we have here, it won't be effective on the coronavirus that they have in India.  See, I mean, so, like, there's so many things that it's just not known. And that's what makes it scary to people. And that's why I so miss.  So was this I hear this table from the CDC is updated as like us last week.  OK, well, this is not what I'm looking for. Me to two broad ones written that article. I don't know how to find it, though. Yeah. No one wrote that article. I mean, I can't find like, that specific question.  Did you ask it that way? The average age of people dying from coronavirus is older than the average age that people die. And I think that and this is the article that comes up.  So it says 85 years, thirteen thousand, 75 to 80 for twelve thousand sixty five to 74.  Nine thousand. You know, the covered in this column. So the average age people die is somewhere in the range of seventy five, seventy eight point five. And I typed it in.  So seventy eight point five four is when people die. So 75 to 84 years old would be the average age people die. And that's 12000 people. Over 85 is 13000 people. So that's the vast majority of people. The larger number of people is the 75 to 80 to 85 year old, 85 plus year old. So that that does make sense. That is correct. Then. Wow, I keep staring at that 45 to 54 number said it could have been two two six three.  Oh no. Yeah, it's it's relatively small. Yeah. The younger people. And then when you get to 15 to 24, there's only 48 deaths, five to 14, four deaths, one to four, two deaths under four under one four deaths. So, yeah. So, I mean, it's not good when anybody does any disease, but this is it is interesting and it points to the immune system, it points to whether or not your immune system can fight it off.  Yeah, let me tell you, I'm saying like, I'm doing the Dripps. I'm a get a drip later this week. I had one a couple of weeks ago because I've always been in the trenches.  Eat. Do you eat well? He helped me anymore. Yeah. What do you eat? Well, I wake up, eat oatmeal in the morning. Not really that good. Avocado avocado is pretty good for those just carbs.  OK, and then I'm just telling what I eat and then for lunch I eat the same thing every day I have a turkey bowl. It's just turkey rice and beans. And then for dinner I'll have a salad flavor.  Yeah. I'm not, I'm not a foodie really at all. Like I don't like. Yeah, I'm like a robot. I could eat the same thing every single day. I do eat the same thing every single day. Really. Yeah. Maybe that's your problem.  Eating the same thing. Boring ass bullshit food. And then I eat a salad at night with like fish or chicken or something like that.  Boring. I am boring. I am. But my, my, my wife is like you order a pizza then I was like I'll yeah. I'll switch it up when she wants to eat.  But as far as me but like in college I did that, you know, like you wake up in the morning when you play college football, you eat this afternoon, you eat this like I was on creatine, like we were a test school for creatine.  So they gave us that six times a day. But you had to stay on a certain diet, a game like almost sixty pounds like a year. Creatine put some weight on.  You made that face fat. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, Samoan. Yeah.  In Samoa we retain so much water. That's the interesting thing about when I did the Carnivore diet, I did the Carnivore diet. I wound up losing I think somewhere around thirteen pounds in a month.  And I got ripped, I got really shredded. But also your muscles get smaller, like everything got smaller, my face got smaller, everything got smaller because your body's retaining less water because you don't have glucose in your system, you don't have as much glycogen. It's different. You're not eating carbohydrate. I wasn't any carbohydrates.  OK, so since I'm serving with oatmeal, what should I be starting with? I mean, there's nothing wrong with oatmeal.  I mean, oatmeal's fine. You just sit on my oatmeal. He's done a lot of nutrients in it. It's OK. It's OK. It's it's good carbohydrates. Yeah.  Oatmeal with blueberries is a good way to get started. When do you like to work out. Do you work out in the morning. Soon as I wake up. Soon as you wake up I drink first and then workout.  No I drink three cups of water workout. I mean three cups of water. Then I have a little shake with that layered stuff, the superfood. So I have that and then I work out.  Well that's good.  Yeah. That's not bad. Yeah. I mean it's a little something, something I've done both. I do fasted exercise so I'll not eat for six hours and then I get up in the morning and I'll either run or I'll do yoga or on a crazy day I'll do both. I'll run with the dog for an hour and then I'll go and do a yoga class for an hour and a half. No food, but I'm pretty wrecked by the time the fuss is over.  Yeah, I sometimes do the fasting too and I'll run and then I'll go work and I feel great.  But if you get through it you feel so good luck and you feel like you did something. Yeah. You did something.  You really did some struggle. The struggles real. What I like is fruit. Before I workout it seems like that's the like today I had some bananas and then I did some kickboxing. I feel like there's something about fruit where it's not heavy. It's not going to fuck with my like if I'm working out really hard and I'm digesting food, it feels like shit feels terrible. But for me, oranges, apples, fruit, some blueberries, that's nice.  It gives me just a little bit of sugar a little bit just to get me going. I'll drink some coffee and then I can get a good workout in and it's just enough fuel to power me through a workout. I've tried both ways. I definitely can work out harder when I have some fuel.  I was watching TV. This happened a couple of weeks ago and I started laughing because all that popped into my head was you when they released the footage of those UFOs.  I know Joe Rogan is going to talk about this the next step.  Oh, I'm so happy. I love it. But wasn't that release like a year ago? Well, it was leaked.  It was when the Pentagon finally looked in the middle of the pandemic.  What a great time to just admit the UFO, because one of the things that I said on my Instagram, I was like in any other time in history, if the government came out and said there are flying saucers that defy our understanding of propulsion and physics, the world will go crazy. But in 2020, people look like nothing. Has anybody seen those pilots? Well, I've had one of them on here.  Oh, so he doesn't believe it. Yeah.  Doctor Commander David Fraser. I had him on the podcast and he was explaining the whole. To me, like his experience off the coast of San Diego, running into one of these things, I mean, there's people that are debunkers, but they need to understand this is not just visual. They they had very specific, like actual real data, including radar. They track these things. They use sophisticated military tracking. These are real objects. This is not like there's a lot of dummies out there on debunk everything.  And they're just as much of a religious person as someone who who's a true believer. They're a true believer that everything can be explained.  Well, not everything can be explained. And these things can't be explained when when they're explaining how these things traveled at these, like they went from like six feet off the ground to 60000 feet in a matter of a couple of seconds.  They fly in some way that these military aircraft pilots can't explain.  They don't understand it and they don't know what they are now, whether they're from another planet that's never been proven. They might be interdimensional, they might be something from here. They might be some super sophisticated top of the food chain, top secret stuff that they're exposing these people to just so they freak out and like, let's let's see if they can get a you know, get an explanation for this. Let's let's launch these things and have them fly past people at these preposterous rates of speed and see what the reaction is.  Do you think those those type of secrets, if there are or higher than the president, do you really do you think there's an organization that's above president?  100 percent, 100 percent. Here's what presidents come and go. Every four years, we're going to trust some dipshit who wins a popularity contest. Trump is a perfect example of that.  Here's a guy who's not even a politician, lifelong businessman who wins a popularity contest, gets to be in the most powerful office. Most powerful position, really, the world's ever known president of the United States, commander in chief of the greatest army this entire planet has ever seen. You're going to tell him. You tell Trump. I mean, think think. Oh, he believes Obama's from Kenya.  He believes a lot of people believe that.  But, you know, look, you see those birth certificates? It's like, yeah, well, is this real?  And by the way, Obama's when he was in college, his publicist for his whatever book he was publishing or whatever, forget what it was, but wrote down as in his bio, born in Kenya.  So it wasn't just a couple of people. It was literally somebody was working with Obama wrote down that he was born in Kenya. Does that mean he was born in Kenya? No, it doesn't. It might mean that the publicist thought it would be cool to say he was born in Kenya because it make wow, this guy's gone so far.  And look at him now. He's at Harvard. He was born in Kenya. It's makes for a better story. It makes for a better story. Yeah.  So you have to take all the possibilities into consideration, you know.  But anyway, Trump was a he was that was his thing. He was a birther. Right. So he believes a lot of wacky shit.  And and if you gave him access to that, he would have definitely told us stuff by now.  Of course, since you have I mean, Carter said that he would he said that he'd actually seen a UFO and that if he got into the office, he would tell everybody and he got into office and then agent. Didn't say shit, I really thing when people go in there, man. I think if you're a president, they say this is what we can keep you alive on. If you talk about this, we can't we can't protect you.  I honestly think they have that conversation.  Well, if you look at what Obama said before he got into office versus what he did when he got in office is two possible scenarios.  One, he got in office and then he got compromised and he became corrupt.  And it became a part of the system to his understanding when he was running for president of what the how the world really works is vastly different than how the world actually works.  And then once you get in there, you realize that the huge spectrum of threats to the United States and to people that are coming from all around the world all the time and what needs to be done to mitigate these threats? I'm more inclined to believe the latter.  I think it's more like that.  I think I think you have these idealistic perspectives that once you get into office, they get sort of dashed and you go, holy shit, you're like, oh, everybody wants that's why they all look old to I think the pressure that they like.  What the fuck?  I think the whole world is barely keeping it together every day, every day of the year, barely keeping it together.  You got like this fucking Libya's a failed state and they're having slave auctions on YouTube. And you've got ISIS is plotting these fucking these attacks here and this group. And Boko Haram is doing this and fucking al-Qaida is doing that. And the Taliban and all day China is doing this and North Korea has got that.  And I think every fucking president deals with a new series of potential terrorist attacks, a new series of religious fanatics that want to blow things up and kill people. And you've got white nationalist that are going to Christchurch, New Zealand, shooting people at a mosque. It's like all day long you've got madness.  And if you're the one person that won the popularity contest and all sudden you're sitting in the fucking control room and they're explaining everything to you, like The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer.  Come on, man.  Breaking news every time they come on. Breaking news. Breaking news.  It's madness. It's madness. That's what I think. I think all day long. It's madness.  Yeah, it's it's scary, man. It's scary.  I think they keep Trump in the dark. They feed him at all and let them watch Keeping Up with the Kardashians.  And this is like these just tweets about people he's mad at how. I'm Don Lemon, you piece of shit. And he gets mad at people. I mean, how crazy is is that our president just tweets all this. All, I think over the weekend. One hundred and twenty six times or retweeted, bro, I don't even have time to tweet.  You know, if it's so rare that I tweet something. Most of my tweets come from Instagram. Post a picture on Instagram and that gets tweeted.  That's that's most of the time. If I tweet once in a day, it's a lot. That's a crazy day.  I wonder if somebody wrote. Do you think somebody runs his account and you think it's actually him?  Yes, I do. Yes, I do. Yes, I do. I don't see positive because I'm not positive. But I really believe that because I think that if you look at his pattern before he was ever president, that's how he did.  So he always used to always just talk shit. It's the way he gets the word out.  And it's, you know, it's real controversial, man. I mean, because some of the things that he says, like he's threatening people, like he's he's threatening North Korea with with missiles and shit.  Did you think the dictator was that when they came out of Japan? I was hoping he's dead because I wanted to see what happens if his sister takes over.  That'll be fun.  She has my name. Yo, that was pretty cool because I am Korean. It's also yo, we got a yo in the house, got a yo in the house.  Yeah I was, I was thinking, but apparently Jamie said that the story is that he faked his own death so that he could find out who the traders were.  Good plan. Makes sense, makes sense to me. Yeah, if you look at them like he says, heart attack, like, OK, look at them.  Yeah, I mean, it looks like he's ready for a heart attack.  Well, then that must also mean he's threatened in some way. To where? Oh, yes, there's some.  Listen, when you're a fucking dictator. Yeah. Every day is like think of the horrible shit he's done.  He killed his own uncle right in his own uncle. Killed and his brother. Yeah. And his brother and the uncle's brother. Right. Or his brother know his belief.  You got to that's the airport one where he killed his brother in an airport. He had a mom to give him some poison or something. Allegedly. Yeah. I don't know about that. But didn't he.  He killed someone with a missile. Oh yeah.  Blew him up. Yeah. I think it was his uncle. Yeah. He shot his uncle with a missile, as anyone knows, do do a poll and then fucking hid behind a rock.  That's fucking crazy.  Like, like anyone I guess that could take power or in the realm of taking power. He got rid of them. Yeah. They said that. I can't, I don't know their numbers, but let's say 13 people or like his father screw like only two of them survive the rest. The other eleven, like disappeared.  Well, you got to think once he assumes power and people realize, like, this guy is just born into power and was probably a lot of people plotting against him on military people plot against him.  And that's a dark country where they all plot against each other and they all rat on each other. It's built into the system. You know, they're all supposed to tattletale on each other.  I just feel like, you know, this dude came in like a football coach was like, I'm firing everybody. I have my own team firing people who just killed him.  I think that's what they do over there, man. I don't know.  But my mom, she's from South Korea. She's like she's always asked, oh, is North Korea ever going to do something? South Korea? She's like, nah, like people from there seems no threat.  That's what's crazy. It's a sad country. Yeah, sad.  And a lot of the reason why it's the way it is is the United States is interference.  You know, I mean, if you look at the history of North Korea, like how it got started and why they became this horrific military or military dictatorship, you can kind of trace a good chunk of it to American policy. And what we did in Korea during the Korean War, it's fucking crazy shit. Yeah.  It's this world. It's just nuts. Like, I don't know if you saw the video of that kid that was jogging, Ammad. Yes. I mean, what is going on? Like, I'm not surprised. I can say I'm not surprised.  Like something more graphic. Seriously, the guy in the back of the pickup truck with a shotgun, the other guy jumps out and he's trying to grab the shotgun from him. They shoot him.  Like what my thing is, how do we have laws that say that you could chase somebody with guns? And here's the thing. If you notice in the video, the truck is in front of them. So they chased them, got in front of them. The guy that's running behind them, it's almost like like a man was trapped, a guy chasing you with a camera. The truck was already pulled up. So it was certainly trapped.  I mean, they chased him down and it's vigilantism even. Look, even if he did something, I me I don't even know if he did anything. No, he said he was just running. But there's actually a photograph.  There's videos of him walking into a house being built like it's just wood inside. Right. He looked at it. Well, I told my wife I would do that shit when I was a kid. Me too.  I was telling my wife we just did that the other day. They're building a house and we just, oh, let's see where this is. And then he jogs on well, didn't steal anything, didn't have anything, just jogging. Now, how do we come to a point in our country where two men can chase him down with guns and then get in a fight with them and then say it was self-defense?  Well, I think Georgia has some crazy laws, citizens or citizens arrest. And also they have ties to law enforcement.  Yes, the father was with the DEA and then the prosecutor, the local prosecutor wrote this letter that said basically he burglarized the kid, Imod, burglarized something which he didn't, and they had every right to pull them over. And when he didn't stop, they got in a fight. And so they had every right to kill him.  So now the way the government came in, like the big dogs came in and then they arrested two people in two days. And it was just like, uh, we don't think so.  And here's a think social media outlet did it did took the outrage of people finding out about the case.  But when I found out that it happened months ago oh, two twenty three, February twenty, I mean, February, 23 months, these guys were out and they knew that they had shot him.  And then here's what's really crazy.  Had the video. Here's it's really crazy. The video was released by their own lawyer.  You know why? Because they thought it showed that the guy tried to take the gun away.  Look, this is going to free you when I'm doing the Southern accent.  I've got an idea. We'll release the video and then everyone's going to know that dude release the video and this is what I heard he released that had helped helped him because the guy didn't stop when they tried to pull him over.  Fuck.  Imagine being a 25 year old black man and two white guys in the back of a pickup truck with shotguns. Pull over. There's no one else around. Holy.  What was the kid's supposed to do? Just stop and talk to two men with guns? Exactly. It's it's. And then and then I was listening to reports like before this video even came out. Here's what's crazy is the police had the video at the beginning and they still dismissed it. They had this at the beginning. They didn't release it. The lawyer released it, like you said.  So they had it at the beginning, Frazey, that the lawyer thought that that was going to help his clients.  You know what I think and I don't know much about the person that shot it, but if I'm guessing everybody starting out, I think he shot the video. Whoever this guy was, it's almost like a hero video. Look at this. We caught a guy that burglarized like they felt like this and then the gun start going off.  Yeah. Holy fuck. Yeah, maybe.  And then the vigilantism is scary, man, because people just decide that they're right and they decide that this is this is the person. And no due process, no trying on your part with shotguns drawn like cops don't even do that, man.  They turn the lights on first. They pull you over, they start talking to you. Don't pull the gun out right away when you just jogging.  Well, some cops do. I mean, it's happened before. A lot of video of that to video that, too. So but I do think I mean, it's Deep South. I mean, territory hookworm.  It's it's it's racism. I think racism led it to, you know.  Well, it's very likely. Yeah. It's the very least.  It has to be considered as one of the main components of this sort of interaction.  So I just feel that, you know, any time you bring up race, you'll have the audience that goes, oh, you got to bring up race. But this was a black guy that got shot by two white guys with shotguns. Let's take away race. Let's say the two guys shot a white guy that was jogging. It's still wrong.  Yeah, it's wrong.  It's still even if you take the potential racism out, take it out. You got a 25 year old just kid is out jogging. These guys pull up with shotguns and tell them to, you know, hey, we want to talk to you like, fuck.  Well, you've heard this. Some people don't even think racism is real, like, oh, there's no racism in America. This is, I mean, racist people.  But anybody who doesn't believe that, it's like saying sexism isn't real, but they don't think it's big, is it? It is.  You know, like you said something at the Comedy Store and it may have been in one of your specials where you were talking about something and you said that's only four people go, yeah, the United States, 1776.  Yeah, that's only four people go, three people go, three people died.  So if you think about that, right, three people go, people own people, own people. So you were racist and then your kids were racist? Yeah, my dad is that third level being black had to go through racism. So we're still in it. It can't go away that fast.  It takes a long time to go away when you get the roots of it. That's still deeply embedded in these cities. Right.  Like places like Baltimore. You're just red lines where you weren't even allowed to sell a home to someone who was black in certain districts was illegal.  I mean, my dad has a nuclear physics and went to a college where he couldn't even eat at restaurants on campus.  And where was that? You went to Oklahoma State.  You couldn't even eat at certain restaurants on campus.  What year was this? Well, he's seventy five. So sixties.  So during the civil rights, all the riots and he led my dad was in marches to try to get the local restaurant to let him in.  So it's a thing where when people go, racism isn't that bad. My dad is only seventy five. Right, right. Right. And he went through it during his life.  During his lifetime right now. So and this is when and this is when my dad was telling me when he was growing up, this is how my dad said he didn't even know he was poor growing up because they never left the area. They couldn't go anywhere.  Why? He never knew they were poor. He never saw white people because they weren't allowed to go anywhere anyway. So he never knew they were in poverty. You know, I was reading this horrible story about even after slavery was abolished, one of the things that they would do was they would capture black men for loitering and force them into going into labor camps so they would literally enforce slavery but do slavery by having them in prison and forcing them to do labor.  Now, the reason why I bring this up right now, there was a garbage strike, garbage workers strike. And so they brought in prisoners. They kicked. Find out where this is.  They this is I don't remember where it was, but I was reading and I was like, what in the fuck? So these guys, the garbage men made ten dollars an hour. They fired all the striking garbage men and brought in prisoners to do this.  Here it is. Prison labor replaces striking garbage workers in New Orleans. Stop and think about that. They said, you know what? You want more than ten dollars an hour. I got a better idea. We'll get people to do it for free. So they're essentially reigniting slavery in New Orleans when it comes to taking care of garbage.  Yeah, I mean, it's still around, but the fact that they think that's OK, that this is like, well, I got a solution.  Yeah. In the fact you don't think someone should get more than ten dollars an hour to fucking take care of people's garbage, that's it's insane.  It's insane. And bringing in literally slaves. Yeah. Well, they shouldn't have done that. They would be paid only 13 percent of what garbage makers.  So the garbage workers who are only making ten dollars and 25 cents an hour. So they're going to get 13 percent of that, which is what is that?  Is that I got back 50 cents lower and that it's like 75 cents. Right. It's about a dollar.  Probably a dollar fuck.  Maybe a dollar, 30 fuck. I mean, that's just modern day slavery. It is slavery. Yeah, I mean, given them a dollar. That's insane, but some people would say, you know, they're inmates, they did wrong. That's right. Hold on, but we'll go scroll back up there. Listen to this. Metro services group has a lot has long been an advocate of helping persons who had been incarcerated, returned to society in a meaningful and productive way, said the city sanitation services in a statement.  Metro makes no apologies for this policy as a core element of our commitment to being good corporate citizens. Under state rules, prison inmates employed by Metro services paid only 13 percent of what garbage workers make.  Fuck. What's a corporate citizen? What does that mean? No idea.  But that is that that is so. That is so. It's weird because there's no end of the quotation marks that this actually did it go through.  How long is it happening? Oh, fuck. This is happening. Despite the use of inmates, garbage workers say they will continue to strike in New Orleans. They have built widespread community. They've built widespread community spreads from unions and community groups. But still, that doesn't make any sense.  They have built widespread community spreads from unions and communities, but with a weird sentence from unions and community groups. But still, the city has refused to meet them and discuss their safety concerns.  So they have a lot of support from unions in the community, but they won't meet with them still. Oh, I see. They've built widespread community. I think they want to say they have built widespread community support, support from unions and community groups.  Yeah, they wrote spreads instead of support, I think, and said there they aren't trying to hear us, says Woods. They don't care about us.  They would let anything happen. Oh, this is awful. See, I mean, if they were sick, we don't care.  They don't care if we spread the disease. They just don't care. Yeah, I mean, just a human being. Making ten dollars an hour to do a full time job is fucking insane. It's insane. And a grown man in a union that can't get more than ten dollars an hour.  How fucking crazy is this is this is what we're living in. And I often wonder, you know, I always think about your three people go and I go, how long is it going to take?  How many people from us? Right. Is it going to take you know, I'm like maybe five, maybe six if the world is still around. Well, because there will always be racism, some racism.  Not necessarily always. Because we could get to a point where we're indistinguishable, right?  Yes. I get you know, they'll find another they'll find something else going to be classism, classism, or it'll be it'll be a financial thing or an intelligence thing, you know, unless unless they get to genetic engineering, unless genetic engineering reaches a point where literally there is no disparity in human beings in terms of intelligence looks, all those things.  But what is that going to be like? Yeah, there's always going to be competition. There's always going to be weirdness. Right. There's always you know, there's always going to be those women that can bounce back from pregnancy quicker. There's always going to be men like, you know, super geniuses. We're knuckleheads like us are scratching our heads. The fact that they even think of that, I always think that every time I talked to Elon, every time I have that dude in here, my life isn't fair.  How fair? I'm so much dumber than him and sit down to talk to him. It's like him talking to a chimp, like, you know, it's like he's talking to a toddler, but you can lift more weights.  Oh, fuck him up. If we had a fight, Dad, I'm the one who's going to walk out of the room, like, there you go.  Sorry I had to kill him, but he's he's so much smarter than me. Look, it's not even close. He's a large man who is bigger than me, too. He's the world's not fair. Right. And unless we figure out a way to make it fair, which is almost impossible, it's going to be prejudice. There's going to be disparity. There's going to be some people.  Look, one thing that I talked to him about, Ellen, I thought was really interesting. He's got this new thing that he's working on called neural link. And this neural link is going to rapidly increase our ability to access information. And he literally said we're going to be able to communicate without talking. And I had talked about this on the podcast before, that we're going to be able to read each other's minds. And I've said this like, what do we all want that stoned as a joke?  It's not a matter what we want to thank the chimps.  We're like, do you know, one day we're going to have cars that pollute the Earth?  The chimps like, do we want that? Like, they didn't sit around, think that do I get a gun? Fuck, yeah. I'm going to go to the fucking Michigan capital and with my gun. Yeah, yeah.  You know, I mean, this is just what happens, whether or not we want that. This is what happens.  And what he's saying is essentially that one day with this neural link, you're going to have incredibly boosted powers of of of cognition.  You're going to be a different thing than you are now. So my take on it was, OK, well, what would be the debt? Because, well, you'd have so much more access to resources, you would be able to get so much more done. You'd be so much more productive, productive. So what I was saying is, but what about the people who can't afford this? The people that can afford it would get so far ahead that the people, you know, like before cell phones were around.  Remember? Do you remember the movie Wall Street? Yeah, of course. Right. You remember Michael Douglas walking around with that stupid book?  He was walking around that big old brick like and we're like, God, this guy's a baller. He's on the beach and he's still talking. Now, everybody can do that. Yeah, right.  But there was a long period of time, you know, years where only wealthy people had cell phones all the time. Now everyone does.  But if neural happens and some wealthy people have this insane access to resources and this insane bandwidth and its ability to communicate without words long before people like you or I get it, if those billionaires get it first, they're going to be able to they'll be so far ahead of us.  Who says they have to share it? Right. And then forget about us.  What about really poor people? They're going to be fucked. They're going to be like these goddamn garbage workers scratching, trying to get more than ten dollars an hour.  And people are fuck you will will use slaves, literal slaves. Well, then that goes to your racism thing. It becomes the classism thing. Yes, it becomes a class, so there's always going to be something. Yeah, you know what I mean?  But to me, when hate is involved with it, you know, I think that's where we should draw the line. But that's that's more of where I'm going is like how many people from us like where it's just you don't just kill random people jogging down the street.  You know, it's hard it's it's hard to imagine that that still goes on today. Right. But then when you hear about your dad and that your dad went to college in a place where he couldn't eat the same places as white people, you like white on campus, on campus, on campus in his lifetime.  It's changing.  It's getting better that that doesn't exist today. And this is what I don't like.  And some black people I don't want to say just black, but some black people, when they go, oh, you know, my dad, his is and he always gets mad about it. He goes, when when some black people go, it's no better than it was way back in the day. But I go, excuse me, you're twenty five years old saying that I went through the shit. Right. It is a lot better. A lot better.  I'm in my house. I can go to any restaurant I want.  You know, that interracial relationship doesn't mean anything anymore. No, I mean to most people.  To most people, most people don't care at all. And that's the whole thing, is that my dad is like some black people discredit the whole journey because they try to just say, ah, it's just like it was before. No, no, no.  You read any of Steven Pinker's work. Steven Pinker is really, really brilliant guy. And one of the things that he gets criticized for is showing how much less violent the world is today, how much less crime there is, how much less rape, how much less murder. This is essentially the safest place, the safest time ever in human history.  And and people like your discrediting all of the horrors that happened. He's like, no, not no, not I'm not I'm not dismissing all the terrible things that happen in the world. But we're saying even though those things do exist, they exist in a far less frequent, far, far less frequently than did 100 years ago, 200 years ago. Any time throughout human history, there's a trend. And that trend is a society is getting safer and people are getting nicer and people are getting they're getting better.  We're growing and learning. Well, I also think now, like I'm from my family, my dad's side, I'm the first person that dealt with like I would say, I deal with racism, but not on the scale my dad dealt with it not and my dad didn't deal with it on the scale. His father, my grandfather dealt with it. So it's kind of like and I'm teaching my kids not to be that way. So I feel like these kids that are young growing up, they're going to be so much more sensitive towards other people.  Yeah. Than we were for sure, because we were still I wouldn't say like in in it, but we were in it like in my household, you know what I mean? Like my dad, you know, would tell me stories of what happened to him. And I was like, wow, you went through that. But I went to a school in Houston, Texas, where I stood out. My parents were the only mixed couple. I was the only mixed kid at our school, I believe, because I didn't it wasn't even a thing, you know, like people go, you look different, you know, like what I like.  Kids would come up to me and go, What are you? And then I was like, man, what am I?  My dad was like telling you black and Asian, you know? So it's it's what I was.  But nobody on my block we're interracial is either black couples or white couples. And my parents were like like before the trend, you know. And it's a thing where I saw what happened to my mom didn't teach me to be my mom didn't teach me anything about my Korean heritage because people made fun of her accent.  So she didn't want me to go through that. So she tried to Americanize me as fast as possible.  You know, my dad, he's that I don't give a shit guy, you know, he's like there's ignorant people. I don't care. They can say what they want, you know, his favorite word is the N-word, you know what I mean? So he loves to watch movies. My dad is so crazy. He loves to watch movies with the N-word in it because he says that's real.  That's how it really was. I think that Leonardo DiCaprio movie with Samuel L. Jackson. Oh, the band of eight or something like that.  It was called Hateful. Yeah. Favorite movie. He goes because that's how you use the N-word, like they said it, that normally, like he loves the realness of that, you know, he's just crazy. Like he's 75.  He's gone through some shit. Yeah. It's a different world, different world that he went through. This is one thing that I when, you know, people complain about social justice warriors and the ridiculous calling out of everything being racist and everything being sexist.  And I, I agree.  But the fact that that is the trend that a lot of these young people are going in, there's it's too far in a lot of ways, but it'll all balance out like you got to have that sort of overwhelming left leaning.  Ideology, and then it's overwhelming right leaning ideology for people to say what is rational, yeah, what's rational, but the trend seems to be.  In a positive way, it seems to all be going in a positive way, like it seems to be like racism is way less tolerated amongst most of the people that are in the middle. Most the people that aren't crazy and aren't aren't, you know, aren't overly sensitive. Like it seems like things are balancing out. Yeah, it's the problem is the older people.  Yeah. That's where Corona Corona is doing it. But not because your mom just shook it off. Oh my God. Talking shit like literally talking like you don't understand the conversation. I wish I was there. Oh my God. Hilarious. Oh, man. She taught my dad didn't get it. No, it's interesting. And you get an antibody test now.  My dad my dad only been to the doctor once. My dad went to the doctor three years ago.  I was having my son, my wife, and I said, Dad, I want you around for my son. You need to go to the doctor and get a checkup, because every time I go to a doctor, all my friends go to if you go to a doctor, you die like he feels. If you see a doctor, you're going to die. She's crying, you know? So it's like I'm seventy two at that time. I'm fine.  I'm not going to. But he decides to go because I beg him to my mom's breast cancer twice throat cancer, all types of cancers. My mom goes calls me after his checkup, after she goes, nothing's wrong with him.  Like she was mad about it.  She was so mad. How did your mom get throat cancer?  Well, she had breast cancer. And they you know, they do the scan and they found like the second time I remember we having this big thing because she beat it once I was younger and I really understand it. You know, I was like nine. So you don't grasp it. But at thirty one really hurt me and she's really into Jesus.  And I go, wow, that's messed up. You're kind of Koreans.  Very, very Christian. I mean she's super religious.  So I said, Mom, how at that time I was a different person. I was like your God, you know, gave you breast cancer again. How's that good.  And she goes, Well, if I hadn't got breast cancer, I would have known I had throat cancer, you know? So she found the positive of it. Well, yeah. So that's the only reason she knew she had to be like. But women. God gave you two.  Yeah. The fuck. She was in a hospital. I don't want to argue with her. I get it. I get it.  But it's a thing where my mom Karlovy. Was so funny because she was so mad that my dad didn't have something that's so funny.  She was so she was so angry and he's only been in like I'm forty five now in my forty five years.  That's the first time he's gone to the doctor.  And is your dad active. Does he. He wants to two hours every day. Oh that's great.  On his treadmill and he watches all these Netflix shows. Oh that's great. Yeah. That's a great way to do it too. Yeah. Because you know you're on a treadmill, you don't even notice what's going on.  You know, like if you're watching something, if you're watching something entertaining, like I was saying I was watching Tiger King was yesterday, Drew, you know, you know, you know, as long as you're watching something, I learned that when Ari and Tom and Bert and I did that sober October. Yeah. Like you could get so much more cardio done while you watched the movie. Absolutely. You don't even notice.  So my dad walks at to, you know, the speed to and he works for two hours and watch the shows. So six months ago, my mom calls me.  Your dad flew off the treadmill, so he walks in his underwear. I'm finding all this up once he walks in his underwear and he accidently wasn't paying attention and he hit the one before the two, it went well.  Oh, no, it's so fat. So he's off and he flew. Oh, my God.  Whole leg was just shredded like like scars and everything. God. Oh, my gosh. So you know me. I started sending him images of people flying.  Oh, but he's back on it. I was like, Dad, you need to get a step or something like, no, I'm a walk. So he's back on it though. He's he's crazy.  Like, my dad is a no shit type of guy. It is what it is. And he's that do like when I die, you know, I don't care where you put me. You should get your dad on a podcast.  Oh, I'm a get my parents on mine. Yeah. Has your dad been on before? Not.  Yeah, but they talk so much shit each other like it's amazing. Like, like oh my Instagram. Those videos of them like they're in an argument.  My dad is telling my mom that's Korean and Asian people don't know how to drive and they're just arguing about it on Instagram.  Oh yeah. You're Instagram. You have that up there. It's somewhere on there. It's probably deeper. Tell people to find it. But yeah, it's on there.  But but my mom is like, yeah, Asian people can't drive, but Korean people can go.  He's like, that's the same damn thing, you know. So that's ever since I was growing up.  That's the relationship that's so far. So they've always been one of ours.  They're one of those that's so fun. It's so funny that she was mad that she didn't have anything wrong with it. Oh, angry the way she said it. Just the way she said it. She goes, hey, so we got results. You're. Dad not sick at all. He had nothing wrong with him. I'm like, Mom, you should be happy about this mom.  They're crazy. Some they're they're crazy.  They're crazy. But the world is crazy right now.  But I you know, I just I just hope it gets better. I just hope we can get. I don't wanna sound like Rodney King.  It's going to take some time. That's going to take longer than everybody thinks. I think everybody thinks it's going to all clean up real quick, and I don't think so. I think we're in this for a couple of years.  The chronic. Yeah, that's what I think. Yeah, 100 percent black. But my thing about opening up the country is it's it's not about you opening up the country. I just don't feel in a lot of places people are comfortable even going out. Like I wouldn't go to a restaurant in L.A. right now. I would. Yeah, yeah.  I think people are going to get used to it. I think people need to for sure, need to take care of their immune system is very important.  And and people need to educate themselves and they need to understand the value of your health, because for the longest time when we didn't have something like this, there's a lot of people that are like barely hanging on healthwise and any little thing can set them off.  But but when I say go to a restaurant, I got to go with a five month eight year old and a three year old son. I'm like, that's that's what that's what I'm talking. I'm not talking about me. Yeah. I'm not talking about the whole family.  Yeah, but yeah, I'm not no way would I take a five month old.  I think you're your real concern for sure is people that have issues. That's the real concern. And the real concern is coming home like, you know, your mom shook it off.  But some moms not you know, some some older folks are not going to you know, we've got to do our best to shield them and hopefully the REM's disappear. How do you say that shit? Yeah, they're testing it right now. Yeah.  Apparently that is really helping. And it's people who are recovering 31 percent faster, but it's not stopping you from dying.  If you're going to recover, it recovers. You like if you're you. No, that's true, though. It's true. It's true.  I mean, it's not stopping you from it's it's basically helping people that would recover anyway. Like if if you took 14 days to recover it, it changes it to eleven.  But what if they get it too early before the virus has it?  I'm just saying what they end they're saying is not stopping death. It's just helping the people that would recover recover faster, which is great. Yeah. Because they can get back out. That's the last I heard. But like I said, things change all the time.  What you said about what is this?  Oh, my God, I get it for you, you know, OK, let's we'll end with this because we're three hours in. I'm glad you're OK, brother. Thank you to you.

But I've been there and I was in a peaceful way. I cried. I've been attacked. I don't even know. I didn't know how to, you know. Oh, so I was in a taxi. How did the taxi driving down and tell if Taxi hit the guy in the car and they kept going, oh, that's all I need to see.  That's such a generalization. One taxi driver, someone didn't spot.
