 Hello, friends, welcome to the show, this episode, the podcast is brought to you by Trager Grillz, my absolute favorite way to cook. I've been cooking on a Trager Grill long before it was ever a sponsor of the podcast.  It's a peligro which uses just hardwood pellets that are made when someone buys like, say, if you're going to buy some oak, they cut the wood. Well, that hard wood sawdust gets compressed using the natural sugars of the wood, no chemicals. And they make these pellets out of that hard wood. And then you pour those pellets into the hopper. The worm drive feeds those pellets to a heating element. It catches on fire and voila, you're just cooking with fire and wood.  It tastes fantastic. It's my absolute favorite way to cook and it's very easy to use. And it's simple. And it not only is it easy to use, but it's really accurate. It maintains its temperature really well. And they have an application of fantastic all new application that has 1500 plus recipes and you can control your grill with it from anywhere, raise or lower the temperature. It's got a meat probe to tell you what temperature food's at. And with the recipes, you can use the recipes and it will automatically navigate the cook cycle for you on the app.  Come on, baby, and you can cook anything on the trigger grill.

To learn more, my guest today is an independent journalist who drove here across the country in the middle of the pandemic.  He just he decided to to isolate in his own vehicle. He has a bugout van. He's been on the podcast before. I love him. He's a great guy.  Please welcome Tim Poole girlfriend podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast My Night All Day we met Ben.  How's it going, dude?  The ride that you made to get here, you drove from the other side of the continent, you know, Bugout Van.  Well, I mean, you've had guests on who have driven here. And I mean, I drove here. You drove here. But it took four days. It took four days.  It's a different kind of drive. Have you ever done that before?  Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah. Not in the van. But I've driven around the country too many times.  The van is pretty dope. I'm impressed. I told you last year.  Yeah, I was getting the van and I got a bunch of people on Twitter making fun of me. Like always going to get a bug up. Van is crazy. I got a van.  You got to bug out then. You guys live in that thing. Oh, totally. Do the solar power on it. Yeah. Last year forever.  That's pretty amazing. I didn't know that you could power everything. So you have a solar power roof panels that is. Is it less effective in like Jersey where it's cloudy right now?  You know, the summertime. Yeah. How much difference is it once cloudy.  I mean, several orders of magnitude. Yeah. Yeah, like barely work. I mean, it works. It works, it works well enough but right here works great right here. The sun is so intense and just gnarly. You go outside you can feel on your skin. Yeah. My solar things like you're good forever.  Don't want to turn the AC on full blast. Really. If so, if I run the AC on full blast it will probably last.  If I start when the sun comes up it may be like I don't know. Fourteen hours. Wow. That's, that's, that's intense though man. AC if I use just the fan to get circulation, I can play PlayStation, I can watch movies, I can turn the music on full blast.  And you could probably with AC you can probably turn it on and off as the temperature goes up and down. Yeah. And the van is, is it insulated at all. Oh man.  Like crazy. Yeah, yeah, yeah. These guys I was trying to find somebody to help me modify this thing for a while. I think when I was here last time I had the van, but it was empty. And then I found these guys in, in Jersey. They do like they do police modification stuff like gun racks and, you know, like seats. And I guess because the van life thing started getting big, they I did a Google search.  I couldn't find any van life thing.  Yeah. Van Life man. What are you talking about? So on YouTube Van Life was this big trend.  I think it's kind of waning a little bit. But there was one woman who got like two million subscribers and one video because she lives in her van with her pet snake or something like that.  She's probably hot shot.  She's younger, I think so. I haven't actually seen the video. So I'm like making the assumption that, you know, that makes us make a YouTube video. You're a single female in a van, you know, and I think the video was like, here's how I shower. So naturally, you get to go.  It's good move. Yeah, but I masturbate four million views. Yeah, yeah. These guys over where I live, I guess I couldn't find anybody to do this. The wait lists are crazy like they are pro companies that do van modification. Eight month wait period. Really. Yeah. So I went on Google Maps of all places just because I was like, maybe, maybe that's my problem. I typed in van modification and two miles from me, boom, this guy pops up and he does him at his company.  They did modifications for local police departments. I'm like SWAT vans, surveillance vans and. Things like that, I wonder if I'm supposed to be saying that. Probably not. Probably not. But I didn't tell you to keep your mouth shut.  No, actually he was like, yeah, let people know we do this work, you know what I mean? What's the name of the company? Diversified Vehicle Systems. I think, man, if I got that name wrong, I'd feel so bad.  Well, see if you find it. Yeah. Diversified vehicle systems or services.  Yeah. And it's got cool photos of like SWAT vans and stuff I'm stoked to do. You know, he's helped me out. That thing's amazing.  It is interesting that you can power everything from the solar panels. You could power your monitors because you have it set up in there. We have monitors and lights. You have cameras. What kind of do you have an Internet connection?  I use my phones, but there is there is on the roof. This thing called a Weingard and have 5G on your phone, right. Have. Yep. Oh, yes.  Here it is. Diversified vehicle services. That's him. That's the master interior before the van hesitate.  OK, yeah. You're making this guy's week. Good. Cool.  Good for him. He's cool dude. Yeah. So how long did it take for them to check it out. I think it took like a maybe three weeks to a month and felt super confident to drive that thing all the way across the country. Totally. Was it weird at all? I know is pretty awesome.  Was there any spots you stopped and you're like, what in the fuck? Like, oh, Barstow's type type areas there was just because of like the pandemic and all this.  Well, the pandemic and they're weird already.  I've driven across this country too much and I've purposefully in the past have driven through really weird parts like off of interstate highways.  I've been at some pretty crazy places I went to. I've been to one motel that once looked like you'd be a prisoner or something.  You used to be a prison. They turned out, oh, no, no. I'm just saying it looked like it looked like there's no windows. There was just like those block windows you can't see through with, like, the weird wavy glass.  I had no idea what the building used to be, but it was a motel. Now it looked like I was in a meat locker or something.  But there was there's one town I think it was in New Mexico.  I don't want to say the name because I get it wrong, but they put up a sign saying no one's allowed in. Nope. The whole town. The whole town was because of some damage. Yep.  No one's allowed to do that. It's had no visitors, no business, something like that. It said it's like residents only it's not legal. I don't think it is. That's where they get weird.  Right.  A lot of this stuff is like what what is legal as far as like as far as lockdowns, what's legal?  Is it completely up to the this is the debate right now, right. Whether or not it's completely up to the governors, whether it's the mayors of individual liberty and whatever town.  And I mean, I'll tell you what sounds like the Constitution doesn't exist right now. Well, I wouldn't go that far.  I'm not being hyperbolic, but yeah, come on.  There's definitely some protections. Let's put it this way. Let's be as generous as possible protections that are in place to shield the vulnerable people from the pandemic. But a lot of folks feel like there's some overstepping and there's a problem with power, man.  He give power to people. They do not like to give it back.  They always think it's better with me in charge. Yeah, that's why there was one documentary I saw a long time ago.  Some activists went to like the CEO of Shell and he talked to him and he was like, listen, you've got to understand, I'm trying my hardest with me at the helm. I'm doing such good things for the environment. They always think they're the benevolent dictator. That's why I think decentralization is so much more important in in so many different aspects.  Like, yeah, that is a weird trait that human beings have when they get into a position like that. Right. Well, the type of person who would want to be a governor to begin with, the type of person that would want to run the entire state.  Yeah, I don't I don't I don't trust any individual to have good intentions. I should say. They do have good intentions, but I don't trust them to actually know what's best for everybody.  There's no way you can I mean, just to to be able to be accurate about all the different predictions in this in this regard.  You know, when you're talking about this pandemic thing, like one of the biggest problems I'm looking at is who determines what's essential and what's not essential.  Yeah, we'd stores are essential. So we heard it like in Michigan, for instance, they were closing off certain parts of certain stores. Did you hear about this now?  So a lot of people took it because there were photos of seeds at Wal-Mart or something where there was a tape saying you can't you know, this part of the stores closed. And so the story went out that you weren't allowed to buy seeds anymore. No story actually was that stores over 50000 feet had to close off non-essential areas like flooring and gardening and things like that.  And who's to determine what is and isn't essential about any of those services, particularly gardening, and mean if there's a time where you want to have your own food readily available in your backyard, now's the time.  Well, even think about just general hardware if they're going to shut that down, what if what if a hole breaks up into your floor, you know, your kid falls through it or something, you gotta get that fixed.  Yeah, I mean, that's that's a serious safety issue. So you've got these governors determining what is essential and what isn't.  I heard a good argument for keeping liquor stores open because I was like, come on liquor stores. But someone said actually it is to prevent people from going in to detox from having problems detoxing where they would take up a hospital bed that we need potentially need because the virus.  That makes sense. I also. Think about the reality of you take away booze in a time of a crisis and you're going to see people's nerves snap real quick. Have you seen the video of this guy jogging down the street? He examines everybody's recyclables. No, it's all filled with vodka bottles and tequila and whiskey and wine. And he just goes from house to house. It's like to see what they've been up to. Oh, well, people are so stressed out, they're just getting hammered.  Yeah. Would be a lot of liver damage when this is all a lot of glasses too. Yeah. I heard that's that's going up. Oh. People and domestic abuse and things like sugar and suicide. Here's here's the prediction I made.  You know, very early on I was talking to my friends actually I think I said this. What they're going to do, they're going to say we're only going to keep things close until April 12th. And that's what Trump said at first Easter. We're going to come open up. And I said about a week before, they're going to say, oh, we got to push it back. Sure enough, April 30th, then May 15th. Now it's June 1st.  June 1st for who? We just I think New York just announced this.  They said June 1st. Yeah. But I think they said they're going to start May 15th with outside of New York City. Right.  Isn't that what Cuomo said? I'm not entirely sure. But feel like he said I do know a lot of jurisdictions have slowly entered, you know, the phase one. There was that Trump argument with with campin in Georgia about going too fast and stuff like that. Yeah.  So I guess, you know, people start to realize if you don't open things up, there's nothing to save. Right. Right.  What's what's freaky to me about all of this is the tribalism behind whether or not we should reopen the economy or stay locked down. It's connected to everything. Right? What do you mean the tribalism it's going to have? Totally. Yeah, it's so you know, I had a friend messaging me saying we're stupid. People who want haircuts are going to get us all killed and they're going out protesting. And the first thing I'm like, you really don't think just because one guy was playing that dumb song?  That's what everyone is thinking right now. That's not the case. But what's crazy to me is you had the U.N., a U.N. advisor come out and say, we're looking at a hundred and thirty million people are going to starve because of the economic shutdown. And that's going to be much worse potentially than the actual pandemic itself. And these kind of facts are ignored because of the tribalism of what's happening. You know, Trump tweets it out. Therefore, it's an out, right, left, you know, conservative, whatever.  I don't think they know exactly what to do. I mean, I think there's some educated decisions that are being made by medical professionals and then they have to adjust those based on new statistics that come in. And I don't know if they have adjusted like the the initial idea was that there was an X amount of people that were infected in California. It turns out there's many, many, many more. And the most recent thought is that there's somewhere around 400000.  Now, there has been some dispute about these studies. You know, whether or not these studies are accurate, whether or not the tests are accurate, whether or not you could get it again, whether or not even matters if you've already had it, you might be able to get it again. But there's no adjustments. No one saying, hey, this is way less deadly than we thought it was going to be. You know, this this sounds like the problem of government.  You know, I've never been one of these small government types. I'm you know, as much as people might want to argue with me, I lean a little bit left in a lot of issues like government programs, I think are good things.  It just seems like whenever the government enacts something, it's so slow to fix it. If it goes bad or when things change right.  So slow to adjust. If they need to shift back, they tend to just dump more money into it.  If it's not working properly. I want to know why some people just shake this off. That's to me the most.  It almost seems like you're dealing with more than one virus. It's like you're dealing with a bunch of different versions of a virus. I think you are.  I think they've they've said they found multiple strains like that. It's changed a little bit or something. I don't want to know for sure.  I know they did say that about India. They said that the strain that they have in India is apparently very different than the strain they're experiencing in Europe.  Yeah, I think I heard something similar about like Washington.  They found two strains, liberal or non man conservative strains.  Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's the crazy thing to me is the people a lot of Trump supporters. I don't want to I'm not trying a blanket, every single one. But there's some high profile ones that are really acting like since the beginning, they've doubted at every step of the way. And I'm like, have you looked at the spike charts? If you know, here's what I say.  If in New York City we're seeing thousands more dead, what are they dying of, if not some kind of, you know, infection? I mean, you can you can call whatever you want. You can act like nothing's going on. But we're seeing huge spikes in my campaign, attention to them.  There's fools, no matter what you do is always going to be fools. So, you know, it's obviously a real virus.  It's obviously real dangerous. It's the it will tribalism.  It's foolish, but it's it you know, you've got to just dismiss that stuff, can't even debate or dwell on it. But what's interesting to me is, well, there's a bunch of parts that are interesting. But what's interesting to me is like who like George's opened.  Right. And then parts of Montana of opens things that are open in Texas.  Yeah.  Like it's going to be interesting to see what the response is going to be, whether or not they come back online quicker and their economy builds up quicker, or whether or not they get a second surge and they have to shut. Longer and it winds up being that maybe you should have waited longer and would have had less infection, like we just saw a city of 10 million in China under lockdown again, did to what degree? I'm not entirely sure.  But they've announced, you know, reaping all the social distancing measures and certain closures and stuff like that. And they're saying it's because someone, a student, I think they're saying a student from the U.S. came back or they're saying or reignited. But there's also a bunch of studies now about reinfection.  You know, it's it's a whole lot of we don't know.  And everyone's freaking out whenever there's a new disease and everybody's got to scramble in real time to try to figure out what the fuck to do about it. And we're all just weirded out. Everybody's weirded out. You know, no one knows, like, what is normal now? What is what is reality? The reality we live in, like you see movies now when people hug or shake hands and you're like, what are you doing?  I've been watching these commercials. You see these commercials? They're all the same. Where it's like it's like we're all in this together. And then it shows people banging pots and pans and it's like we may not be able to hug anymore, but the love is there. It's like, oh, Christ, all identical.  But then all of a sudden an older commercial pops up. And I was watching this the other day and it's like a guy walks up, shakes his buddies and pats on the back and then like gives his wife a kiss on the cheek. And I'm like, that's an old commercial. That is I can tell it's an old campaign. Yeah. Because they would not do that.  Most of them are old because you can't shoot anything anymore. You know, I don't know how I'm curious how they're doing these commercials where they filmed New York. I guess they're going out in New York and filming people actually, you know, cheer from their balconies and stuff, huh?  Yeah.  Look, you know, I think there's a real there's a real tough question that a lot of people want to ignore. I think there's a lot of Trump supporters who are pushing it because they're in favor of reopening the economy. But there's like that equation of at what point is having things shut down more damaging then, you know, so at a certain point, we have to recognize people can die no matter what we do.  Well, there's a Bloomberg not not the mayor, but there's a Bloomberg statistic on the economy that measures the downside, like when when the economy goes down, how many people die because of it?  And it's you could kind of trace it. It's it's very disturbing. And when we're talking about deaths, we're talking about there's something that we can immediately deal with. It's right in front of us is a disease that's happening right now. Go after it. Stop it. But the secondary reaction to that, in fact, because you're closing the economy, might wind up killing as many people as you're trying to avoid being killing in the long or you know, or more.  Yeah. So I don't know.  The U.N., the big story on the U.N. was that their adviser said two hundred and thirty five million starving, you know, in the next year or so unless things kick back into gear.  Well, hopefully there are going to kick back in the year. California is supposed to open up on May 15th.  But the governor's been I don't I don't know if he enjoys it, but it seems like he seems like they they definitely are comfortable with being the person they get to say, yeah, this is shut down and we're going to keep it shut down. The authoritarianism is scary.  We're the best in people for fucking going to the park with their kids. You see that tweet from the UK where they posted the shadows of the two cops and it was like, think going into a rural area to have a picnic is you'll get away with it. We're going to look out of the shadows and find, you know, I swear to God. Yeah. When do I run?  Once you're in the middle of nowhere having a picnic, go for it. Here's the thing, man. They told fucking China shit in total. That is like, fuck, man.  Well, now there is another story. Bill Gates apparently said, you know, China did a bunch of things right. And now what they're doing is they're taking that out and are putting it next to pictures of them welding doors shut and barricading people on him, hanging out with Epstein.  Oh, probably. That's the latest thing is I've been getting I really don't know this guy. Well, these people are sending me all these videos about Bill Gates. Now, I used to party with Epstein.  You know, a lot of people did. Yeah. I wonder how many of them knew. Well, I don't know.  But a lot of them apparently traveled with Epstein after Epstein had been and convicted.  Oh, man. Yeah. He apparently, like a couple of years after he'd been convicted. It wasn't like you didn't know about it.  Right. Right. Have you seen Bill Gates Instagram? Now, all the comments just flooded with people saying like globalists and Illuminati kind of stuff.  That's all I heard about that. It's a lot of pedophile stuff, too, right? I don't know.  I don't want to I know this is going to be really touchy because you got a lot of really angry people. They're saying things like take your vaccines back. We don't want them. Yeah.  We won't wear the mark of the beast.  You know, a man he's talked about, you know, what China did. They're giving you these codes on your phone. And you've got if you want to leave, if you leave the town, it becomes void. And so if you're in the city, then you can go to a building. They scan it to see if you're clear. And if you are, then you're able to come in.  Yeah, fuck all that. Seriously, I think you know it, man. The amount of people I've seen argue in favor of this executive. You know, these these executive orders is pretty scary. Yeah, I've been scared about that.  We've been talking about that quite a bit lately where I've been saying you can't have massive overreaching government surveillance as a response to a disease.  You can't because they're not going to shut it off. Once the disease has a vaccine, they're going to keep that stuff in place. And you are giving up a massive part of what it means to be an American. Well, to be free, take a look at the social media, what's going on with Twitter, Facebook? They are the CEO of YouTube will start their sat down on CNN. Basically, anyone who says anything out of line with the World Health Organization is expandable to cancer community guidelines.  The World Health Organization has flip flopped back and forth, you know, like several times.  Well, they're clearly spouting out Chinese propaganda, too, particularly in January when they were saying that according to China, there's no evidence it could be transmitted from person to person.  And as you know, the AP reported at that time, China knew and withheld the information for six days. So the day that the World Health Organization tweeted out no evidence, according to China, of human to human transmission, we now know, according to the AP, that China did know and purposefully withheld that what you've got going on with China right now.  I question whether or not we're getting close to an act of war. And I know that might be a little exaggerated, but they've got you know, the story was published in BuzzFeed News. Trolls working either for China or within China, trying to slow down the response in other regions like Spain, Italy, Taiwan, I think I think the Buzby more specifically about Taiwan selling disinformation. So it would slow their response, things like that. Why? Well, I think China wants Taiwan, right.  But they don't.  Was there a rogue province? So they consider it.  Yeah, well, that's why they had instructed the World Health Organization to not even mention the name Taiwan. You saw that video.  That video's crazy, where the head of the World Health Organization is being interviewed. And in the interview, the woman asked him about Taiwan's response and he says, I think China's done a great job. Right.  And well, at first they ignored. Yes. And then he hangs up on it. He hung up, but he did say China and she said Taiwan in specific. And I think that's when he hung up on her. And then he came back, said and she goes, well, let's get back to question. Well, I think we've already covered it.  China's done a great job, like he's clearly avoiding. But why does he think he can do that? Like what? What does China have on them?  Is it fun? Is it China funding them?  I mean, you saw what happen with the NBA and like Wizard. Yeah, people don't want to get that cold, hard cash. They're making a bold bet, you know what I mean? Do you know what Thucydides Trap is, no. So this is I was reading about this, The Atlantic wrote about this in 2015, are we headed for a war with China? And the city's trap says that whenever a growing power seeks to upset the dominant power, it results in war.  And out of 12 out of 16 times of the past 500 years, it has happened.  So people have been predicting a U.S. China war for a really long time because of this historical precedent, if not absolute.  But it looks like I'm accurate, I'm a historical expert or anything like that, but it looks extremely probable to me. I think a lot people get mad at me saying that I was fear mongering by bringing this up. But the U.S. just sent two warships into the South China Sea, which China considers their own territory. When you look at what China has been doing in terms of misinformation, clearly lying about the numbers that, you know, I can't remember who did this, I think it may have been Germany removing China's numbers from the charts saying they're not real.  So China's been misleading the rest of the world, withholding information on how bad the infection is. They sent a strike group, an aircraft carrier, through the South China Sea near Taiwan, putting Japan on alert. The U.S. aircraft carrier Theodore Roosevelt was disabled because of the coronavirus. They evacuated 80 percent of the personnel. The U.S. doesn't what they call an elephant walk in Guam where they have all these bombers. Then the U.S. pulls them out because apparently China's got some kind of weapon that can just blanket Guam and wipe out our forces.  Next thing I know, we sent the kind of weapon they have. They can do that. I'm not entirely sure. You know, I'm getting my information from just reading personal stories. I'm not a military guy or anything like that, but it really, you know, so the U.S. just sent two warships into the South China Sea. And I think they're doing this because one of the things I read from a military website was that the strike force is testing us resolve.  The last time that China has done this, where they sent a strike force around Taiwan, actually tried to take it in some fashion. The U.S. sent a couple of super carriers and everything calmed down. Now our super carrier is in the region, were disabled by covid.  Well, didn't China didn't they go into a group exercise with Iran after we we killed that guy? Oh, I don't know.  There was a group exercise with China and Iran in the sea. They did something like some sort of show of unity right after Trump had that guy assassinated.  Do you see what happened with those Iranian gunboats? They were swarming the U.S. naval vessels and then Trump ordered them. If they do it again, sink them, blow them up. Do you know that Venezuela tried commandeering a civilian yacht a couple of weeks ago?  What Venezuelan naval ship crashed into a German owned private cruise liner? They were trying to my understanding of the story, because I know a lot of people are they're not and want to try that analysis. They were trying to steal it. So they claimed it. Yeah, they so I think the official word from Venezuela was they thought this was a fake cruise ship with assassins for Maduro or something. So they ordered it to come in to their their waters because they weren't Venezuela.  Venezuela naval ships are ramming it sank itself. Yeah, I heard about that. Yeah. Yeah.  And so then sometime after Donald Trump deploys to U.S. naval vessels near Vandersloot, near Venezuelan waters, which he says are for drug related operations, I'm not going to like I know a lot of people can get heated saying, you know what you're talking about.  Yeah. Yeah. All I know is that's what was reported. Who knows what that means or what it leads to. But to say with it, you know, look, Russia is withholding wheat exports. Several European countries have closed their borders within the Schengen area. They're with people trying to hoard food. And we just had a full page ad in The New York Times Sunday edition, I think was from Taison saying the food supply chain is breaking and we're getting ready for a major shortage of food.  Yeah, they had to kill two million chickens. Wow. Because they didn't have anybody to butcher them. Here's here's here's my concern. When you have these nation states shoring up their borders, even within the European Union, that was crazy to me. When you see Germany and France and Austria closing their borders to each other, then you get these warships making these movements. You get people desperate for food. You see Venezuela ramming into a cruise ship. I say this.  It could be that we're hyper focused on it because we're bored. We don't really pay attention to the stuff. We normally pay attention to celebrity gossip and politics. Not that we're not doing anything. We're really focused on what's happening in international territory, or perhaps it's that we're getting desperate and we're scared as the economy tanks.  Why was it for mutually assured destruction? I would say, yeah, we're probably moving into a place of war. When you have two nuclear super powers like China and the U.S., it's like what?  You know, what do they do? What are you going to do?  You're going to one guy go to launch a missile. The other guy's going to launch a missile. What are they going to do? Are they going to go into a full scale war and wipe out everyone on the planet? Because that's what would happen? I think so. I do.  The thing is, who would be more willing to wipe out a giant chunk of the population? Would it be China or would it be the United States?  I don't think it'd be the United States. I think it'd be China.  And I think it really depends on how strange they are for resources and whether or not they're really going to lose the. Difficult luck in China when this broke out, what we saw, videos of them barricading people in their homes, welding their doors shut, the doctor whistleblower, there's one story Vice Rana journalist was calling out. All of these things disappears for a month, comes back a month later, all happy like governments. Great. We love them.  Really? Yeah, we know.  We know what they do. We've seen we've seen videos. Now, this could be propaganda, you know, because I'm in America. So of course, I'm getting this information. Maybe the U.S. is trying to, you know, blow this up. But I think you take a look at that kind of behavior, the willingness to do anything by any means necessary. And at what point do you get one person who's in charge saying, I will not be the captain of a ship that sinks?  You know, I look to well, I don't wanna get super political in American history, but I view it as you've got a leader of a country and as people are looking at him, he says this will be the year my country ceases to exist.  If that presses a button, I will not be the you know, I will not be the person with that stain.  It's hard to know, though, because it could be a leader saying I will not be the person who destroys the world. I would rather go down in history as the, you know, failure of my country. I, I think you back somebody into a corner and you get fight or flight.  I don't trust Trump Trump's decision making in that regard either. Oh, I don't you know, I just I don't trust anybody's decision making.  But anybody who won't admit that he said one thing when we saw this whole thing, disinfection, maybe, you know, the fact that he said he was being sarcastic, that was so dumb.  And if you're that same person and then we want you to be in charge of this decision, whether or not we go to war, I mean, obviously, you have to have the support of Congress.  But this but you know, this this you know, the disinfectant story is the one of the weirdest and most difficult things to actually grasp.  I think you just got caught rambling. That's it. Yeah. You have to.  That's episode of South Park where Cartman pretends like he has Tourette's, you know, so so Cartman finds out that people are threats. Just say all these things. So he's like, if I pretend to have this, I can say whatever I want. And then eventually he loses his filter and starts saying a bunch of ridiculous things, like he's admitting to, like, you know, touching his cousin or something camp. And he's like, why am I saying this?  Oh, no, I've lost my filter. Donald Trump. That's what here's how I see it. He heard something from these experts. He didn't understand it. He has no filter. And so he just asked this thing. Here's here's my challenge with it.  Is there a such thing as a stupid question? Yes, there is. Can you eat glass, right? That's a stupid question. I don't some like performers eat glass. They don't really they don't really do they also chew up candy glass?  Yeah. Here's here's this. Here's the struggle. Here's a struggle. What is it, disinfectant? How do you interpret what he said and here's what Trump supporters immediately fired back with. There is H2O2 Nebulizer and therapy, and they they pulled up an article from it was posted Amazon.com April 10th. One of the treatments they're looking at for covid is to take hydrogen peroxide through a nebulizer into your lungs, that the disinfectant into your body for cleaning. I don't think Trump was going for that.  I think the guy mentioned we have bleach and alcohol. And Trump is like, I wonder if you could, you know, possibly get in their body through the kitchen as a cleaning.  Yeah, I mean, look, well, what's really interesting that came out of this was Twitter banned an account that is a publicly traded biotech account that has a legitimate therapy.  When someone has been intubated, when they've been when they're on a respirator, they can send UV light through that tube and actually kill some of the bad bacteria in the lungs. Now, the video that shows how they do it shows like the tube. And it's like an animated thing which shows the lungs.  They banned them, right? They banned a publicly traded biotech company, which is just I don't know if they banned them because they think that in some way this supports what Trump was saying or if someone just pulled the trigger too quickly, I mean, who's who's doing this over here? I think you have a bunch of fucking kids that are making decisions whether or not something is banned or not. Something gets reported like someone I'm just guessing someone reports and says, look, these fucking idiots are saying that Donald Trump's right.  You can get right in there banning account nugget. We sat here. Yes. With Jack and Veja, Veja. And I don't think we got a definitive answer necessarily. We got to, you know, thank you for your feedback.  I think we got an answer in terms of what Jack wants, in terms of he I think Jack is a legitimately honest guy who is trying to manage things at scale.  And I think that's almost impossible.  I don't the sheer numbers that are coming in and he's trying to do a Wild West Twitter now. This is his concept of having a Twitter that's just wide open. We could do anything and then having like a regular sort of moderated Twitter. There's a there's a name I can say right now, a name if I say a name right now, Candy man. This video will be pulled from YouTube. You know that really, I can say one guy's name, Alex Jones.  No, I'm not. Don't don't say it. If you know what it is, don't say it. I'm not going to start with I don't think I should even do that, really. I've had my video taken down and I've been told to write it down here, write it down for you.  Sure. You're ready to just write it down. If you say this name, your video will be taken out. They take it on C-SPAN. They take down Fox News. Really, that Hitler now.  I'm warning you not to say his name, the company has been unsuspended, if you will, unsuspended for that. So, yeah, so somebody probably fucked up is probably a kid that my handwriting is awful. That's OK. Do not say that name. I'm not kidding with you, man. Do not say that name. I don't even know who that is. He is the he's a I can I can describe to you he's a CIA. He worked he worked for the CIA.  I guess he is accused of being the whistleblower, the Ukraine whistleblower. Oh, and if you say his name, you will get taken down. Wow. This is so that seems like news.  How come how come news will get you taken down. Yeah.  Makes you wonder. Right. How come a biotech company with a legitimate product gets taken down now I guess yourselves restored. Yeah. I think that biotech company somebody fucked up. I think, I think you have to.  I think from what Adam Curry was explaining to me is that there's a bunch of kids that work for Twitter and they work for a lot of these other companies. And they're they're the ones responsible for whether or not something gets bad or something gets taken down. You know, the Zuby store, the OK dude story. Right, right, right. Which is just bonkers. What's for people? So this can be standalone. Zuby, who is a British guy, we've talked about this on the podcast where he's been a guest in the podcast.  He's a rapper, very, very intelligent, interesting guy who doesn't even swear.  He's very polite. He's a really nice guy. So he gets in some sort of an interaction with someone on Twitter. And this person says, I bet I sleep with more women than you. He says, OK, dude, that's it.  He got banned, banned.  He got vended for a long period of time, like weeks or whatever the fuck it is. I don't know how long you get suspended for something like that. But then he asked for it to be reviewed and they upheld it. Yeah, they said yes.  You can't say, OK, do not I don't know if he was talking to a trans woman.  He didn't either. Yeah, he didn't either. Yeah, I know. He didn't know. Is that what it is? Is that what the case was. I, I that's my understanding of the story.  Yeah. Well he didn't even know. Right.  He just saw someone and said, OK, dude, you know what the problem is this idea of approved truth, what YouTube calls authoritative sources. So I know I'm pretty hard on YouTube, but this doesn't involve Facebook as well. That name I sent you, Facebook will delete your post without notice if you type it.  Wow. So here's what I did. I tried it. I typed. I just I said something like I heard of a man from Dubuque, an orthodontist named who has five kids and he's in his mid 50s. I did that because that in no way describes who that person is. Right? Not not only did Facebook delete it, they deleted it without telling me it was just erased from the site gone.  So it's some sort of a filter that's in place. No, no. Somebody manually did it. It was there for a while and then somebody came in somehow. So. So do you know what happened with CNN, Chris Cuomo getting getting covid? You know, they faked that whole thing, right?  What do you mean affected? So Chris Cuomo was spotted thirty minutes from his house on a property with a new with a new construction being built. Yes, a steel frame. A guy on a bike saw him. Chris Cuomo, they got into it. Chris Cuomo goes on his radio show. And I don't want this jackass on a flat tire. But coming up to me, I should tell him what I want. The guy on the bike says he called the cops and said he threatened me.  So this basically confirms the encounter. Chris Cuomo then shot a segment for CNN of him emerging from his basement. Like, this is what I've been dreaming of, finally getting out of my basement to my kids. But he was witnessed seeing his kids somewhere else with his kids. Yeah. So you even had that. You even had Ben Smith, The New York Times call this out, saying Ben Smith used to be the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News.  Now he's a media columnist for New York Times, said something to the effect of it's like shocking how CNN is eliding this whole controversy there like it didn't happen. Everybody knows Cuomo faked it. He wasn't in quarantine. He was out. Presumably he was he was with two women and three kids. So we can we can assume it was his wife and his kids, whatever. I bring that up because you've got a couple other moments, right? You've got Brian Stelter on on his show saying that we got to channel the anger for the people.  Yeah. That he was saying that journalists need to do that.  Which is which is, you know, I basically said, so you're admitting your rage. But yes, I saw you did that. And I was glad that you said that, like, finally they're admitting it. Right?  Right, right. I mean, look, it's no secret I'm going to rag on on the media. I worked for these companies and I've seen them slowly getting worse and worse with everything.  I want to see Brian scream. You want to see Brian scream? Yeah.  I think like him enraged would be a dog.  Like, I don't I wonder how much anger he can muster. I can't. I can't. So so here's here's the point. I was getting to CNN's called an authoritative source. They're lying in our faces. I mean, you just had the Joe Biden thing. I don't know if you've talked about this yet, but if you go to Google Play and look up Larry King's show from 1993, you will see there. So actually, I checked many of the different months.  What people noticed was that one episode was missing August 11th, 1993, the episode where Joe Biden's accuser called in saying, my daughter had a problem with a prominent senator, knows Joe Biden's accuser's mom, the accusers.  What did I say? You said accuser. All right. He's accusing the accuser's mom, right? That episode's gone. Yes. So I went through Google Play and there certainly were other episodes that were presumably missing, typically Mondays, where I assume I would assume that, you know, Larry King had a day off or something.  The eleventh was a Wednesday. Why was this missing? Why did CNN. Why were they. But on their own story, they had this evidence, apparently this was this was news. So when you look at what CNN has been doing, admitting that they're doing wrage journalism, you get people like Jim Acosta.  But isn't that what Brian said? What's Brian Stelter? Helter Skelter? Isn't he just that's his own opinion.  You know, I mean, it's not that they're admitting that they're doing wrage journalism. It's he's saying that they should do that. Right? Isn't that what it was? And he said it on Twitter, right?  Yeah. It was a quote from his show. Was it? In fact, you would think it was reliable sources tweeting it out. And, you know, look, I may be hyperbolic or whatever because I got my opinions on on CNN and all that, but take a look at someone like Jim Acosta. He stands up, he argues with the president as a journalist, as supposed to do. You know, if you want to ask the president a question, he gives you an answer.  If he if you have the opportunity for follow up, you do. And then you write your story and you fact check him. You write your story and say Donald Trump. Here's what he told us. Here's the truth. That's what journalists used to do.  Now you've got this idea of channeling the rage for the people. What that means is it's something I've seen an activist circles where I was explained to me that what people are looking for is someone to strike down a symbol of what they view as their enemy or the cause of their problems. So the reason why someone like Jim Acosta would do so well, he would get so many followers constantly doing this. It's not that he's asking any real questions or actually challenging the president.  It's that the people who don't like Trump see him as striking a symbol down. It doesn't matter if he's telling you the truth or not. Now you get performative journalism where Chris Cuomo pretends to come out of his basement, where, you know, you get people standing up at the White House, correspondents at the press conferences just arguing instead of actually asking questions. And then YouTube, Facebook and Twitter say this is the truth. We deem it so.  YouTube now puts them, among other outlets, on the front page of the website, guaranteeing hundreds of millions of views. Meanwhile, independent commentators like myself, we actually get hurt in the algorithm. If you go to my channel, they only show you Fox News. If you want to watch me, then you are guaranteed in the sidebar. The next debate will be Fox News. They prop up all of these channels. David Pakman, for instance, you get MSNBC, Jimmy Door, Fox News.  I don't understand why they're going to send Jimmys, you know, lefty followers to Fox News, but they're doing seemingly everything their power to make sure individuals like myself and other commentators are struck down while channels like CNN, Fox and MSNBC are propped up, even though we know that they put out fake news.  But isn't that because of the algorithm, though? And do you think that algorithm is engineered or was leaning towards those mainstream? Absolutely.  We can see. We can see when it happened, it was May of last year. I've looked at my analytics around the time these smaller pieces came out arguing that there was a rabbit hole where if you watch one kind of contents, all you get. It's a very, very misleading way of framing what was really going on. And I I'm surprised that YouTube just bent over for this. You basically have YouTube's competition, these media outlets using their media weight to hurt YouTube in ad sales.  So YouTube says, you got it, we'll give you front page access, will guarantee you, you know, people watch your content. Right.  But they're doing that because that content is very popular and that generates ad revenue.  Well, I would I would I would say no, actually, I would argue against that. Well, OK, listen, Tucker Carlson, for example, you ought to know he's hugely popular. If you have a Tucker Carlson video is going to generate millions of views. Absolutely. So YouTube within their best interests.  I'm talking about Alisyn Camerota. Is anybody really Google searching on YouTube? Alisyn Camerota is opinion on this all day?  I don't think so. I think I don't know who that is. Right, exactly. And so you wouldn't be searching for it, Tucker? Of course we know.  So you're saying it's the channel in general, not just someone who's popular like Sean Hannity or Tucker Carlson.  They as as very famous personalities, very obviously do get, you know, more get more naturally. So people are searching for Tucker all day and night, Hannity and Rachel Maddow, things like that. Right. But if you if you look at what YouTube has even said to CNN, they prop up authoritative sources.  Yes.  If you search for a news story, guess who you're going to get if you Google search, you know, Tahari, Joe Biden, you're going to at CNN.  Do you think they're doing that, though, because they're trying to get rid of conspiracy theories? Yes.  Yeah, that's right. That's the reason. Yeah. They're trying to get like I understand what they're saying in terms of. So like the CEO of YouTube when she said that they're going to go with the World Health Organization, I don't think it's a good idea to go with the World Health Organization because it seems like it's a very corrupt organization. But I do understand this desire to go towards respected and established medical professionals. I respected an established medical professionals, have a protocol for dealing with coronavirus.  We should listen to them, right? Absolutely. And there's a lot of wacky fucks online that are trying to say that it's not a real virus and that it's 5G. And there's all that kind of stuff is dangerous.  You know what they told me, don't you think? Absolutely. Absolutely. But they told me they published the editorial guidelines very early on. I did a video about this January. Twenty third when they first started locking down, I did a segment talking about what's going on. And I actually didnt think it was a big deal. This was before anybody was really covering it. I mean, this is, you know, impeachment was happening and YouTube fully monetized it.  So I have a thing on YouTube called self certification where when I upload a video, they ask me, does your video contain any of the following? My videos are always clean, family friendly. I don't swear. And I was approved. Video monetized. A week later, they implemented a new change without telling anyone anything. Anyone talking about coronavirus was instantly demagnetized ranked possibly had your videos harder to find things like that. And it wasn't until about a couple of weeks ago they overturned these new rankings on my channel.  They told me before they published the guidelines you cannot say these things, one of which was that it may have emerged from a biolab. Now, we have on April, I think I think it was a 16th, a former Clinton administration NSC staffer saying that Occam's razor suggests the most likely place that this came from was breaking out of a biolab. There was a story by Brett Bayer over at Fox News where he said, according to sources he has, who have overseen the documents, they believe that China was trying to essentially prove they're there, they're worth with American bio research by racing to do this development.  And there was a breach and this resulted in in the current outbreak. That's that's FOX News and CNN, CNN's run multiple segments saying this. When I talk about it, I get direct demagnetize confirmed. They say you can't talk about this. CNN can their authoritative. You can't. Even if I use them as a source, even if I say like. So if what I try to do is, you know, weigh the sources, how good are they?  Bret Baer? That's a good source.  I mean, Bret Bear is one of the last true news people.  I don't I'm not somebody who follows him too much, but he's a straight news guy. He put his name on this. And that says a lot to me. You don't got to like the guy you've got like Fox News. But CNN also ran the story saying U.S. intelligence now believes or I'm sorry, they're investigating whether this claim has merit. We also had a story from The Washington Post that asked the same question, even got a professor from Rutgers University to say it's very possible the story actually emerged because at South China University, I think South China University in Beijing released a paper saying that somebody was doing experiments on Babatz with coronavirus and one of the bats spilled blood on them and peed on him and he had to self quarantine for 14 days.  Being that the Wuhan CDC, I think it's the CDC is about 300 meters away from the from the food market. It seems like that was a likely scenario. They eventually retract that, retracted that paper.  So fuckin movie scene. Totally. So, look, it's not it's not me saying it.  I understand what you're saying. But but I get I get knocked down for this. I'm not just talking about it.  I understand. But I think in their defense, some of this has to be that they're managing at scale. Some of this has to be the fact that millions of videos are uploaded every day and they have to keep this dense disinformation from spreading out of control. When you have all these fucking nut jobs are saying this is 5G, isn't even a virus, it's radiation sickness. Someone sent me a guy that I really like, sent me this video of his doctor that seems like he's got schizophrenia or something he's talking about.  This is a plasma disease caused by radiation. And I'm like, oh, fucking Christ, imagine I've gotten so many people hitting me up.  Tim, you got to talk about five G. Oh, God damn you. You know how many people hit me up when Fauji came out?  Listen, five G is a thing, right? It's a it's a new bandwidth for cell phones. It's going to be really fast. It's going to be in your phone. So the question is like, OK, all this stuff's flying through the air. There's always signals to the air. What effect do they have on the human body? That's a good question. That's a good question. But to say that that's responsible for this coronavirus thing is fucking crazy.  Totally.  If you're saying they don't have any effect and here's why I go, OK, this is why you don't need to be worried about UHF or Veve or whatever different waves that are flying around through the air, wi fi.  And people are worried about all that kind of shit. They're really concerned that this does have some sort of effect on human beings. They think that, in fact, cell phone signals have an effect on bees. And that was one of the primary theories about the drop in bee populations. Yeah, colony collapse.  Now, these cell phone signals are interfering with these bees ability to communicate. But to say that it's the fucking coronavirus like Jesus Christ.  And then someone had a mean little Duval had a meme that he put up on his Instagram and I retweeted it five G's only in five countries. You fuck, right? This goddamn shit is spread across the whole world. And you really think it's 5G?  It's the I believe YouTube has to step in and they have to do something when shit like that is so egregious, is so preposterous. So the question is, where do they draw that line? It would be nice if they could watch all your videos and say, oh, well, those are really reasonable guy.  They do OK. But do they do they really know that? Yeah, they do. They really know the guy who's doing it. Yes. Who is one hundred percent dedicated to watching everything you do. You put out a lot of fucking kind. I do. I much content you put out every day. So if you had to guess at an average right now as of the past few months, up to about three, three hours and forty minutes per day.  So you've got a guy that's dedicated at YouTube. His job is what do you do with the temple guy?  I just so first, probably not like that specific, but I do have a partner manager.  I do have every single video I put out on my my, my, my, my main channel is reviewed one hundred percent of them.  And they just recently introduced my, my other two channels. So I have I have a total of three channels under my name where I put out around ten to twelve separate videos per day for total about three hours and forty minutes.  They, they do so. If I upload a video, it gets reviewed, so I first self certify, I say this video has no swearing, it has no extreme imagery or anything like that.  If someone watches it and monetizes it, I then contact Google and they reverse it for me. So I actually have someone who fixes this. If there's an issue that they watch every episode, they could watch every episode, every episode.  That's bonkers. So you've got a guy who that's their job. I don't think it's necessarily one person, but a team of freaks. My understanding is it is California based.  And so so here's where I look. I'm I think YouTube's a very, very awesome thing. I wouldn't have a show. I'd be working. I was working for a Disney company and I did not like it. And I was able to leave and start my own business. And I'm rather successful with it. And it's because of YouTube and it's because they view me as trustworthy. They you know, I've known them for a long time. They've worked with me.  It's not perfect. The challenges, fundamental human rights and the and the collapse of the media industry when we have news outlets that. So it was I'll give you an example. You posted this on Instagram that people were calls for poisoning. You know, disinfected ingestion had gone up after Trump's comments. Right. That's not true. As fake news, I felt for two.  I tweeted out, I tweeted the George George Carlin quote, the one that's a think about how stupid the average person is and realize half of them are stupider than that. Sure enough, it turns out they faked the story. The real story is that since the start of the pandemic, people have been buying more cleaner than normal. So statistically, with more people having cleaner, they're more likely now to accidentally ingest it.  And since March, the calls have been going up. The New York Daily News, one of the main purveyors of the story, tacked on after Donald Trump's comments on unrelated, unrelated, unrelated dirt.  So here's the problem.  If The Daily News, if CNN, if FOX, if MSNBC, if these outlets are going to do these things in a desperate bid to stay alive as their as their methodology fails and YouTube is going to give them preferential access, which is what they've done, then we're in serious trouble.  But they don't give the Daily News preferential. No, like a channel. The main networks, I don't think I it works aren't that egregious. Right.  Here's here's one that really gross me out was CNN, I believe they tweeted one of the reporters at CNN tweeted that Elon Musk has not supplied all the ventilators that he promised. And then Elon said, Are you aware that Twitter has a search feature? And then he starts retweeting all of these different hospitals, showing the ventilator's people, thanking him.  It has a Tesla logo on it.  And and and it was the hospitals that requested them specifically and they were specific parameters. So, you know, what CNN did argued semantics. The article that was written to to to prove they were right was that those aren't ventilator's real ventilators are invasive ventilators that go in your body.  And CPAC pap is a ventilator, is a ventilator, as is a BiPAP, but they're called non-invasive or nonintrusive.  That's such a fucking gross way to justify what you tweeted. And so journalists are supposed to help you understand what's going on in the U.S., not confuse it for the goal of making money.  But that's that's what it is, right? It's about click bait. Absolutely. You can click bait. The smartest man in the world fucked up and didn't give the ventilator's I.  Oh, you don't know what the scariest thing is.  CNN anybody's network. Any of these networks can make a fake story, get a million views a day later, apologize, retract. And they keep all the money they made. They don't gotta give it back. So they're actively incentivized. I'm not saying they're sitting there, you know, twirling a moustache, being like, let's write a fake story.  But they know that if they do, they get paid and they sell what you know what the fake news is? A million hits. The retraction gets thirty K. We get paid for both.  So this is an editorial review fail where editors are not reviewing these articles that are being written by journalists.  I think they're all swimming in a toilet, circling, you know, down to the drain, because what happens is somebody so I saw a story written, I think it was an op ed for The Washington Post or something about Trump's alligator moat as fake news.  That was never real. The alligator. Right. Right. So the story from 2017 that Trump talked about putting alligators in a moat around the southern border or something was like, it's ridiculous.  But here's what happens. You write a fake story. They wrote that. Yeah.  So that was his idea to do that. It's been a while.  My understanding of the story was that a source familiar with Trump's thinking said that Trump had discussed an alligator moat.  And I'm like, even if Trump did, isn't it obvious? It was a joke. They say they run. They want to go nuts and alligators.  Would it take to guard the southern border thousand miles or whatever? But now now we see this pop up again. And I'll tell you what, man, the scariest thing is how these social the social networks remove, like we talked about last year.  They remove a certain. Point of view like this biotech company, they default on what is authoritative and authoritative, falls in one direction almost every single time, falls left, right?  Yes. So, you know, I can't tell you how many how many stories I've gone through where it's like, you know, that Peter Navarro story where Trump said to the journalist, you're a nasty, nasty reporter and everything. Yes. What you don't see was the full context where the guy kept goading Trump for like 10, 15 minutes. And then finally Trump snaps at him and they take that one sound bite and say, look at Trump just being a dick.  It's like, well, yes, Trump's got no filter and he gets mad. But they cut out the entire exchange where this dude was poking and prodding and, like, really just insulting the guy. So this guy, Peter Navarro, he's saying things like, why are you trying to give people hope? Don't you think that offering up false hope is wrong? And Trump's like, no, I don't think so.  I think this was in chloroquine hydrolysate chloroquine.  So you get you get a guy that keeps, you know, goading him and arguing with him. And that's what I was saying earlier. It's these people for CNN and whatever network have realized, hey, we're going to get ratings. Well, let me tell you this.  First of all, that way of communicating is fucking terrible.  It's second only to the terribleness that in those late night news shows where they have three different people, like three of the screen separated into three chunks. And this person on the right is arguing with this person and left. The moderator is trying to keep everybody in order. And everyone's talking over everybody and everyone's looking for a soundbite and everyone's looking to get their shots in before the buzzer because there's like a bell coming when the commercial runs. It is the dumbest way to really explore a complicated idea.  Right. And second only to that is these fucking things where the president stands the podium and people yell things out. Then someone called it the common flu. Someone called it the common flu. Do you do not denounce that this racist word, kung fu?  And Trump said, who said it? Yeah, I don't know. I heard I don't know. You know, I loved when one of the journalists asked Trump what the price of oil. He goes, where's it at? And the guy says, Oh, I don't know. But I you. No, no, no. Where's the price of oil there? Porter says, I don't know. Then why are you asking next question.  Yeah, these people don't they don't know what they're look, I've sat in these rooms at press conferences. I have stood in front of public officials as they prepared an announcement. And I know exactly I have talked to these producers. I've talked to the journalists. They're like, ask a question. What should I ask? Just just ask anything. So I've been thrown in front of people, like ask him something.  I'm like, what am I supposed to ask him? Ask him anything, make something up, because they want you to get that screen time so they can say it's theirs.  Well, it's also someone like Jim Acosta, for example. Don't you think there's an inclination when someone gets a certain amount of attention to lean towards that attention? This is your base now.  These are the people that are supporting you and you find it was like online commentators and where what's really weird is when, like, a person used to be left and then you see them getting a little bit of love from the right and they start kind of inching over there in their comments and they get more and more attention and then they just jump ship.  And the inverse, like people who were leaning towards more right wing talking points, got attacked for it and then immediately came out in support of certain politicians. Yes, yes, yes.  You see people leaning towards what gets them the most amount of love. Right. And for Jim Acosta, like it seems like he gets a lot of love for attacking this guy because he's talking for them, for the people at home. I wish I could ask the president, what the fuck are you doing to get them, Jim?  And this is the it's and it's it's scary when I go on to read it, for instance, and they've basically purged ninety percent of any pro Trump point of view. Really, that's gone, man. I pull up, I pull up, read it and what do I get. It's it's all lefty commentary. If you go to like our politics, which has I think, you know, five to six million subs, they use left wing activist websites as news sources.  So it's not a place for real political discussion. It's a place to get your biases confirmed.  The same the same is true for the Donald Trump sub Reddit, which has been basically purged, you know, like they used to have a real sub Reddit called The Donald and Kill. Yeah, they killed it. They killed it because they thought that it was filled with trolls. Right. They killed it because they claimed the Trump supporters were threatening cops.  I'm not joking, that's the that's the story. Doesn't that sound a little strange to you that Trump supporters would be anti cop?  To a sense, so that doesn't make any sense, that you would use that as an example for a necessary a necessary move to ban the entire Subrata, it seems like.  So it's not banned. What is it? It was quarantined quarantine. So you can no longer you can no longer search for it.  The only way to access it is to be subscribed and to like, give your email. They've since abandoned that and created a new website, The Donald. When you go there, you're going to hear only good things about the president. And while there are certainly things you just like any rational person, would disagree with, I think a healthy discourse tries. You know, you what you want to see the counterpoints, you want to see the positive points.  You want to better understand. You know, is there a real reason why Donald Trump did something or is he just an idiot? And if you're only getting one side of it, your your your your view of the world is just total.  And it used to be like the Wild West, right? It was pretty wild until 2016. There's very little moderating.  Reddit is so incredibly easy to manipulate and control at ridiculously easy that, you know, I, I remember. And what year was maybe 2015? Political operatives were seeking ways to prop up politicians manipulating its algorithms because users have direct control of it. I just tell you, it's ridiculously easy to do like insanely easy. They've since made it more difficult. But one person with a hat with with 10 cell phones and you could own the front page of Reddit very, very easily.  Since then, we've seen accusations of and I think it's fair to say, you know, in my experience, I know that this tends to exist sock puppetry when someone runs multiple accounts, but maybe different people to create the perception of consensus. Yes.  And that's what they do. That's really, really common. Supercute. I know a guy who is a moderator read it and told me there's one account, had nine different people or a nine one person had nine different accounts they were using to attack this guy.  And you can. So the way Reddit works for those who don't know is you upvote and downvote something. If it has more upvotes, it moves up. If it has more downvotes, it does. It slowly disappears. So if you create a bunch of different accounts using proxy servers or, you know, other IP manipulation, you can make sure your post is always in front.  No. Was there a concern that the Donalds that the Donald Reddit site was being manipulated, that some that there were basically just using it early on?  Yeah. Yeah, there was. So The Donald Post would frequently hit the front page of all. So if you go to read it and you want to see every Subrata, the Donald was always on top. Sometimes it was so active.  It depends on who you ask right for because people were manipulating in one of the other.  I it's there's a good argument for for both. I don't have the evidence to to give you a definitive answer. I think it's fair to say that Trump supporters will smash the upvote button, make sure those posts always fly to the top because they're very enthusiastic, very enthusiastic.  It's also possible that somebody had a bot, you know, botnet that was, you know. That's right. Yeah, yeah, yeah. But one of the things that the Donald got in trouble for, I think, was they would they would do what's called a sticky post. So that means if you went there, one post was always on top of their page so that supporters knew to vote, it guarantying.  It would get a lot of traction. But we actually saw this is the craziest thing. The CEO of Reddit manipulated in the database, someone's comment, who was a Trump supporter. This actually this is like could you imagine the CEO did this? They edited it. He went into the database, the hard database for someone's comment and changed what they said.  What? Yeah, he apologized for it, saying, I got the I got angry. Someone called him a pedo. So he was like, oh, yeah. And he went in. Oh, that's right.  I remember this. He actually edited the words to make that person write a piece of shit like anti Trump or something.  Yes. So I'll tell you what, man, look, there's there's there's a lot of arguments you can make about policy and the right way to solve these problems. But I go on the front, I go I open Reddit, I'm browsing through it, and I see these comments from people that clearly do not understand what's going on with these protests that people want the economy to reopen.  And I try and talk to my friends about it. And it seems like they're trapped because I think, you know, it's like you were mentioning how people drift towards what gets them the most love. But now it's not just famous people. It's not just people on social media. It's everybody who does that. And they don't want that world view broken.  Well, they also don't want to lose the respect of their friends who are also subscribing to the same ideology.  Yeah, yeah. That's a big part of American politics.  Well, over here in California, if you're if you're not left wing, if you don't, you know, just instantaneously when when there's an issue instantaneously side with the left, you get chastised and you get called a racist or you could call the Nazi, you could call to a Trump supporter or you can't even have a rational perspective on things you can't say something like in.  Hindsight, it was a good idea that Donald Trump closed off travel from China because it was coming from there and a lot of people were calling him racist. It turned out to be a good move and then they've shut it down from a lot of different places as well. You can't say that. So.  So, yeah, right. So the first thing Trump does is the task force. Two days later, the travel ban. Joe Biden says the last thing we need is Trump's Islamophobia. Then on March, I think 12th, Trump suspends travel from Europe. Joe Biden says a travel ban won't stop this April 3rd. Biden says actually Trump was right about that. Now Joe Biden is launching ads saying Trump didn't go far enough.  Now Nancy Pelosi is saying Trump should have banned Americans from coming back in to see the video where Nancy Pelosi is talking about telling people to go to China to endorse that video is fucking insane. And when they confront her on it on Fox News, I think was Chris Wallace on Fox News, was talking to her about it. She's saying, well, the record will show that. I was saying, don't be rude to Chinese people.  Now, you were down there encouraging it. Yes. And the record will show she's such an ineffective speaker. It's so bizarre that she got to a position of power because she's she's so disingenuous and so fake in the way she communicates, especially on those shows. Maybe she's just old. Maybe she was better before. I don't know. Maybe that's the place in question.  This. Oh, man. Yeah. The Biden question, that dude's not even he's not even here anymore.  It's so weird. It's so weird. They're pretending that it's OK that this is going to be fine.  But the way they're defending him over these allegations, is this the creepiest thing underscoring the allegation.  You see Alyssa Milano when she says, what is this? Yeah. She said deserves due process.  One of the other times when all the other people this is it's you know, I can't predict what's going to happen. There's a lot of things that are changing, you know, right now that's going to affect whether or not Trump wins the Republicans win or lose.  But what about is this weird thing that he wants to do where he wants to insist on a woman of color as a vice presidential nominee?  Biden wants to I think he said I'm not sure. He said women of color. I think he said he's he's it to be a woman and he's looking at a woman of color. I'm not entirely sure. To me that's that's absurd. I mean, if if you if you've got a good candidate, I think, you know, I don't care what they look like, what their skin color is, their race, gender. I know a lot of people on the left view that as like short sighted because and I think there's there's decent reasons to talk about how identity plays, you know, into how you view the world and the policies you want to implement.  I just think it's dangerous to create that kind of you know, we're not talking about prom queen.  We're talking about someone who actually has a real important job.  I you shouldn't pick them based on what part of the world their ancestors are from or what gender they are.  That's ridiculous. I would actually say on a scale of one to 100, that's not near like the top 50.  But I think it is fair to say that there's a real reason why that would play a factor, play a role like you've got a lot of people who have never experienced certain things, and that includes the left.  And one of the big problems I have in politics is what we see coming from the left is really based on urban living and from conservatives on more likely to be rural living.  So when you see people on the left argue for like rent strikes and things like that, well, yeah, you're in it. You're in cities where you're predominantly renters. So that's your big issue. It doesn't resonate the same with people who live in areas where they primarily own their homes or we're talking about the Second Amendment. Like obviously people in cities, they tend to be liberal. They want gun control. Yeah, because you've got a very, very dense population.  Gun accidents probably are an issue and you've got cops within a minutes notice you live in a rural area. The cops are 40 minutes away. You need to protect yourself. So this this divide creates a difficulty in creating policy for the entirety of the country.  I should point, I personally would never play someone like racial identity or gender in the top priorities. But I do think it is fair to point out that, you know, a black woman is going to understand things about life in the black community that a white man is not going to. That doesn't mean you give him a job because of it. You can point out the perspectives will be different. I agree with both those things. Right.  That's a good point, too, in terms of the overall country is so enormous and it's so different and varied. Like to find some common ground amongst everyone is so incredibly difficult.  So it's a contest of who's got the bigger, bigger bucket. Yeah, the bigger electoral bucket.  Yeah, that's a good way of putting it too. Yeah. Yeah it seems like. But either way there's so many people that are just going to vote left to get Trump out of office. They don't care. They're going to elect a guy with dementia.  You got to pull out this article. Stay alive. Joe Biden by the Atlantic. No, I'm not kidding. When do they point this out?  A couple of weeks ago. Maybe it's called Stay Alive, Joe Biden, all something. And then she said something like, all we need is your corporeal form.  And it's it's amazing you're going to go crazy. It's not not only arguing that we just need Joe Biden's body, but it actually kind of argues he's a bad candidate. And it's like it doesn't matter, though. It doesn't because we just don't like Trump.  Well, they're right about that. He's a. Bad candidate Biden. Yeah, they could have done so much better with to judge with Klobuchar, with their terrified so gabardine, they're terrified of Bernie Sanders and Andrew Yang, I think probably freaks them out a little bit, too.  I was I'm a I'm a big fan of Chelsea and followed by Yang. And a lot of people didn't like that because, you know, I rag on Democrats all the time. It's like more I'll fully admit you can criticize me all day and night. I very much see Pelosi and Schiff, Nadler and like, you know, the problems we have with them. And I'm not a fan of their policies. I think they got, you know, that their do nothing.  But, you know, within that, I saw Andrew Yang and his website, the list of things he's gone through, what he's thought about was was insane. I mean, the dude had a policy for everything.  That was a brilliant guy. Absolutely.  And he's also not a politician. So his approach is going to be from a guy who's an entrepreneur. Right. A guy who looks at it in terms of problems to fix.  You could you can argue there's a similar thing there with Trump being a businessman. But Yangs list is a comprehensive list of policy positions. Was it was to me, I was like, I like it. I do totally not that guy.  The thing about Trump is a giant personality. Right? Whereas Yang is a really reasonable person.  Yeah. For me, you know, Tulsidas anti-war stance was paramount. I think the U.S. has wasted too much money. We've got people arguing for, you know, fix the pipes in Flint. And I'm like, right on. Let's stop building weapons and doing deployments and trying to control these foreign countries and start working with an America. And I think that there's a reason why a lot of moderates and conservatives like Tulsi, and it's that it's kind of America first, right?  Yeah. And why are we applying so much of our resources and time and energy to these foreign countries? We shouldn't be doing that.  But also, she's earned that perspective with two tours of duty overseas. She served and, you know, the armed forces. She's been a congresswoman for six years. She understands a lot about how this works. I disagree.  I disagree with her on some of our domestic policy issues, nuclear energy and. Well, what is her stance on nuclear?  She opposes it. She opposes I don't want to speak for her because I'm trying to be very careful. But negative view on nuclear energy and nuclear energy is different than Three Mile Island or Fukushima.  We need to understand that when you're looking at some of these issues that they have with Fukushima in particular, which is a kind of an antiquated system that they had set up, that they can't really shut off, which that whole bit about how crazy that is.  But when you're talking about the nuclear power that they could implement today, it would be a very different system, right?  There would be a fairly clean, extremely high return on energy investment and zero emissions. Yes, but there's a fear because of the past. Let's put it somewhere that sucks. Let's put it somewhere that sucks. But a big one.  So it sucks and juice up the whole country with it.  You know, when it when it when it came to Yáng, I felt like here with a guy who I'm not a big fan of UBI and it's a weird one. Right. I think the way he put it spoke more to me than the way anyone else ever framed it. And I actually felt like he shouldn't have called it universal basic income when he didn't call it the freedom dividend.  Right. Yeah, but it became UBI to so many people. That's why they went with it. Yeah. When you see, you know, Amazon, Google, these big companies becoming just insane behemoths that can't you know, they can't be broken up. They just absorb and absorb and absorb. Then there's an argument for some kind of dividend to the American people for potentially what they do outside of the United States.  It's very complicated up in economics. I guess I'm not smart enough to, you know, pretend like I know anything about.  But you look at Iraq, the example of Alaska, they have the oil drilling, the people who live in Alaska. I get a portion of that revenue in those profits. That makes sense.  You, by the way, it's framed in general, makes very little sense. And eventually, I think we're actually seeing now with a government stimulus one of the biggest pitfalls to it. Do you hear there's a there was a story they ran an NBC, a woman. Her employees were like in revolt because she acquired a loan from the paycheck protection program that ensured their jobs, meaning they would receive less money because under the Carers Act, they would have received a bonus of six hundred dollars per week on top of the salary they'd normally get.  They actually preferred to have lost their jobs. So you have people who are complaining that they're keeping their jobs now.  So they're that's one instance, though.  There's a couple of stories like that. But the challenge with just giving people cash cash is the assumption that the cash has inherent value when the value of it is based upon what you can get for it. So one of the lessons I think we learn now with the economy being shut down is.  Doctors and nurses got to work, you know that we need them on the front line, they're also getting paid. What do they use that money for? Pay their rent, buy food, things like that. We're having we're facing food shortages if you can't buy anything with the money. What's the point to take in the money? I mean, like, if you were given the choice, you're going to work, you're going to work your job at a grocery store, you're an essential worker.  We're going to pay for and a your buddy who isn't.  Let me stop you right there, because the universal basic income was not designed to deal with a pandemic. It was designed to deal with automation, which would have not stopped the supply chain, which is not stopped, which wouldn't have created food shortages. This is a sort of a unique situation. So you're comparing apples to oranges. You're applying universal basic income to our current situation, which has nothing to do with the reason why he wanted to implement it in the first place.  He's worried that automation is going to take away jobs right away.  Will it not consider this problem, though? There will always be some kind of essential work, right? Yes. What you tell the essential worker when other people are getting money and don't work, that you have no choice because you're essential even in an automation system. So let's say every job. But but hold on a second.  They're only getting a small amount of money to stay alive. You would rather have a good job where you getting paid well and have benefits and all that other stuff? I think that's an assumption. I see it is an assumption.  But the thing is, universal basic income, the real problem with there's a psychology is issue. The real problem is the way human beings work. We need incentives. We don't people don't just want to survive and get a little check from the government will be people be despondent. You know, you don't want to create the United States of welfare like an all encompassing thing where some, you know, these programs that are in place that automate all of the goods and services, they take some of that money and give it back to the people because no one can work like that.  So that's a depressing dystopian future. I mean, that's a terrible place to live.  Do you ever watch Battlestar Galactica? Yes. Loved Yevsey. Snowpiercer.  Was that then you talk about the new Battlestar Galactica, the new one. What was Snowpiercer? Which one was.  That's where Chris Evans is on a train that travels around the world because the world is frozen and only that train has like it's kind of a weird premise, but there was an episode of back. Oh, no, no, no. It's a movie.  I just bring up two different bits of fiction to, you know, make a point.  Oh, yeah. It's a futuristic movie. It's real weird. Who else is in it? Chris Evans capital is in it. Yeah, I think I did see that. It's real weird. Yeah, it's kind of cool. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. So they take kids from the back from the poor cart and have them work internally in the engine because they have to move things around because parts are missing. If they don't, everyone, all human life dies.  So they literally go in the back and they take children away from their families who scream and reject this. In Battlestar, they had children who are also taken for a similar reason to work. You had people who had no choice but to work on the fuel processing ship. Otherwise, all of you anyway wiped out one I've often thought about. You know, I'm a huge fan of Star Trek The Next Generation. How do we get to a post capitalism world where we still have incentives, but where, you know, post scarcity?  The problem is it as we're in transition, there will be jobs that are essential, which means one of one of the glimpses we get. I understand a pandemic is different, but we still see a glimpse of people who have to work, you know, kind of low skill, boring, tedious jobs like a grocery store, while other people who have higher skill jobs are getting their their needs met by the government, at least in terms of the cash.  So we're we're here telling, you know, these people we're talking about right now. Right? Right. So, again, I understand it's a pandemic. It's very specific, but we're getting a glimpse of what happens when some people are told your job is not essential. So we're going to guarantee your food and resources for the time being.  You are really doing that, though. It's not just as effective. I'm just I'm just saying that as we move towards automation, there will still be jobs that are essential. What do we do? How do we, you know, incentivize and compensate, make that worth the people who have no choice but to keep working while the rest of us don't?  I don't know if it's a keep working while the rest of us don't issue. I think it's a problem of jobs being phased out. I think the real problem is automation is going to phase out jobs. It's not going to be about what's essential and what's not essential. I think you're sort of applying pandemic vernacular to well, let's let's let's remove the pandemic from it.  And let's say, you know, right now, one of the things I looked at and we talk about this a little bit before I met a homeless guy in Chicago and he worked at a job that became obsolete, I I'll sit back.  Yes. I asked a homeless guy how he became homeless when I was when I was like 19. And he told me that he had a job. He worked there for 20, 30 years. As he got older, his family, you know, moved away, lost contact. These are different times. Some friends and family had died when his company became obsolete. Technology didn't matter anymore. He was cast out. You know, he had nobody to work anymore.  And his expertise was very specific. So he got a severance package that ran out. He got unemployment that ran out. He got kicked out.  Now he's homeless. I look at that and I say, how do we make sure that doesn't happen? This guy should not be punished simply because times have changed. But if you scale that up, you know, and say it keeps happening in every different sector, eventually you'll end up with 90 percent of the population saying my needs will be taken care of and 10 percent saying I still have to work. Whatever the industry may be like, that's a transitional period is going to be very difficult.  We automate most. Jobs, except for some some people will still have to work. Does anybody really think we to automate most jobs, though? I mean, there's so many jobs that can't be automated.  I don't think that can be the I mean, you're talking about some weird sort of futuristic version. Yeah, I don't think that's what we need to be concerned with. I think I think the idea of universal basic income is wonderful. The idea that your your needs are taken care of in terms of food and housing and then everything else you've got to do on your own. If we're looking at when we look at struggle, right. We look at struggle across the board, can't feed yourself, can't put a roof over your head, can't would if this is what was attractive.  But universal basic income to me would if we all agreed that some semblance of dignity is a part of being an American. And then we will provide you with food, we provide you with housing, everything else you have to fucking earn. And that's interesting. That's interesting. I like that. I like it. But I don't know.  People don't work well when they don't have to.  Exactly. When people don't have an incentive and the competition is important. And when you look at people that are anticapitalist and they're really into socialism, one of the things you find is a lot of rich kids. So it's weird, right?  It's fucking very real weird. It's because they don't understand real struggle because they've grown up without it. And they have these ideals like they feel guilty because they've grown up without struggle and they want to help the world and they think capitalism is evil. And I never saw my dad. So we need to we need to get all these rich people to give that money to all these poor people.  We need to balance out income, you know, or else they notice the people around them were all white. The people that are into socialism, the people that are in socialism, tend to be upper class, upper middle class, obviously white generalizing in a big way. A lot.  But there's there's some studies, some research that came out that finds the overwhelming majority of the socialists in the United States. Yeah.  You know, they came from upper middle class, upper class families that tended to be white. Yeah.  And those are the ones that focus so hard on these social justice warrior issues. You take a person who's been surrounded by rich white people. Yes. It probably got a reason to not like them, but then they assume all white people are the same and you end up seeing this racialization of politics.  Also, they find themselves in a position of affluence that they didn't earn and they want to burn it all the ground, you know, and they assume, you know, I think there's some truth in that, you know, that there's people who have money they didn't earn and they're leeches on the system. They make money from money. They've never done anything in their life. Sure. They're arrogant. Sure. There's a lot of people like that. Right.  But, you know, when you don't take that generalization and apply it to anyone who has money or everyone and you take it to a dark place.  Exactly.  When I when I first started, you know, entering the public space in terms of news and politics as an Occupy Wall Street, and before I had any notoriety, I was being heralded.  They called me a good example of what's wrong with the system. Here's Tim Poole, a high school dropout, mixed race guy. And here he is just sleeping in a dirt park using his phone to tell the real stories of the world. After I got featured in Time magazine. What do they say? Temple is white and he was born with a silver spoon, which is not true, is absolutely not true.  But the the socialist types, the activists couldn't accept that I had, you know, jumped the class system. I guess their view of the world is rigid, that the rich people keep the poor down. There's no chance for upward mobility. And that's not the case. You know, you absolutely can become successful from, you know, humble means.  One of my favorite quotes was her talking about it's literally impossible to pull yourself up by your bootstraps when she used to be a waitress and now she's a congresswoman.  Like, she can't look, it's not impossible, but it's not even that's what we need to address. It's not even the reality is some people have a far easier path and some people have a far more difficult path. It's just these are this is just but you have to deal with the hand you're given if life is a game. And while I'm not saying it's a game, it is life, but it's similar to a game in that you're dealt a set of cards, you're dealt a set of circumstances.  And yes, some people just get four aces from birth. Your dad's a multi billionaire and your whole family's always been rich. And you never have to worry about a God thing for the rest of your life. But guess what? Those people turn out to be fucking miserable and crazy. There's some benefit in being born with a shitty hand of cards. Absolutely. There really is a motivational benefit for sure. Gumption.  You know, there's a there's a TED talk. There's one one trait, one personality trait that guarantees success of all of it's not intelligence, it's not class, not race, not gender. You know, this what perseverance. That's it. I believe this is a TED talk on it. It's interesting and it's true now. I think there is there's always going to be certain limits based on your ability. Like, I'm never going to play in the NBA.  Right. Tall enough, right. Nowhere near as fast I can jump high enough. Actually, that's not true. I can jump. Right. I skateboard. But you take people.  Who? Don't have top tier intelligence, not the strongest, but if they work hard enough, they can find their their APACS, they can find that point where they are successful and they can make it right. It's not true for everybody. Some people are below that. That threshold, no matter how hard they try, they're going to need help.  Well, I think that the problem is with any sort of generalization, you know, perseverance is the most important thing. Yes, sure. But you also have to be intelligent. You can't be doing the same thing over and over again.  No, I'm not going to quit because no, you have to be able to figure out what you're doing wrong as well as have perseverance. Perseverance is a necessary part of the equation, but there's many pieces to that question.  But define success in that regard, right? If successes. Well, it depends on the field you're choosing, right? If you're not smart enough to be an astrophysicist, you shouldn't be an astrophysicist. Right. You're not tall enough to play in the NBA. You probably can't play. I mean, do you think you still be true, though? Muggsy Bozz. That did was amazing.  He was amazing. Was five seven was he is 60 is amazing. Well the five five five three five three. Oh. Spud Webb. That's right. Wow.  You're shorter than I thought. Yeah. But you can do it. Yeah. That's amazing. It's very rare. Right. We talked about two guys. Right. To exactly. Exactly like that. Yeah.  I think the average person has the potential and capabilities of being successful, wealthy and if they want famous, I think one of the one of the challenges we have in our culture is how we're raising kids and what we're what the values we're giving them.  Well, it's also what are you trying to do? Like what do you look? There's a thing there's a bunch of different things that you could just you just don't have.  Like, some people can't sing. They don't want your fucking talent. They just don't have it. The voice sounds like shit, but guess who else is voice sound like shit. Bob Dylan. Terrible voice.  Yeah. How does it feel? Come on, man. People love it because there's like authenticity and passion and there's something to it. But he found out a way to make it work. He wouldn't win American Idol fuck no matter what his music.  One of the greatest musicians.  I really imagine him going like someone saying, what do you want to do, man? I want to be a singer songwriter, OK? Just without any music or any interest, sing me a song. Probably.  Probably. Well, you know, there's there there are a lot of people, especially in the Internet day and age, that you would not expect to have made it. Who made it? Yes.  Know. Well, you know, there's a lot. Yeah. I mean, and then there's rules today that I don't think really hold true. You know, people say, oh, you know, you have to be good looking.  You have to be thin. Well, Adele's not thin.  She is now. She's thin now. People are mad at her for being funny, but she just was talented.  You said a powerful voice or that woman, Susan, what was her name that was on America's Got Talent? I don't know. What was America's Got Talent when X Factor.  X Factor actress Susan Boyle, that fucking wizard over here, Susan Boyle, she looked like someone's Grammy, right. But she belted out the song that made Simon Cowell almost cry. Wow.  Because she she's just fucking talented, really good. You can find the thing. But, you know, if you're Susan Boyle and you want to be a comedian, maybe her jokes are fucking terrible. Maybe she would show up at open mic night. It's Sunday night at the Comedy Store over and over again and keep bombing. And then, you know, she never would have made it.  Yeah, I can't learn. Some people use it. I think I think if you can if you can learn. Right. If you can you know, one of the problems those people refuse to accept when they're wrong, they should be self-critical.  Yeah. They're not they don't have an analytical perspective in terms of their own issues.  They can't analyze themselves and see the flaws and be objective and introspective. Some people just don't have that because they've been protecting themselves. They have these sort of personality traits to protect themselves from self deprecation, from understanding where they're flawed.  When I was a teenager, I remember reading that Michael Jordan would watch tapes of himself playing to figure out what he did wrong. I know that's true. But to me, that was like. If you want to be the best, like guess you need to actively look for what you're screwing up, call out immediately. Well, that's imperative for sparring when you're sparring like we used to film a lot of back when I was competing with film sparring sessions and fights, particular fights, but sparring sessions, it was critical because you could see how you were telegraphing something and then you got countered.  You could see how and sometimes you don't think you're doing it, but then you realize, oh, my God, I'm dropping my hand every time I do this.  And then you get caught crazy. Yeah. That's with everything that's like poker.  Yeah. Yeah. Giving your tells away and it's nuts. But I think most things you'd be better off seeing like with comedy. It's massive, it's gigantic.  Cumulative visually. See yourself is like primary. That's number one.  A little bit, a little bit less good is listening to yourself. And at a certain point in time in your career, you can get away with just listening in terms of like. But there's a big difference between people who monitor their stuff and go over it and analyze it versus people who don't. And it's just it's it's accelerated learning. It's like taking advantage of all the tools that you're given. And you can apply that to anything that you're trying to do good in life if you have the time and the energy, if you're doing a job.  And during this job, you know, you just show up at work and you try to do your best and you go home, you fuck off and you do your stuff. You'll get better at whatever you do. Exactly.  But if you go and do your job and then afterwards analyze what you did, pay attention to it, write things down, make a diary perhaps, or review your work and you'll get better, faster.  It's a matter of how much time? As long as you don't burn out.  I don't take days off ever. Yeah, that's weird.  I took a day off yesterday, had some bad sushi. I had a lesson. Everybody, if if I don't want to be mean to the sushi people, they were really nice to me. But you know, maybe, maybe lay-off sushi if they've been close for a month because of pandemic and well, you drive in from the other side of the country.  Text me, I'll tell you the place. There's only I go to like four places out here for sushi and everywhere else I'm like, oh yeah, no.  Well, so here's what I want to say. Right. I don't take a day off and a lot of people say I'm crazy and I've actually my Monday through Friday is now double shifts every day on Saturday and Sunday are single shifts in terms of production. So I do Monday through Friday, three hours and 40 minutes, about Saturday and Sunday is about an hour and 40 minutes. And and what would I do if I wasn't working?  I'd be playing video games.  But listen to the numbers you just said. Yeah, three hours and forty Monday through Friday. Yeah.  And then an hour and a half per weekend day. Yeah. That's still not a full day's work.  That's still not a week's worth.  So average person, an hour and a half of recording is like ten hours of research.  Oh yeah. Well I'm working more so it's like eight hours. So I'm doing constant research in between fact checking. And then I like once I get everything in line and I think I'm confident on what, what, you know, what I have. And of course I'm I'm not perfect. Then I record for about twenty minutes, then I get back to researching, reading and I, you know, so it's it's there's another benefit though.  You work for yourself. Absolutely. You don't have some dickhead over your shoulder telling you what to do. I chose this though.  Right. So so the couple of things when you brought up, you get good at whatever you whatever as you do. I tell my friends every second you spend doing something as an investment into being better than better at that. So if you want to come home from work and play video games all day, you'll be really good at video games, man. Maybe start a stream, you twitch channel, maybe maybe you can make some money being a good personality, but you got to earn it.  Or maybe there's something you want to do that instead of playing video games, you do that instead. For me, when I'm not working, I'm just sitting around like, why am I not working? What like what am I doing? You know, I'm it's I ended up taking yesterday off. I didn't work today because we're doing the show. And so I'm sitting, you know, sitting around watching TV shows like this is awful. I can't stand I got to read the news, man.  I got I got to I got to be into it.  Well, you're driven. Yeah. But also you're enjoying it. That's the difference between someone who's working in a fucking coal mine or someone who's working in a field all day picking strawberries.  Yeah, I hate the job. I hear you. But you know how many people have hit me up? You pocket something similar, like how do I do what you do?  You know, when I was working for Vice and I was traveling around the world. 10, 20 emails every week from young people saying, I really want to do what you do and you know what? You know what they would say to me when I tell them how to do it? They would say, I would never do that.  I would tell them, here's what you do. Do you have any money saved up? No. OK, where do you work? You don't work. Get a job, Starbucks, McDonalds, whatever you can get. Maybe you can do better than that. Save your money. Once you've saved enough to find a store you want, fly there, cover it. They would say no, I had one.  There's one person that said to me, I want to travel around the world and do what you do. How do I do it? I say, do you have money saved up? Yes. Excellent. There's a story right now going on in Turkey.  All right. You got to be secure. You got to be safe, but assembles fairly. OK, fly there right now. Film it. And, you know, I'll see if I can make any connections on what you find. They said, well, the money I saved is for my apartment in Brooklyn. And I'm like, right. What's more important to you, having your nice Williamsburg apartment or being a journalist traveling around the world? Well, I like my apartment.  I'm like, OK, listen, when I worked for Vice, I was sleeping on a couch. Every dime they paid me, I put in the bank. I didn't touch it. I got a job working for a Disney and ABC News joint venture company. After that, they paid me a bunch of money. I put 70 percent in the bank. I didn't touch it. When I left. I went to a bunch of these New York digital companies.  You know, I'll spare them their names for any embarrassment, many of them who have become rather worthless. They still exist and they're big. And I decided after seeing what they had to offer, the bias, the deception, the click bait driven nature of it to myself. And because I saved my money every step of the way, I was able to do so. So then I had an apartment. Then I could pay for my plane ticket, you know, to to Sweden, to France, to Germany to do these stories and started building up a base within about seven or eight months.  I had gone from red to black. So now all of a sudden I was no longer losing money. I was making money. And I'm like, oh, there it is.  A couple of years on. Ridiculous, ridiculous. It's ridiculously successful for myself. I guess I could you know, it's relative, but I've got several employees launching new companies. Well, one of the companies shattered a fundraising record of a million bucks in a single day. So that's that's the path for me is in the path of everybody but sacrifice, you know?  Well, you're basically saying exactly what they're saying. And Ted, talk, perseverance. And you you embrace the grind.  But it's also what do you really prioritize? Yeah. For me, what are you trying to do? I don't care about having an apartment. I want to.  I want to. I want to see what was going on the ground in Istanbul.  So, you know, it's also like who who is the type of person that would chase down the stories? The type of person is really going to chase down the stories. The person is driven to chase down stories. What you're getting is questions from idiots. You're getting questions from people like how do I do it? And then when you offer the answer, I'm not going to do that. Those are the people that are never going to make it.  A conversation I had with Ari Shapiro, where he and Robert Kelley, apparently they they thought about sponsoring a comic who's up and coming, taking care of their financial needs and, you know, for like a year and a try to see how far they could get in their career if they didn't have to deal with money. And I said that's the problem, is the type of person who's going to make it is going to make it not just in spite of the fact that they don't have any money, but because of the fact they don't have any money in those day jobs, those sucky jobs that you need to have when you're struggling, those they fucking motivate you.  They're important. If somebody just comes along and gives you all the money you need for food, you're going to have Fassett and some hungry guy on the other side of town is going to take all the gigs that you would get. They're going to write better jokes. They're going to be more motivated to go to open mikes.  They're going to pound the pavement harder. Well, I got a story for you. I'll try to get the details right. My my buddy's company. So forgive me if I'm if I'm getting details wrong, but he had a social media management company. He started himself. He knew everything about social media, Instagram and all that. And he started building up a client base where I'm going to run your social media for you worked like a charm. So I making a ton of money, get new contracts.  These companies know what they were doing. He got to a point where I had to hire people. He ended up hiring a couple of college grads and he put up the ad saying, you know, college degree required. They couldn't figure anything out. They kept calling them having problems, couldn't manage anything. So he fired them, rehired again. More college grads, same problem, eventually has to fire him. Then he hires because he's running out of money he hires to high school.  I think they were high school dropouts and it was like they wanted substantially less money. And at this point, I just couldn't find good people. They worked swimmingly. It was amazing. No phone calls, no problems. These were people who had worked hard, saved up money in their small bumpkin hometown, moved to Los Angeles to make it big. They knew what they wanted. They knew what they had to do, and they said, I will find a way to do it.  He said the other people are hiring. We're just like drones. They just wanted a job. They didn't know or care what they were doing. They didn't bother, so didn't want to learn. But these people who are driven viewed this as just another problem to be solved on my path to success. Yeah, that's that's the mindset and that's the difference, the mindset of success is the mindset of I will figure it out.  So I think the problem is how we're raising people in this country. We're raising them to in certain areas to expect things to be given to you. You get a participation trophy no matter what you do, you congratulations.  This is the problem with socialism and this is the problem with universal basic income, what we're talking about. Yeah, yeah. You're expecting something from the government, particularly without any financial feasibility. There's no there's no real logic to where that money comes from.  OK, show me your work is what is money, you know, so so one of the arguments I keep seeing from a lot of people who have more I don't want to call them socialists. I think they're just regular urban dwelling like liberal left type people.  There's one viral post on on Reddit, on Reddit that said you've got these conservatives or you've got these people out protesting so they can enrich their landlords and these billionaires when they should be demanding that rent be waived, that mortgages, you know, in evictions be cancelled and that the government take care of their needs and provide them with stimulus or something like that.  And I look at that like you're very clearly living in a city. But what they don't understand is they say things like, you know, landlord isn't a job. Like I argue that there's a lot of very successful landlords who make a ton of money and do very little.  But it's a fucking job, right? It's so stupid to say it's not a job. It's not just that. It's the money you pay in rent can't just be wiped out because there's groundskeepers, there's maintenance, there's administrative assistants, there's taxes that be filed. Rent doesn't just go into their pocket so they can buy a boat, but they view it this way and they think that money is is what you want, that when they say these people who want the government to be reopened are simply trying to enrich the wealthy.  It's like I think maybe they make things and they want to keep making things they want they want in the economy, not the government.  The economy. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. Mixing that up.  But there's there there are a lot of people that don't seem to understand. I think it's because when you live in a city, everything's already there for you. When I lived in New York, the Williamsburg Bridge, boom, there it is. I didn't see it built. I didn't pay a dime for it. And I can just use it. I can cross over. It's just there. And I've never had to, you know, you never had to fight for it.  So you just say, why can't I just have it? You see, you walk in any store and there's food. Hey, there's food. Easy. What they don't see is the supply chain where the food is made, the work that goes into it. So they assume that money guarantees access to it, which it doesn't. If the economy is shut down, the money can't buy you things. The value of that money starts going down. If the farms can't sell any of this to anybody and start dumping and I think it's called fallowing fields no longer farming, then there's nothing to buy.  So if products aren't being made and services aren't being rendered because the economy is closed, what is your money going to get you at a certain point when the economy is shut down for too long and we're seeing all of these businesses close family businesses? I heard a story, a terrible tragedy. Somebody killed themselves because their family business of seven years was shut down, that that product is gone. So eventually there's no food to buy. And only then will people realize that the government stimulus money has no inherent value.  It's the work we do for each other. That's the argument being left out when you when you get a biased view on social media or when these people don't quite understand, you know, that's the problem.  There's a lot of noise. People that don't quite understand, people that aren't a part of the supply chain that really don't know what it's like to like the people that raise food.  They're freaking out right now, you know, people that raise cattle and the people that grow food in the fact that they have to deal with being shut down and trying to figure out how to restart things. And when is it going to be OK to restart things? When is it? And what if it happens again, if there's another flare up two months from now? I mean, they're hurting right now and they might take years to recover from these past couple of months.  Well, there was, I think, some health official in California saying they might not be able to fully reopen until is a vaccine, which could take eighteen months, fully reopened.  What, like to go back to normal? Right.  So I think there was an MIT technology review article talking about how we may have to do intermittent lockdowns, you know, like two months lockdown, one month off until the vaccine is available. Then there was another another study came out saying something similar.  What about herd immunity? I mean, sweeden, they think they're they're on target for the end of May to have herd immunity, which is like sixty percent, I think.  Yeah, the information keeps changing. You know, we're learning more. So maybe these statements are at this point now obsolete.  Yeah, Sweden's a weird place, too, because it's a it's consists mostly of little villages.  Sweden. Yes. I mean, big cities.  Well you have Stockholm but primarily the population is sort of it's it's separated by these smaller towns. It's not. You're right.  Or you have already been tested for the covid. Are you really worried about you right now? If people are weird about CofS now, you know, it's totally I inhaled water.  The cops are nerve wracking for folks.  Oh, that's brutal. All right. Yeah, you gave me this bottle of water and I held it just messed me up. You OK? Yeah, thanks. So you give me, you know, relax, calm down.  Just just breathe. Whisper. No, it's OK. I got to go. You gave me the test.  No, no. covid-19. Yeah, your your voice sounds terrible right now. I just inhaled water. How did you inhale it. I don't know. I was trying to drink it and I nailed it. Happens now. I sound weird, right? Yeah.  You sound like a different person. Did the luminol secret just replace me with somebody else?  Yeah. You're too controversial. All that shit you were saying to random people up. All right. I think I'm better. I won't I won't inhale the water. It feels weird.  Kyle Collins gave me something today. I wanted you to see Jamie. It's something there's some shit going down with UFO sightings. Oh, yeah. Yeah, I've been there before.  Yeah, but they were new. Yeah. I'll send I'll send it to you. I've been following this stuff. Yeah. It's.  Hold on a second, Jamie. All right, I just texted it to Pentagon officially releases UFO, this is the tweet. It says, New Pentagon formally released three mysterious UFO videos captured by Navy pilots.  The already leaked video showed what DOD insists on calling unidentified aerial phenomena moving at incredible speeds and performing near impossible maneuvers.  This is a weird subject because it's one of those subjects where people automatically dismiss it because it's been it's been so touted by kooks. There's so many wacky fucks that have talked about UFOs that anybody talking about UFOs has to be out of their fucking mind.  But then when you see these videos and you see them performing these impossible tasks like these, these things are moving in a way that we've never seen anything move before, flipping upside down and sideways, moving at insane rates of speed like they don't know what these are.  Yeah, you know, phenomena.  What's interesting, though, is I was reading one of these stories and they passively mentioned that the sighting was near a technology, a U.S. naval like technology station of some sort and like a top secret development.  And I'm like that could be one of two things. Either it's developed by the people that are at that base or they're monitoring the people that are at that base. These aircraft, we call them aircraft, are displaying characteristics that are not currently within the U.S. inventory, nor any foreign inventory that we are aware of. Maybe they see this shit that's going down with China and all the ships being moved in, like, listen, you fuckheads the aliens.  Yeah, we would listen, you fucking moron. Territorial apes.  I'd like to think that. But you don't think so. Manhattan Project, man. I mean, the US has probably got some crazy motherfucking weapons. It could be.  But the Manhattan Project was also coincidentally, right after they started detonating bombs and the aliens started showing up. That's what they think, right?  Yeah, well, that was when the bulk of U.S. sightings started jumping.  And worldwide, I believe, to you know, maybe we've slowly been getting more and more information about this.  I've been actually reading a lot of these stories of the past several months, more admissions from government, more release of documents and more sightings.  So there's been a big I don't want to call it. Well, a lot of people murmuring that April was going to be the month when we finally learn the truth. APR's almost up.  It's almost almost up. We've got a few days and twenty seventh. You know what? I use more days.  Do you know thirty, you know, by what happened, you know, at the O'Hare Airport sighting, which one's out. So this was I think in like 06 at Chicago's International O'Hare, a UFO came down and hovered above. I think it was which terminal it was. It hovered for a few minutes I think, and then shot straight, punched a hole in the clouds. Everybody saw it happen. Now, I had just quit working at O'Hare around the time when the sighting happened, so I had friends who were still there.  I had a friend tell me that when this UFO came down, people on Manheim Road, where which is the road on the side of O'Hare, got out of their cars, like just stopped. The light got up and we're looking and staring at it and that the people who are working where we worked, we worked for American Eagle Airlines, walked out of the room and we're just staring at it float and then shoot up and punch a hole in the clouds.  You know, they said weather phenomenon. So there's a photo of it.  A pilot took a photo of it. This is back when like very early phone camera. So it's a very grainy, awful picture.  There it is right there. That's that's not it. No, no, that's super fake. I think I know these are all people trying to fake. It's really hard to find that one is not that one might be it, but I don't think so.  It it barely looks like cargo o'haire UFO sightings 2006. So that right there, I do not believe those are at now. So we'll click on that article, see what it says.  Jamie, some blog that one might be on the left, but so many people try exploiting the stuff for four clicks and four reviews and they make these fake photos and it was links not working.  I'm click on a few times. It was a very, very faint photo from the from the cockpit. It might be that one right there in the middle. And so on the left side, far left, it might be that way. No, no, that's not it. That's not it. Well, there was a really crappy photo of it, and that might be it. That might be it was a really it was out of the cockpit of a window.  A pilot took a photo. And, you know, I wonder where of all the sightings gone since phones became ubiquitous.  I mean, this a simple, you know, I guess excuse the aliens. They're sentient. They know we have phones. They're like, OK, stop, you know, the cloaking or whatever. But I want or I wonder if, you know why there were so many UFOs in and around the time cell phone cameras come out, they're gone.  Well, I think most people are full of shit. Yeah, yeah. I think most people like to pretend they see things. They don't really see things. But, you know, I don't think that excludes the possibility.  It's not like it's like it's these things are mutually exclusive.  Like people are full of shit, therefore aliens don't exist. I think aliens could be real and people are full of shit.  And I think that it could be it's very rare that they visit us.  But if they do it like, well, how often do scientists go to the Congo to study chimps? I mean, how many people do they send let the bottom of the ocean to look for new life forms? How rare is it?  Let me trip you out on that idea. We put decoys up for animals. Animals can't tell the difference. What if you've actually met a decoy person? You can tell the difference.  Maybe it's you, bro. Maybe it's me. That's right. And that's why you're able to work so much. Oh, yeah. Robot, you don't get tired now.  So you're interested in news and disseminating factual evidence because we're actually doing is collecting a database for the for the aliens now.  But I thought about this because I saw a photo on Reddit of a puffin, I think it's called the bird and they put up a fake puffin. And it's because I think they're called puffins. It's because the birds don't like, you know, nesting in places where they're alone. And so I put in the decoy there. The other birds would start coming and like one bird showed up and was hanging out with the decoy. I'm like, could you imagine?  Like, you see, like we put duck decoys in the water, we do duck calls and the ducks like fly, honey, I'm going to come over, I check this out and like a woodblock, could you imagine, like seeing like a beautiful woman or someone you're attracted to and being like, oh, look at that. It's really like an alien decoy just to, like, probe you and like, better understand you or something.  Well, the decoy, just a term decoys. Weird because decoys are used for hunting like turkey. It's turkey season right now. Yeah. And the way that most guys hunt for turkeys, they take a rubber turkey. You put that fucker out in the middle of the field and then you hide behind a bush with a shotgun.  And then Turkey's like here and they come over and they try to get some pussy and then they get shot.  So what if, you know, you see some dude and or like you see it for you, you know, be a woman, you won't get that pussy, you know? And then she's going like, hey, hey, come over here.  And you're like, oh, hey, me. And then I get eaten. No, no, they just, you know, take it in the ship, probably in front of you.  But this is the thing about putting things up your butt.  Most doctors don't even do that like they have Aymaras now, aliens need to probe you and your ass. I think it's just what everyone's afraid of. They're afraid of things going their ass. So that's what they think is going to happen. If the aliens get them, they're going to freeze me. Somebody somebody told a dumb story back in the day and it was the most sensational version.  Everybody had to have it.  So they were like, that's what they went with, you know, maybe or maybe they do that to keep you keep your mouth shut. The fuck you in the ass to see. Keep your mouth shut.  Or some dude actually got abducted, right? Yeah.  And he comes back and he's like they think they won against me. I think they beat me. They put stuff at my butt. They're weirdos.  Do you think the story of Betty and Barney Hill now, it's the very first UFO abduction story. It's an ancient story. And what's crazy is Angela Hill, who's a UFC fighter. I had her on the podcast. And after the show, she told me her grandpa was Barney Hill. Whoa.  And I was like, holy fuck. Like, we forgot we didn't talk about it during the show, but she wanted to bring it up because she knows I'm kind of obsessed with UFOs. But the account that they have, they get hypnotized. And he's recalling the abduction and they have like the same story. It's very terrifying. You hear him crying and screaming and you know that he was taken aboard this craft and examined and brought back and the missing time.  But here's the thing. If they only did that occasionally, they only came down once every few years and just scoop some person up in the middle of some rural place, like if you're flying over, you know, I think their instance was in I believe it was in Maine. If you're flying over somewhere like Maine, which is a very low population state, and you see a lone car and it's just traveling along the highway.  And there's places in Maine where you go from, like Portland to Bangor when you're traveling on that road, it's like sixty miles with nothing, not a gas station, nothing. If you were an alien, you saw a car by itself like no other car move in. We got one.  Isn't it just easier to think it's the US government? No. Why not? Because we don't have the capability of doing something like that. I don't think I don't think the capability of the scientists working for the government.  Is any different than the capability, the science scientists that are working for, you know, Project X or, you know, fill in the blanks in terms of like what Raytheon publicly traded companies, how long look it quadcopter don't seem all that complicated to me.  Quadcopter? Yeah, like a helicopter. Like drones. You know, we've seen a lot of toys you buy. They got four propellers.  Take take that concept, use thinner, you know, jets and surround it in a desk so that it's, you know, universally like it can move in any direction because it's got, you know, because it's a power source.  Whereas the gas tank.  Well, lithium ion battery. Aw, come on man.  You're talking space. Shit like this is stuff hasn't even been invented yet. Think about how little mileage you can get out of a Tesla. You know, they had is not as advanced as Tesla is.  You know, still when it's going full out, it can only go for I mean, you get three hundred seven miles if you drive a grandma.  But if you drive like a maniac, you don't even you'd have that, you know, that they I could be wrong with this, but I'm pretty sure that they had this flying platform in the 70s that uses gas power.  And they've also had jet gas for a long time now. They've sort of they've had jet packs that are capable of going for like 30 seconds. They don't.  I've experienced it. I'm pretty sure the jet packs back in the day went for a long time. No, no, they definitely didn't. We can look it up. Yeah, let's look it up, because I did the whole thing was the fact they were burning gas and to propel you in the air, they only had a certain amount.  I thought I was like, twenty minutes, twenty, thirty minutes maybe. Now my understanding of why we abandon jet pack technology was that it was inefficient and heavy and you couldn't carry it without it being turned on. So they opted for larger, like, you know, like what are they called Chinooks. Helicopters that can carry multiple people, multiple people at once. When you're wearing a jetpack, it has to be on idle, negating its own weight, which means it's burning as you're walking around, which means you get a good twenty minute jump and you got to abandon the tech and you don't want your enemies to get it.  Have you ever seen a guy fly a jetpack? Yeah. Yes. A video on YouTube. No, I mean in real life.  Oh, I've seen that one guy, the Iron Man. Dude, I'm real. I've been there and real. My friend will be from in Denver on the radio. He had a radio show in the morning HD radio show. He still has a radio show shout out to Willie. And he had this guy who was a jetpack pilot who came in and in the parking lot of the radio studio.  And, you know, fans of the radio show came and did it, too, and and watched it, rather. And this guy flew in the air for about 15, 20 seconds and then landed. This guy was so banged up, both of his legs were blown apart. He had he had big braces on both of his knees.  I'm like, what happen to your knees? He's like, just crash landing. Both my knees are blown to shit. Had no ACLs and neither one of his knees.  But that's what I'm saying. It's good that this is back then.  Good for about 30 seconds, 30 seconds of flying.  Well, so the point I'm trying to get to is if you take something like a quadcopter, you could absolutely feel it with with, you know, gas or being loud as fuck.  But it would it would depending on how you would be an engine. It'd be an engine. It'd be loud as fuck.  And you'd hear from the from the quadrotor.  Yeah. But these what these people are describing is nothing like that. These people are describing things that are silent, that go from zero to a thousand miles an hour in a split second, the things that defy physics as we understand them, this is not something that I think that the U.S. government has.  I don't I just if you look at like, OK, like Elon Musk's company, Project X or SpaceX, SpaceX is right now one of the premier civilian companies, private companies that's making rocket ships. They fuck up all the time. They're in the middle of innovating all the time. He's one of the smartest people on Earth. He's one of the in terms of technology. He's he knows as much about propulsion as anyone. And they still can't get it right.  They're still trying to figure it out. They're trying to come up with something that could be viable in terms of commercial space flight. And they're working on it daily. And these these people with the brightest minds we know of right now, they're in this jet propulsion space travel business. There's, you know, Virgin's working on something is a couple other companies that are working on things as well. And then you have NASA, which worked the best they could come up with was the space shuttle.  Right. Do you think that there is something way better than space shuttle that just never used that they had and they they kept it on the back burner, didn't want to let anybody know. But the way they would use it is they would pick people up in a race, their memory and horn with their asshole.  That's crazy. Well, that's less likely than the hundreds of billions of galaxies just in our own in our own known universe. Right.  Each one with hundreds of billions of stars, each star with who knows how many fucking planets. That's somewhere out there that something more advanced than us. Maybe a thousand years, maybe a million years. But it's figured out how to come here. I got same question.  Then why hasn't why hasn't anyone discovered them? Why is Setti. Failed search for search for extraterrestrial intelligence, why haven't the chimps invented guns? They've started using more tools, but. Right.  Why haven't they invented guns, though? So why hasn't said he found UFOs the same fucking answer. They're not advanced enough yet. It's a real simple answer. The industrial age is pretty fucking recent, right? I mean, think about when people invented cars. You're talking about eighteen hundred. That's really recent.  And we've only flights between hundreds of high power.  Radio transmission is only in the past 100 years or so.  Right. Well, you saw you've seen the movie Contact. Maybe that's the old one, right? It's Jodie Foster and Matthew McConaughey. It's based on Carl Sagan's book about contact with space and with aliens.  It's going to go down. I think I did see it recently. Interesting. Interesting take on it. But. Oh, yeah.  Is that they've received the signal that we sent out way, way back, you know, in the day actually when the the first broadcast signal was Hitler announcing the Olympic Games, the start of the Berlin Games, and this was the first signal they got is a really controversial moment in the movie or controversy, you know, in the plot with that, once they were trying to decipher the image that was being sent, they realized it was Hitler.  Yeah. The first thing they see is a swastika and the what the fuck is this? Send it back to us. And then they had to realize, oh, no, no, no.  This is the first image that we sent out to space. They wouldn't be able to understand the political or historical context of this.  And so so I got a few there's a few issues I see in terms of aliens and earth contact. Right.  We are substantially more connected, you know, in an evolutionary chain to ants than we are to any alien. So we can't communicate with them. For the most part. We kind of can we understand how they communicate.  But when an ant sees a superhighway, there's something this is someone else's quote. They don't think twice. So it's possible there are aliens that have superhighways right above us. We can't tell what it is, same as a dog doesn't understand other than statement. But one of the one of the issues I think is often neglected in the conversation about aliens is the we assume aliens would be on a very similar planet to us. We assume that they would have some kind of atmosphere.  Perhaps it's a liquid atmosphere. And one of the things that I would ask of a researcher, because I'm not the expert, is the fact that we have the proper balance of oxygen, the atmosphere to manipulate fire, which allows us to, you know, separate elements and then create computers and components and fuels wouldn't exist on a planet without the same, you know, atmosphere we exist today. Stop.  I can't answer that, really. There's no known propulsion system for any of these crafts. These things are not using fire. They don't have a heat signal. They don't know what they are. They don't know how that work.  I don't mean propulsion. I mean the separation of elements. The manipulation of elements. Right. So we we melt things and separate them and break them down. They don't believe that that's how it works now.  But I mean, like, how do you even start from. I'm sure there's an answer.  You know, let's say you have a species that lives on a planet with no oxygen, has no access to fire. What energy like what dense energy source do they have that will allow them to manipulate matter?  Do you know the rules are the bizarre story? I do, yeah. Well, one of the things that he talked about when he first stopped working for areas for and the government was tapping his phones and, you know, there's there's a lot that can be documented about him. There's a lot that can't be. But one of the things that he talked about was a thing called element 115. That element 115 is insanely dense element that they use to bend gravity and that the way he described the way the propulsion system works, it's like putting a bowling ball in the center of a very soft mattress and that all of the other mattress, all the rest of the mattress, the mattress bends around the intense mass of the bowling ball, and that this is how these incredibly advanced aliens from this other planet use.  This is their propulsion system that was used from Star Trek, though the the concept of warp was around for a really long I think the concept is based on Einstein's theory of gravity.  I mean, this is the whole idea. If you could find something that could do that. But here's the thing. When Bob Lazaar talked about this in the late 80s, early 90s, this element didn't exist. Right now it does. It wasn't it wasn't proven until they did it in a particle collider. I believe it is 2013. And it was talking about this element far before it was it was Enys.  Apparently, this is the big rumor.  He apparently had taken some of that from a lab and through George Noory and it was a George Noory.  Yes, they did some experiments on on television and showed that this stuff had made light and fog banned in a way that they couldn't describe.  He also then he also claimed to see a small alien creature on his way out. He said he saw something that was sitting down, but he doesn't know if it was a model that they were using, like if they had created something that was supposed to be the size of a thing that could fit. In these crafts, because these crafts, he said, were designed for things that were far smaller than human beings. I'm pretty sure in the initial interview he gave when he went public was that he saw an alien and then later on changed it, saying, I don't know if it was maybe a model or a puppet.  Yeah, he said he thought he saw something sitting down and two people standing over it, looking at it. He said he thought he saw an alien, you know, but he's probably I mean, I don't know.  I mean, look, he said it was literally for like a half a second, like he's walking by a window and he sees something inside of it. Imagine being a guy who's in your 20s and you're a propulsion expert. And it's been proven that he worked at Los Alamos Labs and it's been proven that he did put a fucking jet engine.  Yeah, it's been proven that he did put a jet engine on a Honda. I mean, he's a genius, is it? And then you'd talk to him. He's an incredibly smart guy. Now, imagine you get sent off to area. As for and they show you this thing that, you know, doesn't even exist and they tell you about this propulsion method that they don't understand. And they say that they found this a long time ago in an archaeological dig and they want you to back engineer it because you're a propulsion expert and they're running out of options.  They've been studying this for decades. No one knows what the fuck it is or how how you can make it work. And then they do test flights with this thing. And then he tells his friends about these test flights after he gets, you know, I get fired, you know, a story about him getting fired. He leaked it or something. No, no. His wife was fucking her flight instructor. And so when his wife was fucking a flight instructor, they told him he couldn't work anymore.  And he's like, why not? Well, they were tapping his phone because when you have top secret clearance to work on UFOs, I guess they don't want your flight. You're your wife, fucking her flight instructor, and you're going to go crazy. And you have have a lot of imbalance at home.  Right. So he doesn't know why. They don't tell him why. So he takes his friends and he tells them this is this is real. They're running these experiments. I know you thinking I'm crazy. This is what I've been working on. So he takes them to this area where you used to be able to have access to. But once he did this, they closed off access and pushed it far back to where the public has access to.  And he showed them these things, doing these impossible maneuvers in the desert, in the night sky. This I remember. And so then he gets arrested. And so when he gets arrested, he was a fear. He was in fear of his own life. He goes public and tells this whole story, and then they erases past their Social Security number, their race, his education background, even though people that knew him and knew he worked at Los Alamos Labs, he takes George Noory of a tour of Los Alamos Labs, knows the people that worked there.  They all say hi to him. He takes them on a tour around the laboratory. Yeah, shows them around, shows them the the devices they use for biometric security.  And I think the one thing you can't ignore is that he he there was there was documentation that he did work at one of these places.  Yes. And they later claimed he didn't. Yes. And like I was watching the thing on maybe was Netflix. I think like he promoted that right. It was yes. They show the paper like we found. Yes. Like, he clearly was there.  He was in the employee, right? Yeah.  No, but but, you know, for me, you know, man, I'd love to believe it all.  He's been insanely consistent about that story for forty years. I, I want to believe, you know, in thirty years, whatever, I yeah.  I want to believe too. That's the problem man. I didn't want to believe but that's nonsense. Picture it didn't happen is nonsense.  Well how do you, how do you you know, how do you what about Neanderthals. What about dinosaurs. Was not because I'm also joking.  Right. But I mean as some of the evidence. Right. I get it. Let's you know, the challenge with any theory. I don't I don't like saying conspiracy theory because there are always conspiracies is that people want something to be true.  And so they end up looking for things to justify what they think it already is. Of course, instead of starting with what you've got, trying to figure out where it goes from there.  But when you start with what you've got, you've got a guy who was living in Vegas, was taking these flights out to area Asfour knows the place, knows it inside out, can describe it very accurately. Also worked at Los Alamos. He describes that very accurately. It proves he worked there.  Yeah, but I suppose he's he's also a legitimate scientist. But what I mean, when you talk to the guy, he's a brilliant guy. He is not a nut. Right. But what are you saying?  Aliens? That doesn't mean aliens. No, I'm just asking, like so it doesn't mean aliens, but that's what he was told. What he was told is this is something that has come from somewhere else.  And they're trying to figure out how to work it, how to use what if we're in a simulation and this was something that was left over code or it, you know, wasn't supposed to be placed in this current iteration, would if there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to and that these things do.  You know, my favorite I want to call it a conspiracy theory, but one of my favorite stories is humanity emerged on Venus and that we destroyed the planet with a greenhouse effect. So we created the Ark project and took the DNA of two of every animal and loaded up on us on the last vessel, the Ark, and went to terraform Earth. And that the dumbest idea ever.  It's hilarious, the DNA of two of each animal. And then how many copies of those things do you make before? Or they eat each other. They got they got photograph that they just started seeding the planet and what people do. I'm not saying it's I think it's a fun story. They argue that the Bible was like the stories being told and retranslated over hundreds of years to a lost civilization that had only one ship escape the destruction of their planet.  And I'm not saying it's true. I'm saying it's a fun story. I love that story.  Yeah, it's fun. It would be a fun sci fi movie. And then you end up with lost tech being discovered.  Well, people like Elon that say we have to get off of Earth. You know, there's so many people that say we have to escape Earth. We have to we have to sort of colonize the solar system or colonize the galaxy.  I agree. And I think if we don't discover about a propulsion, then hard chemical energy, we're not going to do it.  So that's why this is so compelling, this idea that they're using some element that apparently is impossible to find here. You can only create it with a particle collider, but maybe in whatever solar system they are coming from, you have a very different environment. And maybe this element was the primary source for fuel. Maybe they figured that out a long time ago.  I wonder if I'd love to talk to an actual physicist about this.  Is there something with negative density? What's that mean? So like, you know, things with density create an attraction through gravity because they they the pressure that like their influence on spacetime. I'm not an astrophysicist, so I can't explain to you perfectly. But, you know, the larger, more dense the object, the more pull it has. You know, it's like a very dense black hole, for instance, sucks you in then, you know, Mars has less gravity than its less dense.  I wonder if there's something again, this probably you know, I'm sure that some scientists laughing right now. What a moron. But negative density, something that would actually have a push effect in terms of gravity, in which case you could have some kind of object with where you could control, expand and contract density so that you're pushing and pulling.  I don't know. But Bob Lazaro's perspective is if we showed a nuclear reactor to a civilization from the fourteen hundreds, they would think we're doing witchcraft, the ark of the Covenant.  Yeah, they would think it is absolutely the craziest thing that anyone has ever seen or heard. They would try to tamper with it. They'd all get radiation poisoning and die. They'd never be able to figure it out in a million years. We just left it with them.  If you left some sort of a nuclear reactor with them and he said this is really how far advanced he believes these these aliens or whatever you want to call them, are that they're they're science. They're technologies indistinguishable from magic because they're so far ahead of us.  Do you think they'd want to be involved with us beyond just testing us? Why wouldn't you? We study butterflies, we study mice, we study, we study bugs. And the other side of the planet, we send people on scientific journeys to go and look at frogs. Sure, sure. But not even sure are real anymore.  Are we giving guns to chimps? Are we are we building forts for them and teaching them to use stone? And I mean, we've seen now there's more videos coming out showing I can't watch primate species, but using more tools.  Yeah, well, they do that stuff. They believe that primates, chimps have entered the Stone Age. Yeah. They're using them on a regular basis.  Are we going to go and teach them agriculture? I mean, do we do we teach chimps things all the time, but.  Yeah, but environments. Because that's the only way you can study them. Yeah, we teach. I mean if they had a civilization you can go to, you knew they lived in an apartment and you could study them that way.  But you don't think that they would study if they found a planet like let's imagine if we found a planet, we found a planet and it's all just filled with octopus. And these octopuses are changing colors and just jack and fish and eating lobsters, we would be totally.  So it would be fascinating. Absolutely. Well, all innovation happens because people are trying to improve on initial designs. Now, why do they try to prove improve on initial designs? They try to make things that are better, make things that are more efficient, make things that can do tasks that they can't do without these tools. And then they their curiosity and their creativity causes them to expand upon these ideas.  Well, of course, if something's going to be so far advanced that they didn't accept their current place in the universe, they don't even accept the fact they want to stay on this planet. They want to travel to other places. Do you know, fucking insanely curious, you'd have to be to lock you and three of your other three foot buddies in a giant fucking flying saucer and propel yourself through space? Oh, yeah.  You would have to be incredibly curious and incredibly not just curious, but innovative.  They would have to be thinking about things. They would have to be exploring things. And of course, you would want to come to a planet that is filled with people who have hundreds of different languages.  They're all full of shit. They lie to each other constantly, send videos through the air. They have weapons that they could blow each other up with. Yeah, I mean, of course, you would be fascinated by that. I think that's the least compelling argument that anybody ever says. Why would they? That's with us. Why would they care about us? Of course they would care about us. We are fucking interesting, man. Well, I'll put it this way.  I think if we saw, like, a group of chimps standing near, like a water waterbed and then one chimp fashion, some kind of bag and pulls it over its head, jumps in the water and tries to go as low as you can for as long as it can before coming back out. We would look at that like that is the stupidest attempt at scuba diving I've ever seen. But oh, my God, a chimp just tried to scuba dive.  So if there are aliens and they're in these amazing technologically advanced ships that can jump like speed, maybe like gravity, they just watched us strap ourselves to an explosive and fire us off of our atmosphere where we're likely to die. And they're like, this is the stupidest attempt at actually going to space. These guys are trying to go to space.  I wouldn't think about that way at all. I would think about, look, there's a fucking space station. It's up there and people live on it. They shoot themselves as they were, very crude form of propulsion, but they figured it out because they don't have element 115 in their environment naturally. So these dummies have to light things on fire and use to push off the back of it, to shove themselves through normal air.  And you know why they're not going to give us a tick right now? Why would they give us why? Why did they give us? Why they wouldn't? I'm saying why would they give us tech? Why would any.  That's the weirdest argument ever that they're giving us things. I don't think they're giving a shit.  No, I don't think so either. I think they're specifically not doing it and they wouldn't do it even if we wanted them to. I think I think it's the inverse you people make. A lot of people talk about how they're like sharing technology with us or something. Right. You see that stuff in. Yeah, I've heard those conspiracies.  The reason they won't is because we're we're we're territorial. We we fight each other. Oh, for sure. So, look, if they came down and went to Russia and said, here's a.. Graph repulsion, we think Russia is going to do all right. Our planet now, they're going to immediately expand rapidly. Their population is going to grow exponentially. And it's going to cause massive turmoil between nuclear powers, which could destroy themselves. Yeah, for sure.  So you can use it as a weapon.  The smartest thing is to not share at all until we're a one world.  You know, society will also like look at what they look like when aliens look like. And if you look at the iconic shape of an alien, they have giant heads and genderless bodies.  Like maybe that's the key to stopping war is the no incentive whatsoever for people to be sexual or attractive. Everybody looks exactly the same. We get over this idea of biological mating. They reproduce through genetic engineering.  Why not just be robots? Or maybe they are like robots. Maybe that is like a robot.  Artificial bodies where you you know. Have you seen altered carbon? I haven't, but I keep hearing good things about it.  I just finished season to season one was awesome. But basically they have a thing called a stack. You said you finish season to season one is awesome. That means season two sucks.  Season two is a C plus season once again. Plus plus. Yeah, like yeah it's fun, but I think all the stack in the base of their, their spinal column right below their, their head that stores their consciousness and they call their bodies sleeves and they kind of don't care when they die because they just get you know, it's if you're poor you get really crappy sleeves. Right. But if you're if you're rich, you get premium access, military upgrade, like high tech, very strong.  But their bodies just become separate. And you can also transport your consciousness, interstellar like to other planets. And then you wake up in a body in a different light. That's how you go places. Now your consciousness travels.  So, yeah, I mean, maybe aliens do that. Maybe there's there's not you know, I'm I find the the idea of the various alien life bodies curious. One of the one of the things I've read about is that it could be humans from the future. Yeah, I've heard that, too.  That makes sense. You think about what we look like as opposed to like what a chimp looks like, and then you keep going further with that, like, oh, the head will get bigger, the body will get weaker.  And then look, there's a sort of a trend in this society today to to be less masculine, less feminine, more gender neutral.  And these. Well, so they them pronouns. Maybe that's all just part of the programming.  This this falls into another one of these conspiracy theories that the goal of the globalists is that in order to get access to alien tech, we have to be a unified planet. Aliens aren't going to give aliens. We've heard that one. Oh, yeah, it's all over the Internet. That's why they're doing this. So they're going with a one world order in order to get alien tech.  Do you think the Galactic Federation is going to let a planet in which has got numerous governing bodies and nuclear weapons?  It is a galactic federation. I'm just I'm just kidding. Right. About the point I'm making is there are people online who believe this. They believe that if there is some kind of galactic federation or at least some kind of recognizable, you know, different cultures that have some kind of set rule base. Right. Who do they negotiate with us? Russia, China.  And so the argument? Well, one of the theories is that interest on the United States who have access to the aliens know that they have to do everything in their power to unify the entire planet under one authority so that we can be entered into whatever alien, you know, access would exist.  But so long as we are nuclear powered, competing territorial factions, they can't do it.  Well, that makes sense if that was the case. But you add in what you what you were saying about masculinity and gender. And one of the things that I find interesting is that when it comes to this argument about removing masculinity, there's kind of overlap with this idea of domestication. You think about wolves, Proteau, dogs and dogs. Dogs are effectively wolf cubs, perpetually. So wolves are aggressive, territorial, independent. I mean independent in the sense of like, you're not going to tame them.  They're like wolves. Yeah. Yeah. Like you willing to listen to you. I mean, you can, but it's like it's there. They agree with you or they don't. You're following, you know, so an adult, masculine, tough human is going to be like, I'm independent, I'm in charge. They've got to remove that and domesticate us. So you get a bunch of weak, effeminate, genderless humans who are going to be passive, docile and agreeable.  Yeah, like dogs, right? Yeah. Do I have a whole bit about what wolves are and what dogs are. Yeah.  And what men used to be and what men are now.  I was thinking of this really cool idea for a sci fi film where aliens come to Earth and most humanity accepts domestication. And then 300, 400 years from now, you've got regular looking twenty first century kind of men and women. But then you have these five foot tall super armored jetpack with plasma rifles that love and serve the aliens. And we view them as freakish genetic defects.  So have you seen, like, oblivion with Tom Cruise? Yes. The aliens basically genetically engineered a whole bunch of Tom Cruise as I was thinking of that kind of idea, but also with domestication.  That's an underrated movie, by the way. That's cool. I love it. Yeah, very good movie.  If if aliens came to Earth and most humans agreed. And then over time, the humans that got access to life saving technology, special armor, were the ones that were agreeable and less likely to be aggressive.  They would bitch out just like the wolves bitched out and became a poodle, and then you'd have wolves. I thought of a cool idea for a story. You basically, if humans like riding a chicken coop and the aliens are like and they call their attack humans who jump out with like armor and crazy future attack from the aliens, but they're like the small dog like versions of humans, you know, like desperately in love with the aliens, you know.  Right. Just like crying and dogs. Yeah, yeah. Wolves aren't like that.  But I wonder if the people would eat those dog like people the way wolves eat dogs.  Well, for the sake of of a fiction, no, we wouldn't have them do that.  But what would coyotes be? Coyotes. You'd be like this. Sneaky, smaller.  But our ideas aren't aren't the product of domestication. I mean, they're just a separate canine breed, I guess, or species. Right.  But I'm saying, like, they they really never got domesticated. Yeah, that's what's interesting. It's like they're. I mean, you saw a coyote version of humans. Yeah, the North Central Island, right. You know. Yeah. Yeah. The people have never had contact with humans. Well, they've had several bad experiences with other people, with the arrows of helicopters and stuff.  Well, that's why they killed that guy.  They killed that they killed the missionary because they were invaded in the eighteen hundreds by a guy named Morris Vidal Portman, who was a pervert slash explorer who, you know, measured dicks and take detailed descriptions of people's anatomy and genitals.  I mean, was it for legitimate research purposes? No fucking wacko. Just find people and run tests on them?  Yeah, that would be what we'd worried about with aliens, too. Right. To be here. Maybe that's why that's why people are worried about them touching their asshole. Well, sometimes only the pervert aliens.  Somebody posted this tweet. They said something about like, you need to realize the aliens who would come to Earth aren't the cool nerds who want to, like, talk science. It's the rich assholes who, you know, fucked their planet and they're dipping out myths.  That's a silly way to look at it. Well, I mean, it's one possibility, I understand, but that's us. We always want to look at things through like a human centric filter. Exactly. But if they're genderless things from from the future, like what benefit would it be to get richer?  You know, they have their giant heads and they travel the speed of light like this is this is why I really don't like I think it's Hawking's argument that we shouldn't we shouldn't be excited about aliens, because whenever a more powerful civilization approaches a weaker one, they dominate it. It's like, yeah, I don't I don't buy I don't buy it for two seconds in terms of aliens coming to Earth, that that makes no sense.  What what. So the argument by what Hawking's argument.  Oh you don't that if aliens came to Earth they would enslave us to to steal our resources.  Well, I don't necessarily think they would enslave us to steal our resources, but if we were aware of them, they would become space daddy.  Well, what he's what he's saying is like, you know, when when the Europeans came to North America and spread disease and then stole land, started wiping everybody out, like when when when a more advanced civilization means, you know, you know, I don't think aliens would do that at all.  It's like, why not? The way the way I would view the most devastating approach would be more like a gigantic vessel coming down and just slicing a skyscraper in half and stripping out all the copper and elements while ignoring the people.  And when we go to a habitat for animals, we're not going to like, ha, we'll kill all the squirrels. We're like, we're taking the no squirrels be damned. So we go into habitats where other creatures live, take what we want. And we we don't care about the animals. We don't we farm. We kill all the mice and our little critters and their we don't care. So I don't like the I don't think the argument makes sense that a more advanced civilization would come to Earth and be like, ha, humans.  Now you will serve us and it's our land now. They would have completely ignore us and just start taking stuff and crushing us and ignoring us. It wouldn't be.  But I don't I don't think that's the most likely scenario either. I think any any race sufficiently advanced enough to travel the massive size of the universe would have little need for the primitive elements on our planet and would actually be substantially easier for them to go to any other employee.  No, it's not true. We have no idea. No, we've no idea what they need. Like, this might be an incredibly rare place. It's incredibly rare as far as everything we've been able to observe. They might come here because they found this Goldilocks planet that has liquid water and incredible biodiversity and more life than any other place on Earth or any other place in the solar system. You know, the are in the known galaxy.  You know, the Eris planet theory, right. Was that that's it. There's an elliptical orbit for a planet that every three hundred years comes in, comes and close orbit to Earth. It's elliptical around our sun. Yeah.  It's planet Nibiru. Nibiru. Yeah. Yeah. And that they they used human slave labor for mining gold.  Yes. That's all. Zechariah Cichon. Yeah. No, Zacharias Kitchener's. I've heard the name. I've read the stuff.  You wrote a book called The 12th Planet. That's a fascinating take on the ancient Sumerian texts.  And he's widely been criticized by other scholars who understand ancient Sumerian. Yeah, and there's actually a website called Cichon is Wrong. See if you can go to it.  Sechin is wrong, Dotcom, because all the whack jobs like me who love the idea of, you know, oh, that's why we're so into Goldman.  Right. Because the aliens use the suspended gold particles in their atmosphere atmosphere to protect their atmosphere from deterioration by their, you know, industrial use of chemicals and toxins has destroyed their environment. So oxygen is wrong. Dotcom is an interesting Web site and I don't know who's right and who's wrong.  And I think if you want to go over the Anunnaki and the ancient what's really interesting and not just about Sechin, but about Sumaya in general is one thing is they had these tablets, these clay tablets that had a depiction of the galaxy or the depiction of the solar system.  Now you're talking about 6000 B.C. They have this depiction of the solar system that shows the sun in the center. And it shows all of the planets in our known galaxy are known solar system with a proper perspective in terms of the size of the planet and the proper distance like they're in the right places. It's not like there's a big one really close to the sun and there's a little one three planets out like see if you could find that it's a weird image.  See, that's the image.  Yeah, right there. The take that Zacharias Hitchen had was that they were trying to tell us that they have come from this other planet and they were trying to explain to us what our solar system is, but just the fact that they have this sun in the center and then they have all the planets that we know of circling this sun. And this has been criticized like, oh, no, they didn't do it right, that first of all, they did it in clay.  OK, so relax there. It's so goddamn close that you would have to say, man, that might be what that is. And if that is what that is, what are they trying to say with this thing? Because there's also an image from a clay tablet of a very large being that has a very small human like being with a monkey tail on its lap. And this is what Cichon points to as some sort of a depiction of the genetic engineering that took place to turn primitive primates into human beings.  This is the reason why we are so different from every other animal on this planet.  And the real thing that when when people talk about aliens and alien, what would aliens be doing here? Why would the what if human beings are the product of accelerated evolution? Like what if they came down here, they found this incredibly rich planet that's filled with biodiversity and all these different lifeforms, and then they found these primates and like, oh, we know where these fuckers are going. Like, this is us 10 billion years ago or whatever the fuck it is.  Let's accelerate this little party. Let's inject some of our super advanced DNA into these primates and let's see let's see where it takes itself.  So do you think you think. Yeah, that's a fun story.  That's the story that they told. Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba said. I don't know if they told me that to throw us off the trail, if it's disinformation or if it's just some wacky thing that they came up with to just like have a crazy story that the scientists couldn't tell anybody.  So if you do tell people like, what are you working on?  I'm working on reverse engineering a propulsion system from an aircraft that came from another planet. And by the way, we are a product, product of accelerated evolution.  They came to us and they injected our DNA.  And, you know, well, think about that story in the context of ancient religions and a lot of the commonalities, notably like Abrahamic, this idea that we were created, that we were told we shouldn't do certain things. So I think these are all fun stories.  But, yeah, you could look at the idea of someone being the son of God, you know, a hybrid, right?  Yeah. You could look at the stories of regular old Genesis taking the rib of Adam to creative. Well, yeah, the genetic matter and then manipulating it.  So, you know, I get I get a lot of heat from my more religious friends for pointing that out that I believe the Bible is more likely and an odds base to be about aliens and about the actual creator of the universe. And I'm talking astronomical odds like ridiculously astronomical. But I think we actually know some things exist. Genetic manipulation, cargo cults. We know how primitive life form reacts to more advanced technology. They don't understand. And that would make more sense to me than, you know, believing in a hard religion about the creator and, you know, Carpenters' and things like that.  Yeah, well, it's also we're dealing with translations, right. That have gone on for thousands and thousands of years that are a story that was told as an oral tradition for a thousand years before that.  Like, boy, the saying hard and fast exactly what they meant in the Bible and what this means and what must have happened for them to write that down to me is just bonkers.  I mean, who who knows? But what we do know is that the older the stories get, the weirder they get. Like, that's one of the weird things about the ancient Sumerian taxes that you're dealing now. You're in like the six thousand years ago range.  Yeah. Which is really weird like that.  It's a long fucking time ago I saw that conversation and that dude about the Sphinx, I think he's I was like 9000 B.C. or something.  Well, this is Graham Hancock and or Robert Schalk.  Robert Schock, who is a geologist at Boston University, has actually taken the time to examine the erosion around the outside of the Sphinx, i.e., the Sphinx itself has been worked on a lot. It has been a lot of rehabilitation of the pores. They've sort of rebuilt it, which is kind of a shame. But it's it's made out of a sort of a soft stone and it's eroding and falling apart. And when they found. The Sphinx, like when Napoleon found the Sphinx, it was buried, it was buried under sand.  So this is the thing that had been buried in and exposed many times, they think, throughout history.  And what Robert Shock had found in discovering this, the temple where the Sphinx was carved and the the area that surrounds the Sphinx was this deep fissures in the walls that were indicative of thousands of years of rainfall. The problem with that is the last time there was rainfall in the Nile Valley was 9000 B.C.  Right, right. Right. So they're dealing with like and you have to go back thousands of or 9000 years ago, maybe 7000 B.C. But you have to deal with thousands of years of rainfall prior to that to create this. So that means that this was something that was clearly carved by man has thousands of years of rainfall that eroded it. And you're dealing with a time period where the last time they had this rainfall in this area was thousands of years before they think people were even capable of building things like this.  Maybe it was the lizard people like, you know you know that theory about superintelligent dinosaurs that fled underground? Oh, God, no. But it's funny.  Like, there's so many wacky theories. It's funny what I'll roll my eyes at, isn't it?  Even slightly even a tiny, tiny bit more likely that humans came from a different planet and after they destroyed it and then receded and we lost our way of life? Yeah, it's possible.  Look, if we're going to go to Mars, like, what is the fuckin origin tale going to look like a hundred thousand years from now?  Once we go to Mars, let's take the climate change, you know, global warming stuff to its logical conclusion of rising tides and a greenhouse runaway greenhouse effect.  So we build one ship. Elon Musk builds one ship with a very small crew of, you know, how many people are going to be on that, you know, on his mission.  Got to have some chicks, though. Yeah, I think I repopulate the earth, right. So it's got to be men and women and the people are going to have to be boy, heterosexuality is going to be favored because you really can't have gay people that aren't going to breed. You know, you have two lesbians like, oh, we need to have it only populated by lesbians. Well, there's no question. Do you guys have buckets of sperm and a turkey baster?  Because how else are you going to make people when you're over there?  I was reading that they're going to go with people who are already coupled and they're going to, you know, with like 10 couples or whatever. I don't know about Elon Musk specifically, but that was a lot of swapping going on.  SpaceX, they did talk about that, too.  I was reading like the most optimal theory for colonizing Mars would be like polyamorous people, something like 10 people already coupled now that they're polyamorous, but they expect there's going to be comingling, eventually expect comingling.  Oh, so it's Burning Man in space. But but check it out. Let's say let's say we send to Mars expedition, you know, 10 families. We've got, you know, two of each start having kids. We send cargo there, they start building and then Earthwatch itself out runaway greenhouse. We can't get control things, nuclear war, whatever. Right. The planet becomes a desolate wasteland. There's no more communication to those who are on Mars.  So the last remaining hundred or so people who are now on Mars, the adults who remember Earth right now, the book hears everything happened here we should and shouldn't do.  Here's how we lived. And they give to their kids and other kids never experienced Earth. They know nothing about it. In fact, those kids only have a fleeting image of the technology that they once had. Now go to more generations down. The old tech where we used to colonize Mars is now decaying and falling apart. They have no idea to fix it. The original colonists are dead. Go down three more generations. Now I've got a few thousand humans start moving off looking for resources and no one has any idea.  Earth even was a real thing other than the stories they heard about the military leader in in the in the orbital orbital space station who long since died. So now they have this book they don't fully understand. Their language is now changing as they separate from each other and find different areas of the planet. Now, English or whatever language they were speaking becomes ten different languages. Now they're translating the book. Now it's a thousand years later, they don't even know Earth existed.  And they have this weird book about the way things used to be. And now out of the billions of, you know, now we're ten thousand, twenty thousand years in the future and they find, you know, these old ancient relics and they're like, I wonder, what if you don't even smoke pot, do?  No, man, I don't smoke.  But imagine if you did did you'd have so many more of these theories to be one.  That's a good theory. But that's to me, that's the logical conclusion. That's why I like the story of, like, humans came from Venus.  I saying it's true that there's a there's a oh, there's a group of people from Africa that actually the the Dogon de dodgin peoples, what it is, Dogon people. And they they talk about the very specific area of Mars where human beings came from. And they have a really weird understanding of cosmology. Like they they know some things like where did you want? And their origin story is that people were living on Mars and that they just.  Broyd, Mars and How to Escape Mars and come to Earth. So it's sort of a very similar version of it. And now when you add that to what they know about Mars, that Mars used to be like a hospitable place to many water.  Yeah, well, think about this way, too. Let's say that we had an orbital space station over the new planet where terraforming.  Hmm. What kind of government would exist? Let's say earth is wiped out. Right. The only survivors and an orbital space station over Mars with the small colony on the base. It's going to be a military dictatorship, not intentionally, not from this evil perspective, but from a you're the general, you're second in command. We've always operated this way. It's a military mission. You know, the person who's in charge is in charge. And then eventually you build up the colony to a certain point where second, second in command or one of the favorite lieutenants says it's time to enact democracy.  And the general says, fuck no. And then a civil war breaks out in the heavens. People on the ground watching the ships shoot at each other and blow each other up, and then all the technology gets wiped out.  You should really start smoking pot now and you don't, you know, but there's a lot of ways to interpret, like various ancient spiritual religious texts in a science fiction kind of way.  So I actually, you know, talk to my friends about this and we like kind of what if what if the Bible and, you know, the Old Testament were viewed from a science fiction perspective, not to be disrespectful.  I'm not trying to disrespect anyone's religion or anything like that. But like what if we tried to apply a lens of from a futuristic perspective of our understanding technology to how they may have viewed what was going on back then?  So, you know, the cargo cults are. Yes, for those that don't, you know, these natives on these islands saw planes. They know they were. So they built effigies of the planes like, I guess hoping they'd come back or whatever. Right. So when I saw that, I wondered, you know, a lot of people ask that question, what if we did the same thing with aliens? And the other question is, what would we do if we destroyed our own planet like people say we are?  And how would that how would that, you know, result in a government that result in stories?  It would be so funny if we destroy this planet, we go to Mars and repopulate Mars and fix it up and then destroy that place and come back to Earth after we're done because like, look at what's going on right now. During this pandemic, the skies are clearer than ever before, the Venice canals in Italy of dolphins in them. Now, you could see the ground jellyfish.  You realize how disgusting we are and how we're gross. Like what we've done to Los Angeles is amazing. And in just a month and a half, the air is pristine, crystal clear.  You could see forever. It's a different world. Now, imagine if that's what happens if we go to Mars. We fucked that place up, come back to Earth. Look, it's fixed. We're back.  You know, I guess if we can sustain our technology. Yeah.  Did you find Dogon tribe find that it actually is talking about Siri right now to Mars, but didn't they have something about Mars as well?  That type of literally that and Mars. And that just took me to serious stuff instead of Mars.  Serious. Yeah, the star. The star. Serious, but they understand they have a story on it.  If you can't. It's a it's a weird thing in terms of like the cosmology, like what they understand. And this is, you know, relatively primitive tribe that has this origin story.  Well, it's like the end of Battlestar isn't very good at all. Oh, the end of Battlestar Galactica. They find Earth.  The fucking new Battlestar Galactica is so good, isn't it? Yeah, it's one of the more recent raid. Yeah. The more recent one, one of the most underrated science fiction series ever.  It was so good. Well, not to act like my ideas are original. The series ends with them discovering a habitable planet.  With what? Spoiler alert. Spoiler alert with a species that's compatible with them. Yeah, they find primitive humans. Yes. And so if that story, you know, it's an interesting story. Yes.  We would lose all knowledge of the previous planets and technology and.  Well, imagine if we flew to another planet for the first time.  We landed there and it's like 1940s America was like, whoa, or maybe do if we could fuck them, you know, maybe we'll press with you.  Well, what if what if we find a spaceship underground with ancient tech and we don't know what it is and it turns out it's ours, the Dogon tribe, the Gnomeo, and they're fascinating cosmic knowledge deep in northwest Africa. More precisely in Mali, we find one of the oldest, most fascinating ancient cultures to develop on Earth. So the ancient Dogon tribe is known for the religious traditions, ritual dances, their massive ritual masks, their wooden sculptures and their architecture.  However, they're also known for their incredible astronomical knowledge and their fascinating mythological accounts. The Dogon have a compelling ancient tradition. They mentioned myths and legends that go thousands of years into the past, predating possibly even their own history. Some authors like Robert Shock, who's also the guy from Boston University, he's the geologist that talked about the springs, argue that the Dogon, where people who originated in Africa but who had been forced to leave ancient Egypt due to their religious persecutions, it is in his opinion that the Dogon may preserve ancient Egypt.  Traditions and myths there may even have been carried into the present age, claiming that the Dogon have a powerful cosmic connection, I can go on for this will take too long to read. Yeah, because I'm just going to just blog.  So what does that coincidence? Ancient knowledge?  Well, just they understand the cosmos and you'd have to go into the story. But it's a it's a weird story. It's a weird like, oh, how do they know this. Like what what a weird origin story.  But you've seen Zeitgeist, the original. Yes. Where where you know, in the first time when he talks about the three kings of Orion's belt pointing to the star in the east where the sun rises in the third day. Yeah, yeah. Maybe maybe their stories are just just that, you know, we what could we do but stare at the sky. And that's a good point.  Yeah. When you stop and look, if you were traveling across the country as you were, did you get a chance to stop and look in the middle of nowhere at the sky?  Of course. Fucking amazing. Yeah.  Isn't it, Nicholas, isn't it gross that we're robbed of that?  Yeah, and it wasn't there was a story that I think in Los Angeles, the power went out this blackout in the 90s, and the police got tons of calls from people who didn't know what they were seeing in the sky.  It was the Milky Way galaxy, those same people that are injecting Lysol right now that they aren't, though. I know. You know, somebody might it's probably a few. Yeah, well, you know, if you're going to.  What about now?  Chloroquine thing? You know, the one form of chloroquine that was chloroquine, but the the form that was a pond cleaner.  Oh, yeah. But here's the thing.  The lady, wasn't she like a Democratic contributor, big donor. She had tweeted that Donald Trump was a psycho like that and her and her husband took the stuff.  Well, there's new reporting that says the husband was an engineer. His friends are shocked that he would do something so stupid. So the wife poisoned him.  That's the theory that's going around now.  Now, the Fairpoint brought up, I think it was a free beacon, is that he trusted his wife and he loved her well, and she loved him or she's really dumb or shut the fuck out of apparently a couple of decades ago, she had struck him as a report about it.  Decades ago. Yeah. Twenty years, I think. But there's also reports and you guys, you got to factor the stuff for sure because it's not like something I've not been diving too much too deep into. But she was trying to force the guy.  Man So the story popping up is that she's the owner, Carol Baskin of chloroquine.  That's what people have been saying. Yeah. Like the rumors going around. But whether or not any that's true, it's like, you know, I always say, give me the proof. But I can't say this, but the media loves to run everything the president says through a filter of like it must be taken literally or to its worst, most the opposite of benefit doubt, the most negative conclusion possible. If he says it, we're going to run the most negative interpretation.  It's bad. It's awful. You know, so when he says something like, you know, that Peter Navarro instance where he said, you know, you're your nasty reporter, he said about hydroxyl, chloroquine and chloroquine, it might work. It might not. But I'm optimistic. What are the press run with? Trump recommends untested, dangerous drug.  Meanwhile, you get unscrupulous press. Don't all press around with that. Right? Right. Of course. But but look, when Andrew Cuomo came out and said, we're gonna start trialling, you know, chloroquine, anhydrase, chloroquine and Assister Meyssan, where was the negative press?  Didn't they say that that is actually been proven to kill more people than not using it, though? I think politics.  Yeah, one of the initial stories that come out said that it was actually more likely to kill. So the CDC had listed that this was actual treatment used by many countries. And we have there's a lawmaker in Michigan, she's a Democrat. She was given the treatment that saved her life and she personally praised the president for it, for that she's being censured and being stripped of any endorsements.  I've heard of that, which is crazy. It is because there's a reason why they were using it. They showed it showed some promise with some people.  I guess the idea was that the extreme immune system reaction in your lungs was killing people, the swelling in the fluid build up. So by suppressing the immune system, you would stop that from happening. The symptoms would abide and you eventually recover. You know what, man?  If the media there's a graph showing the amount of press Obama got versus Trump, what Trump got and I think to a certain degree, Trump brought on himself because he chased after this press and he and he baits them and he goes after them. Right. But it's like three or four times as much news, but it's also a different world.  Now, if you go back to 2008, 2008, rather, when Obama was elected, the influence of like online media and the ability to pull our eyes away from traditional media sources was nothing was nothing that newspapers were still real.  People were buying newspapers. Yeah. I mean, mainstream media was the only way you got your news. Now, there's people like you. You know, there's there's there's people like Kolinsky or Jimmy Dorje. There's there's people like the Hill. They have these online platforms where this is they're not only the more viable than the traditional media outlets, they're more accurate. They're they're less biased. They're they're younger and more intelligent. They're not connected to some gigantic media machine that has a very consistent bias.  I think we're seeing substantially more bias than ever before and from online things from from from everything, from everything.  But it starts with people like me. So, look, I'm an individual. I have an opinion. There are things that I think are more important than other things. I look at this establishment press, this behemoth constantly lying to people. Not every single journalist I know, many journalists, they're fantastic at their jobs. They risk their lives.  They do good stories, even political reporters. You know my respect to Ben Smith, formerly of BuzzFeed News. Now New York Times calling out The New York Times, well, sort of for their defense of Joe Biden calling out CNN. Right. There's great reporters, but you have a lot of people in media who's their goal is just survive, make money.  And so what happens with YouTube? One of the reasons I think they started censoring a lot of channels is what works. Shock content, sensational debate. So YouTube hard suppresses that.  It's not entirely fair, but there's no real good answer to how you deal with this. And it's unfair to a lot of independent creators because like you mentioned, YouTube doesn't know better. They're like, who's credible? But CNN starts adopting the same tactic. So now, you know, CNN realizing they can't win no matter what they do. They're competing with free videos on Facebook.  You know, you know, mom and Pop who post that video from the rally on Facebook costs them nothing. They don't care. And CNN has got to pay someone 30 to 50 thousand dollars a year to low level to to to make this kind of content they're losing. So they switch it up. Now we're being told that they are accountable, you know, are a credible, credible news outlets, authoritative sources. They're the same thing is what the YouTube ers were.  Look, I mean, when you get Don Lemon going on on the show asking if a black hole swallowed an airplane, how is that any different from the crackpots?  It was Don Lemon asked a guest if a black hole swallowed the missing Malaysian airplane.  Wait a minute. He was serious. He said, I know it's preposterous, but is it preposterous?  And the woman responded, when we have to see the totally Don Lemon.  Don Lemon asked about a black hole swallowing airplane. I get a kick out of him. I like when he gets mad, but it's performative. It's not real news. So, you know, I think it's I think we're seeing a certain kind of creator emerge that are good. I think Jimmy and Kyle are awesome. I think I do a good job. I think I'm perfect, but I think we're all biased. And so that's why I always tell people you can't just watch me like you definitely got to watch Kyle Pacman or Jimmy Door.  And I get a lot of heat because people like you always recommend these left wing channels.  I'm like, all right, Steven Crowder, you know, for instance, Sticks and Hammer, these are good, good YouTube channels, but we're biased.  I think we all try to be as honest as we can. These big corporate channels are trying to survive. They don't care about honesty. So Brian Stelter on CNN actually said he shows a bunch of views from Fox News and says, don't watch the spin, watch us. We're going to give you the facts, don't I? Look, man, if someone tells you not to seek information outside, I wouldn't trust that. I don't want to tell you what to listen to, but I will tell you, if you only watch my stuff, you're missing out.  You got to watch other perspectives.  I want to see Don Lemon and Brian Stelter on Naked and Afraid in the Woods.  Do you get trying to get by saying the black hole thing?  He did it. This is from twenty fourteen. Oh yeah. So it was from. I think so. He has a while ago. Let me hear him say that. But what if it was something fully that we don't really understand? A lot of people have been asking about that, about black holes and on and on and on and all of these conspiracy theories. Just look at this. Noah says, What else can you think about black hole, Bermuda Triangle?  And then she says, just like the movie Lost. And of course, it's also also referencing The Twilight Zone, which is a very similar plot. That's what people are saying. I know it's preposterous, but is it preposterous, you think, Mary?  Well, it is. A black hole is about, you know, a small black hole would suck in our entire universe. So we know it's not that the triangle is often weather and Lost is a TV show.  So I think two things for which he's just being provocative to get someone to answer a silly question that's being bandied about on the Internet. He's not saying it like he believes it. No, no, no.  What I mean is that he's he's presenting the conversation. That's what it's become. It's become.  Well, I think he's doing entertainment because first of all, back then, I mean, this was 2014, 10 or 20 feet.  I think people were just starting to understand, like, the impact of comments and and they were addressing them and they were probably trying to silence a lot of the nonsense.  But then you get a woman saying stupid shit like the small black hole would swallow the whole universe. Yeah, well, I don't think she's a real expert if she said that. Right. So why why is Don Lemon asking nonsensical questions to two guests who can't answer them properly at all?  Well, he's just trying to be provocative.  I get it. I get it. And so what I want I mean, to say is that you're watching negative look at where they were in 2014. Look where they are now with faking the Chris Cuomo thing.  They've they've that's that's his idea. The Chris Cuomo thing is pretty gross. Did you hear what he said on his radio show, Noticer? He said, I don't find value in what I do. I think it's ridiculous.  He said, I don't like what I do for a living.  I don't like occupation. I think, you know, and then he said something to the effect of I'll never beat them in reference to like Hannity and Maddow or something like that.  I think it might hurt them in ratings and ratings. He's their biggest show. He is. I'm pretty sure Cuomo is their biggest show. Yeah.  He's the only one that seems to be a man.  And he doesn't crack a million in the ratings. Really? Yeah, it's like I think it's like 800 to 900. I think he practically might the ratings might be going up. I could be wrong. So check the latest stats. But I think yeah.  But I think the CEO producers went to him and said, look, man, you got this thing like we should we should we should run with it. Let's like, go to your house, we'll film it will make this big deal. I think so. And I think it wasn't that bad. I think he had mild symptoms. Look, the dude went out, the guy left his home.  He was young when he was talking about the issues he was having. He was he seemed normal, right. Like here's what I would expect from someone who is as sick as he seemed to be. I don't feel that good.  But, hey, I'm one of the lucky ones now. He seems totally normal. Yeah, that's what I would expect. He's saying he's shivering so hard, he's chipping his teeth.  It seems ridiculous. Yeah, it doesn't seem I'm not going to I don't know. I mean, maybe when it's nighttime and you're tired because one of the things I remember last time I was sick was quite a while ago. At the end of the night, I'd be like really achy because I was tired and I was as I was tired, my immune system would be depleted and then I would feel the effects of the cold more. And then you wake up in the morning, you feel a lot better, maybe pop some ibuprofen.  I know you're taking Tylenol, so I'm supposed to take ibuprofen for this for some reason.  Well, I think he was taking my friend Michael Yo said that he was told to take ibuprofen and when he did, it made it way worse. Oh, yeah.  Well, so so here's here's what can I say? I'm not going to accuse the guy a lot of people are planning. Everyone got sick. I don't think that's the case.  He probably got sick. He tested positive. But I think he it seemed fairly mild in comparison to other people like Michael Yo when I talk to him.  Well, first of all, when he was doing a video talking about recovering from it was coughing even in the video, he was coughing when he was talking about on Instagram.  Thank you, everybody. But he had a bad case of it. He got pneumonia and it was rough. And, you know, Michael's a healthy guy.  So that was disturbing to me. But the Chris Cuomo version of Coronavirus didn't seem that scary.  The dude wasn't quarantined, OK? He went out to some property 30 minutes from his home, presumably with his family. He was witnessed by somebody else.  Not supposed to do that right now.  You're not I mean, it's not just that. But on CNN, they said he was locked down. They did this whole reveal where he comes out of the basement.  I've been waiting for this to didn't do a tick tock dance with his daughters. I don't know. But I think he did.  But I think the reason he went on his show complaining was because the music was coming. The producers told him to do this fake thing and he didn't want to do it. You want you're right.  Look, man, I worked. When I make sense, you can't call them out because you want to keep the job.  When I worked for, you know, one of these companies, they told me to side with the audience. We talked about it last time I was here. They wanted me to create a narrative that the audience agreed with because we were there to serve them. What was the narrative?  Young progressives, whatever they say, so social justice.  So whatever young progressives say we want to side with.  And I told him, I asked, are you saying. If there's a factual news story that would be upsetting to our audience, we won't cover it. I said I think that's fair. What was it? The AOC said recently that people shouldn't go back to work, that they should they shouldn't like they should.  Yeah, they should protest. Like, not not go back to work. That, to me, was one of the craziest things I've ever heard a politician say. If anything, we need to get the goddamn economy back on track.  I wonder if she's going to lose in a primary. She's going up against a woman named Michelle Caruso-Cabrera, who is a moderate who actually sounds very reasonable. And and it kind of breaks my heart a bit because I remember how Democrats used to be like, you can look at the things she talks about and she's a very reasonable like she's got like a book. She was an anchor for some, I think for like CNBC or something.  And she comes off like, I don't know, kind of like maybe you were me.  Just how what used to be left before they went became radical activists for social justice.  Why do you think they went that way? Why do you think it was so? I mean, do you think so. Yeah. So yeah, there's a couple different layers I have on it.  Conservatives are less likely to be online and a lot of area of the country, they have weaker Internet, but they're so active online they dominate for sure.  And that's one of the reasons they're like, you know, they get wiped out a lot. But you look at what we're talking about, conservatives.  Yeah, concert is getting banned a whole lot because they're very active. They do a lot of memes, but I think so.  How are you saying that they're less likely to have good Internet, rural, rural towns, rural have really bad Internet, but it's good enough to be able to post on Twitter like, what do you mean no?  Yes, they have phones, but with if you've got dial up in the middle of the country, you're not posting a video or photo on your phone. You're watching dial up. Yeah, that's true. And doing it through their phones. That's a good point.  What I think is that you've got a lot of older people that are conservative, a lot of younger people that are liberal. And there's there's issues there with how people interact online.  So. My assumptions, my opinions, things I've read, older people more likely to just follow and read, younger people more likely to engage, most people not likely to engage at all. It's something I think like two percent of the country is actually active on Twitter. Yeah, but you end up with internal biases, the social media companies who is authoritative and who isn't echo chambers.  So a really good example is like BuzzFeed News wrote a story that the woman biolab leak theory is a right wing, you know, popular right wing theory.  Trump supporters are pushing it. And here's why it's wrong. But CNN ran multiple segments about this. And so when when you have digital media framing things as always, like you ever wonder why they never say left wing? You know, like in the media, they'll say conservatives did X, they never say liberals did X because they view themselves as those people. Right. So you end up with social media companies that view that kind of content as authoritative, left leaning.  You end up with left wing activists and acceptable marketability. There was a study done where they tracked essentially like a visualization of location for various aspects of of the Internet. Conservatives are in this bubble, liberals in this bubble, marketing, digital marketing companies overlapped with resistance, Twitter, anti Trump. So what ends up happening is big marketing firms based in New York City, based in Los Angeles, very urban areas, much more likely to be blue, have a blue perspective.  They run commercials based on a left wing perspective. Politicians see it with what the television is saying. They see what the websites are saying and they say this is what America wants. It's not. It's what the hyperactive two percent of Twitter wants. So they fall into that trap where they believe all this stuff. The reason your Catesby got elected, she won. I think she got 17000 votes in a district of 700000. Like that's not winning a real election, but it was an exploit.  It was exploiting the system. So you end up with someone who has views that don't represent the overwhelming majority of this country in a very high profile position influencing Nancy Pelosi. And, you know, one of the reasons they think they even went forward with impeachment was because of Cosio quotas, gave a statement where she said it was a bigger scandal, that the Democrats would not impeach Trump. Next thing we know, Nancy Pelosi hops on board with the idea and that blew up in their face.  Trump ends up seeing as approval rating go up. He raises a ton of money.  It would be really interesting if what did him in was the Lysol shit. Oh, that was bad for him, though. Yeah, but I don't imagine. Yeah, I don't think it'll be a what do you think is going to happen in November? As of right now, there's. The panic factor could be good for Trump, the fact that we're in a crisis may mean people are desperate for security and they don't want to take a chance. They don't take any chances.  And Trump is a bully.  Like I don't mean that necessarily as like, you know, to the Trump supporters, get mad. What I mean is, like, he's he pushes people around and a lot of people like that about him that he he yells at the press. What a lot of people on the left don't get is when he yelled at that CNN guy, you're a nasty reporter. His base was clapping, standing up, saying, thank you for finally calling these people out.  It was a good thing. You take that attitude next to Biden. Do you think Biden's going to make anybody feel safe now?  And I don't think so. So the argument I've put forward is, look, man, I'm a moderate person. My politics have always been left leaning, pro-choice, progressive tax, government programs, all this good stuff. I grew up in a city, but I'm not super far left. I need an argument from you. Donald Trump has come forward with the economy was booming, lowest unemployment in 50 years, best numbers of our lives. Up until the pandemic, he instituted a travel ban that they, the Democrats are even agreeing with.  Now, at this point, if you want to convince me to vote for you and many people like me, I think you've got to give me an argument as to why Biden is better. But they're not. They're saying stay alive, Joe Biden. We just don't like Trump.  But they really they really are. They're really doing that. That's a good point.  And I think if the economy does manage to show some signs of resurgence around November in, you know, towards October and September, if he has some sort of a real rock solid plan and he can show you where it's going, this is what we're planning on doing this. We're going to have this by that that by this. And by the way, Joe Biden is not going to get better. His cognitive decline is going to increase. And it could it could drop right off of a fucking cliff.  You might come around to where November is, where the gaffes are constant and they pull him off of the public eye and they never show him.  If the Democrats want to win, they'll run.  Michelle Obama, we might have a fucking CGI Joe Biden with some. I'm not kidding where he does it from some sort of a remote location and they CGI the shit out of his face.  Well, I'll tell you one thing that there's there's some net positive Trump could look at in terms of the pandemic worry. You know, people trust him. His approval rating was going up when they were televising his his his press briefings as soon as they stopped doing approval ratings are going back down. So when people hear what he was saying, they liked it. But the other big factor is if this persists beyond the election, Joe Biden will never debate him.  And we see this in the press right now. Everyone keeps saying it. The more the longer Joe Biden has hidden, the better his campaign is doing because people can't see him struggling to speak.  They're just going against Trump mailing voting. I agree with you about Michelle Obama, but I don't think she really wants to run.  Well, I'm not sure she would either. But I'm saying that's their I think they would win if they ran her. They probably would mail in voting, I think will be the downfall of Republicans if in voting does get pushed through. Nancy Pelosi, I believe she said she wants to have Masland voting confirmed the next stimulus package if the lockdown persists beyond November, November and mail in voting is is the go to the challenge. You see a bunch of Republicans saying that mail and voting could lead to fraud and it can write if somebody's mom is like, you know, old and just like not paying attention and you fill it out for her.  But the bigger issue I see for Republicans is that uninitiated, an uninterested people will be voted for. And that means in big urban areas, you'll have a mom and a dad telling their kids who normally don't care to vote, just fill it out, just fill it out, just vote for the guy. And that could potentially hurt.  I think the real concern is in the counting, the votes, the concern in terms of fraud. Right. Fraud. So the Republicans main concern is fraud, that someone's going to take their kids back and just flat out for form.  Right. But I don't think not just that also in how how it's counted. Right.  Tracking them, they'll be mailbox in the post office en masse. I agree with all that.  You know, I think I think you don't need to go so far as to assume someone's going to snatch up all the ballots. It's possible and replace them. I think that's a bit too much for me. I just think right now we know the youth vote swings left and they don't care about voting. You put the ballot in their house.  They care about voting. They don't they didn't turn out for Bernie. They did not turn out. They turn out in some areas, but they didn't turn out. So you get this very active base online ranting about what they want. They don't actually go out for it, put the boot in their pocket, send it to their mailbox. And the mom says, there it is, fill it out, they're going to do it. And so that's going to make sure the people who normally aren't bothered to go vote will go vote.  Timperley did three hours. Those are not. It's always fun. Thanks for taking the trip. Thanks for driving over here. And Bug out Van is good fun. How long you stay this part of the country program. Leave right away. OK, yeah. Good luck. And maybe people wave to you along the way. Yeah. Do you have photos of the van on the outside where people could see it on Instagram.  I have one. She probably had that one. Delete that one man. Someone's going to come to my van and kick it in. I don't know. That's not what I'm saying.  There's going to. Tattoo your face on their ass or something. Some weird people are weird, man. I had a weird story. I've no way to get to it. Go ahead.  I had a I had a crazy guy show up at my house, pedophile 4:00 in the morning, wanted me to tell a story to call the cops, wanted you to tell him a story, wanted me to tell the world his story about being a pedophile.  I saw him like that about how he was innocent. It wasn't true. So she was at my house at 4:00 am. Try breaking in. So I wake up at 4:00 a.m. to have a gun either and I have a gun. And so I called the police. This is crazy. Police showed up. They catch the guy. They first came. They told me, go home, cops come back, tell me to buy a gun, basically.  Oh, jeez, it's not easy thing to do, but get this. That morning I wake up, it's like nine a.m. and I got woken up at like 4:00 am by this, I think was like three something. And so normally I do a segment first thing in the morning. It airs at 10:00 a.m. And so after dealing with all that, I was like, I am not prepared. I'm just going to tell people what happened and say, don't come to my house.  In the middle of recording my segment, guy comes back. So I check my security camera and I see him there and I'm filming while it's happening. I call the police and I'm like, he's back. And I recorded all of it. And then the cops came and he took off, I guess.  Yeah, I was going to bring it up because we were talking about, you know, the end of the world, the apocalypse, guns, so. It's not easy to get a gun in New Jersey. The cops were like, if it were me, I'd open the door with a shotgun. And I was like, yeah, if I could get one in Jersey.  But you can you just have to wait 10 days. Right now. You got to write an essay. I got to write an essay on why I need it. Yeah, and then you have to be accepted and then they have to approve the essay and they said they said typically takes 30 days, but sometimes can take up to a year.  It's not supposed to take up to a year. That kind of illegal. That's what I was told at the department.  But they don't want to move to Arizona where you could just buy a gun in a grocery store in Virginia. So are you going to go? Oh, I don't know, man. I'm going to leave. I'm I'm going to move out of Jersey. Not really.  Yeah, for sure. So I'm in the Philly area because of this? Partly, yeah.  But also because I want to expand my business. You know, look, I do opinion commentary on news stories, and now it's time to start hiring more people for four straight news and fact checking. So I have a fact checking build out that I've been working on how we're going to rate other agencies. We're going to do a hundred randomly sampled articles and we're going to run them through the SPG and Reuters ethics codes. We're going to look for violations of the ethics codes.  We're going to apply them. So if BuzzFeed News runs a hundred stories and we find that 63 have have some kind of violation of a code of ethics, we give them the score of, you know, 37 out of 100. And then people can see how we write these agencies. And you can look at all the stories so you can look at exactly why we disagreed and we'll highlight where the violation occurred.  That's a great idea.  So I need a building so I can hire people to do it. Beautiful. Well, let me know when that gets up and running. We'll let everybody know. And appreciate you, man. I really appreciate your perspective. I appreciate you the way you look at things.  And it was great to talk to you as a fisherman for sure. Thank you. Bye, everybody.
