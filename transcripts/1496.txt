And this is an easy commercial for me because it is a product that I use every single day. I drink liquid, I've put it into a bottle water and I drink that before I workout. I drink it during my workouts. It's fantastic stuff. And one stick of liquid ivy and 16 ounces of water hydrates you faster and more efficiently than water alone. Each serving provides as much hydration as two to three bottles of water.  Plus you get vitamin C B3, B five B6 and B twelve more vitamin C than an orange and as much potassium as a banana. That's right, bitches. And it's great for you. And it's changed my feeling about hydration and electrolytes because I used to get cramps like I would get them during a workout sometimes or after work since I've been drinking liquid I.V., I don't get it at all anymore.

Good, not just make money, but do good and try to change the world and hydration is so important, folks, dehydration occurs daily in three out of four people. And I know for a fact I went got blood work done like a year ago or so, and they told me I was dehydrated. The doctor did a blood work test and he also did like a body fat analysis and all these different things on me.  And he said, you're dehydrated. Well, dehydration can lead to daily headaches, dizziness, brain fog, muscle fatigue, muscle cramps, which is what I was getting, dry skin and more to try to stay hydrated. But just water alone, you'd have to drink eight full eight ounces or eight ounce glasses of water a day. And thankfully, there's liquid I.V., which is much better and much more efficient. I fucking love it. I drink it every day.  It has the optimum ratio of glucose, sodium and potassium, and they call it their cellular transport technology.

I've had him on the podcast before and I felt like during this time of great unrest, this would be a good time to discuss what is important about the Second Amendment and a very educated person's take on it.  So please welcome Kalayaan Nguoi government podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience Train by Day, Joe Rogan podcast, My Night All Day and we lost a great seat.  Thank you for being here. Appreciate me for this. Just for you. Yeah. And thank you for the gift to men. You're just pandering at this point bro. No, come on man. I do this for you. I had it. I knew I had that. I had to go find it.  My daughter's friend's ex-boyfriend work for Glock.  OK, ok. Yeah. Know how to get your gift man. So it's it's my life pot. It's like my portable say because, you know, out here in California you have to if you're going to travel with the fire. Right. It has to be in a lot case. Right. And so when I travel out here to California, I do bring a firearm with me. I can't carry because, you know, my license isn't working outside here, but I can't keep a gun in my hotel.  What do you have to do? Like Ted Nugent can carry everywhere because he's like a sheriff or something?  Yeah. There's always, you know, you have a little special licenses. Yeah. You got to you got to see the Steven Seagal show, the TV show where he was a cop.  It's like Steven Seagal lawman or some shit.  But it's so I think I was younger one when it came out he was a real cop like he was arresting people. Like you shouldn't have shown up in people's houses. With a gun drawn. Are you fucking Steven Seagal? Hey, man, what's going on here? So it was like a reality show, reality show. This is it right here. Yeah. And he would pull people end because he was in New Orleans. He developed this. Give me some some volume on this.  You get to hear his accent.  Oh, we'll get you kicked off of YouTube if we give us a ball. But you've got to watch on your own. He developed his like says Louisiana stocks. Oh, yes, he did. Oh, yes, he did. Oh, yes, he did.  Oh, yes, he did.  It was me and my friend Tom Cigarette's favorite show would talk to each other about Grace because I grew up watching his foot like he's literally running around.  Yeah, people are ridiculous.  You know, I make fun of that dude all the time and he deserves it.  But he was a legit Akito master back that we're looking for is sitting on the ground right there. Now, that's a normal accent. It varies. It varies widely and wildly depending upon who he's actually talking to. It's a surreal sometimes to be talking to certain folks he'll put on like a deep Louisiana. So how do I open this back?  So right now, is this your brand? Yes.  So basically, I teamed up with this company called Voltaic. That's when you know, you're a real gun nut, you've got your own guns. I think it only made sense. So how do I open this thing? All right. So basically, there isn't a battery in it yet. But what you would do is you see those clamps on the side. Yeah. So you put the clamps on that makes it watertight. OK, and so it's it's a lifestyle case also.  Livestock. Yeah. So like there are people I just did a post where somebody was on a jet ski and he had his like all his valuables and contents in there and he goes, OK. Oh I see. So he dropped in water or anything like that. Oh it says here the people life here get it done. People don't know what the fuck that means. You say Tipu life. Yeah, but people are not going to be not excuse me.  Non. Yeah. No they don't. They don't. They're kind of like what church. You mean like pews in a church. Like what does that mean. Pew. Pew like stinky. Like I wear shirt one time and it was like it was Pew and so what does that mean.  I was like guns like oh Jesus people.  This is one of the reasons why I contacted you.  I contacted you right when the looting hit because that's a racist, you know, because there were a lot of white people looting.  It was a thing where I recognized that there was a giant shift in people's perception of the Second Amendment. And I said, this is a good time for you. Again, appreciate it, brother.  Yeah. Because you're out there beating the drums and sounding the alarms and all these people that are anti Second Amendment people where a lot of these motherfuckers that were lined up in California trying to buy a gun last minute, because as soon as the lockdown hit, people started getting really nervous when people started getting locked in their homes.  And then people when they realized they weren't going to work, people started to worry about people stealing and things along those lines. I heard about people getting carjacked and or get their groceries jacked rather well. They headed to their car from the grocery store. Things got real weird.  And then you saw these giant lines at these L.A. gun stores. And that's when I got a hold, because I think it's very it's a really important conversation. I think you're the best at explaining it from a very rational perspective that, you know, people in during the times before covid, they didn't think that this was important.  Yeah, but you were always one of those guys where I was like, hey, what if shit goes down? Yeah, well, guess what, shit went down.  It's kind of like me carrying a firearm. You know, a lot of people ask me, they're like when I start carrying a gun, I'm like, why? Why do you need the gun? Like, what do you think you are, a drug dealer or something?  I'm like, look, it's nothing for me to take my my, my, my phone's, my wallet, my keys and then put my gun on and go about my life. It's nothing for me. Normal. Yeah.  And it's not much of a it's not much of an encumbrance on my life where it's like, OK, it's not worth the day to day of me carrying a firearm, but if I ever needed it, that's going to be the most important thing I have on me to protect that life.  So it's it's a small price to pay for something that has such a huge upside if it ever happens.  Yeah. You're a best case scenario, though. You're your lawyer.  You're super intelligent. You're a really nice guy, but you also love guns. Yes. Look, what people are worried about is worst case scenario. They're worried about someone who's a criminal, who just wants to rob people, who has this ultimate power over folks. And that's what everybody's worried about when it comes to guns. They're worried about a school shooter. You know, they're worried about a mass murderer. They're worried about a guy who breaks into a mosque and starts going to people down.  That's what they're worried about.  And I totally get it. Yeah. Like, I really, truly, honestly get it. I know empathize and sympathize with that. But my whole thing is this.  Once we move past that understanding of so, you know, you have the best case scenario. What you pointed out was directly me, so to speak. And then you have the worst case scenario where you have, you know, criminals, you have crazy people, mass shooters, things of that nature once we get out of that realm. So let's talk about the reality, because, you know, there's overlaps, right? So I usually ask people, well, what law you're going to come up with, that's going to completely stop that.  No one knows. Now, I'm not saying that because I have the absolute answer, but what I can tell you is this if we don't know what law we can come up with, that's going to completely stop that. Because you can say ban. You can ban all the guns tomorrow. You're still going to have crime. You still going to have those crazy people doing those same things. We have 300 million over 30 million guns in this country not going anywhere.  You can ban them from law abiding citizens and we'd have to deal with that as it comes. But at the end of the day, criminals are still going to get their hands on guns. And so what you have to understand and accept is from a reality standpoint, if you know that when all the barriers at a place to prevent these things don't work, the only person that's going to be able to do anything about it is you. And you want the best thing possible at your disposal to contend against that.  And that's that's what the firearm does. I'm do I glorify firearms to a degree? Yes. But that's because I'm a firearm enthusiast. I love them from a very practical scientific engineering. Exactly. And even from a sports entertainment, all of those things. Right. It's very holistic in that regard. But for people who are just understanding it from a practical perspective, like, OK, from self-defense.  If that's the only box you want to live in, that makes this perfectly fine with me, I just have a problem where people say things like, well, no one needs to have a firearm, but then you're perfectly aware of all the violence and everything else that goes on in this country. And you understand the limitations of the of the first responders that we have in place to be able to prevent it.  And if you understand that, theoretically speaking, you're on your own, and I don't mean that from the very sadistic kind of, you know, no way out kind of perspective, but it's just reality, reality cases. And we just learned and we're learning it now with the whole covid situation. Yeah. You're on your own.  Well, not just covid. Right. Like, how about I have my friend John Joseph. He lives in New York City and in New York City.  There's there's a lot of cops are quitting and there's a lot of crazy shit going on. He sent me a text message. He has a buddy that works in Harlem as a cop.  And he said there was 28 shootings in one night, which is just fuckin bonkers.  And this guy is he said and this is New York. Yes. Is a Harlem. So he sent me this is the list of all the shootings that he sent me. This is his his buddies, 21 years old, and he's working in in Harlem.  Keep keep in mind, New York has by far some of the strictest gun. It's literally one of the only places that when I travel to, I will not bring a gun.  Yeah, I was going to bring that up. And then the other one I was going to bring up in Chicago, which is very similar in McCard. Yeah.  And there's a there's a running total online.  There's a website that shows all the shootings in Chicago in it's fucking bonkers like I mean, just look at what just happened on Father's Day. I think it was like 102 people shot. Yeah, that's fucking ridiculous. Fucking crazy.  And here's his thing about that, too. There's there's a consistency and a pattern behind these types of shootings. It's not even like so usually when you deal with a problem, first thing you do is you try to look for a pattern and see if you can figure figure out a pattern. So you try to solve it. Yeah. And you see, OK, what what's the common denominator of all these things? And then it you can figure out start to figure out why it happens.  The idea that we're going to create laws that's going to stop something that's so centralized and it's so it's it's there's a fundamental cause for the types of violence that we're talking about right now, because they're happening very specific areas of our country.  This isn't widespread, right? It's not like it's like we just have this mass violence across the country. On the contrary, violence on crime is actually going down. If you look at it from a statistical standard. However, there are pockets within our country that have this violence and there's consistencies within that.  One of the big ones being gun laws, not no gun laws, extreme poverty. OK, you know what I'm saying?  Because a lot of it is is our inner cities, because if you think about it, some people like to even place it based upon race. Right. And it's like, OK, well, this is a black on black violence issue. Yeah, I can understand that. But however, if you really think about it, think about some of the most affluent black neighborhoods in the country. We don't have those problems. Right. So what poverty is exactly.  And it's also an issue of in Chicago in particular, I took a ride once.  I had a guy was driving us, was a former cop, and he was saying that they arrested a bunch of the high level drug dealers and they created a power vacuum. And then it started this crazy war. And this war is just in he's like, no one knows how to get out of it. No one knows what to do about it. This is why South Side Chicago to this day is one of the scariest spots in the entire country.  I've done, too. When I was with the NRA, I did two two episodes and south side of Chicago. Are you not with the NRA anymore? No. No, I'm not.  How come they're the NRA and their ad agency of record had a falling out, massive falling out. I was basically collateral damage within that. So for whatever reason, after the falling out, I haven't had contact with the NRA for almost a year.  So were you working for them? I yeah, pretty much.  Pretty much. In terms of as much as, say, Don Lemon works for CNN.  OK, we haven't really works for CNN. They give him a fat check with that question to me. Well, I don't I don't get down limit. I didn't wasn't getting unlimited money. But essentially what I was doing was I was a commentator and I was a host of my of two shows on their platform. OK, that's the extent a lot of people thought I wasn't actually still a member of the NRA.  Yeah, I'm still a member of the NRA. Yeah, OK. I thought maybe you had a falling out with the way the organization was, right?  No, no. It's just radio silence right on there. Oh yeah. It's kind of weird. I the way I function, I just keep, I just keep moving. That's what I do. Smart. Yeah. So from that perspective. So there's no on my part, there's no there's no bad blood. I may have some critiques about certain things, but other than that there's no bad blood.  Have you noticed a big uptick in people interested in your message. Yes. Yeah, yeah.  Especially a lot of people who are buying guns for the first time. Like, I'm pretty sure you're getting to.  Yeah, a lot of people. Asking if they can buy a gun. Yeah, and then they get a first class lesson about how the laws work. Yeah, yeah. They're also like people in California that wanted to go buy a gun. They realized it takes a long time and gives you a background check. There's a wait period. And a funny thing that I used to get the biggest pushback from my defense of not having a waiting period for firearms.  I used to get I used to get a lot of pushback from that because people were like, well, at least, you know, give people time to calm down and cool off. I mean, that's that's that's cartoon land thinking. Somebody who's made a decision to kill somebody, they're going to kill them or at least going to make an attempt to do so. Maybe the idea that that somehow not being able to buy a gun immediately to commit that crime, I personally don't think it does anything.  I don't I think if I'm if I've set out to commit some crime against someone and I go try to get a gun and I can't get a gun, I'm going to try to find another avenue by which to get that tool that I need to commit that crime. And so I however, on in the alternative, I can tell you actual stories about people trying to get firearms who needed them immediately but couldn't get them and thus probably died as a result of it.  And so and I and I know other people, people I've had held I've had girlfriends in the past who have dealt situations with stalkers who were like, OK, I need I need a gun for tonight because this person showed up at my house, you know, things like that.  Don't you think that in order to safely you want to make sure that someone is not a dangerous, violent felon before you sell him a gun? Absolutely. So there's got to be some kind of background check. And we have them, right?  Yeah, but how long do you think you don't want to wait, period? No, I'm against the wait period.  And what is so the logic is if like say if a woman knows that a guy is stalking her and might show up at her house tonight, she wants to be able to have a gun. Absolutely. That makes sense to me. But there's still going to be a background check on that girl.  Yes. So so so if she were not. So let's let's kind of flesh that out, OK? So right now, if you go and buy a gun from a dealer, right. Someone who has a license to sell firearms as a business, you have to have a background check. Right. And the background checks instant. But I think a lot of people misconstrue the fact that the background check is instant as being insufficient. OK. And that's not the case.  It's just that we live in a technical we have technology now. So it allows us to conduct a background check a lot quicker than we probably would 30, 40 years.  Yeah, I bought my first gun in 94 and the background check is like by Poni, you know, I don't know how they did it back then, but it took a while.  It's a lot of paperwork to make sure you're not a criminal. But, you know, there was no Internet. Yeah, exactly. Yeah. And so now with the Internet, I mean, it's it's pretty pretty quick. Yeah. I think what people are having a problem with is private transactions. Right. Right. And so generally speaking, in most states, you don't you're not required to force someone to get a background check if you were going to sell them a gun.  Like, if you're in the business of selling guns, then that's one thing. But if you're like, hey, Joe, you want to go in and say you want to tell you you saw one of my guns and you're like, hey, I want to buy that gun right in Texas. I can I can meet with you as long as I know you're not a felon or have reason to know that you're a felon or prohibit a person of some sort, I can tell you the gun so you don't have to do any kind of check.  No, that's interesting.  Now. I'm at liberty to say, hey, Joe, how about you meet me at this gun store and pay for background check on top of the price of the gun and then have it back and then conduct a background check, which a lot of people do, a lot of people this and so.  But but you don't have I don't like the idea that I don't like the idea of mandating private background checks. Right.  So, like, if you had a friend and she had a stalker and the stock was going to break in her house, you could legally sell her a gun in Texas right there.  And then she could take I can just give her as long as give a gun, as long as I like I said, as long as I don't know or have reason to know that she's a prohibitive, prohibitive person. Other than that. Yeah.  Again, again, I bring this back to you. Our best case scenario, like for a guy like you to have a gun, I don't worry about you having a gun at all. I think, you know, what I'm worried about is, again, people that are psychotic, people that are on medication, people that are dangerous, people that are criminals, people that are thugs. That's what everybody's worried about. Yeah, as am I. Yeah, as are you.  And when you're talking about giving your friend a gun again, that that seems completely reasonable. You're a reasonable person. I know that if you're going to give a gun to a person and you think they need it, this is going to be a well thought out decision.  Yeah, absolutely. So the alternative, the contrary to that is what the idea that somebody who's not like that will just be giving guns away to people.  Right. To describing someone who's unscrupulous. That's the worry right now. Worry is someone who, you know, wants to make a buck and they'll sell guns to felons.  Yeah. And that's already illegal. Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's illegal, right?  It doesn't matter if you make a look. You yo, what happened? The government didn't want us fucking around. You want to talk too much shit does the anti-gun lobby and they blew a fuse technically my audio recording back.  Oh, so the video shut off. Shall we pause for a second here? It's the Russians or the Chinese. Who do you think the darkness, that one's gone? The video's going I. We're going to hold hold, folks, hopefully nothing will happen here and they won't think that everything else. Everything like what imag. OK, well, let's turn everything back on just in case, we'll just pause, ladies and gentlemen, something happened. There was some sort of a power surge, so we're just pausing for security.  We'll come back in a moment. All right.  We're back. So something happened, folks. Sorry. We had some sort of a power surge. All the lights went out for a second and pop back on. It was like a pop. You know, we don't know what. Never have that happen before.  It's the fucking Russians or the Chinese or the, I don't know, millions.  I've been up, but I've been having some weird things happen on my own, so I wouldn't be surprised.  Yeah, that was I was going to ask you that.  Do you feel like because you have this pro Second Amendment message, do you think people fuck with you because like you're like if I was someone who had an anti Second Amendment message, you're the biggest nightmare.  A lawyer who's a friendly guy, good looking, articulate, really good at media. You're always doing things and you have a passion for these guns. You talk about them like you did.  This thing where you're walking around is a bunch of tires around you, like, smile, God, I love this guy and you're shooting it and you're talking like that motherfucker loves guns.  Like, this isn't a joke, but you love guns the way I love muscle cars or bows or you know, you're I mean, most guns, too. You know what?  You know, it's funny thing is, you know what I love slightly more than guns.  What cars do you. Yeah. What kind of cars I'm more into, like the vanity superficial level cars like like Aston's Ferraris, Porsches and things of that nature. Yeah. That's my that's my that's my my heart really. Thorp's. Yeah.  I'm into cars that make me feel. Yeah.  Like I feel like, like manual transmissions, you know. I consider it so my my favorite brand is Aston Martin. It's a great car. And so I consider that the English muscle car because largely they are they all this and effects that you get from an American muscle car, generally speaking, with a little bit more refinement you get from Aston Martins, but then they also go wrong and they also lose value incredibly. Yeah.  So the go wrong car, Dane Cook was telling me about that. He said he had an Aston Martin. It fell apart. But my friend Bernard Shaw has one right now and he loves it. Which one do you know?  What is that? It's dope. Whatever it looks like a spaceship. It's pretty slick.  I love them. And they they evoke an emotional response out of me more than any other generally speaking, any other car.  It's British. Yeah. I don't trust British. I don't trust my people. Italians can fuck off. I'm never buy one of your cars, you fucking animals.  My people are supposed to make pizza and paintings.  That's supposed to be making cars, man. They have a lot of character rather. Oh yeah they do. Yeah. No, I love Ferraris. They are gorgeous.  I mean I'm so stupid I might buy one one day. I think it should be that stupid.  Yeah. No I'm good. They, they do man.  The funny thing is I'm not even like a I mean like I remember I went to exotic racing in Vegas so yes. Like my first time ever driving race car around driving a car around the track like that. And I've got to drive pretty much anything. I want it in the car I walked away from that was like I mean, anywhere from like a Ferrari Pista to a 9/11 GT three. And the car that I walked away from, like, yeah, it was actually the Porsche 911.  Yeah.  We're talking about a three to four hundred thousand dollar car versus a hundred and thirty one hundred fifty thousand dollar car.  Yeah. The G3 evokes an emotional response because of this, the interaction that you have with the vehicle.  Was it a manual or was it wasn't a man who was there at PDK? Well, if you want to drive fast, the PDK is the way to go.  The manuals really better for a streetcar. Yes.  You know, when you're on a track, you want to keep your hands on the wheel and just bang bang so you don't mischiefs in the nature.  But yeah, when you are on the street, that level of engagement between shifting gears and a car, it you can't there's nothing that can. Only thing I think that may be able to replicate that to a degree is working the bolt action on arrival. And I know it's I see what you're saying.  Yeah, I see what you're saying. Yeah. There's a yeah. Or even like or even like a lever action like that.  That same thing is this just like this. It's like a combination of the mechanical and organic that just kind of comes together and it's just beautiful.  Do you know that in the hunting world there's like a dispute between the hunting world and the tactical world and the gun enthusiast world, and they call it the hunting world fun.  Yeah, they fight like meaning Elmer. Fuck. Yeah. And what's ironic is the new Warner Brothers, they cut out the gun. There's a new remake of Elmer FUD. Now, this is where it gets crazy, folks. Elmer FUD, who's always been hunting Bugs Bunny, now he's hunting Bugs Bunny with a size which is so boring as shit.  It's the Eagles. And you're like, it literally made me go, Oh, shit.  Like if Elmer shoots Bugs Bunny with a shotgun, at least he dies quick. You're hacking away, man.  You're just what? And he still allowed to use dynamite. They're still using dynamite. So they're using explosives, but they can't use a firearm anymore.  I actually did a video on it. Did you? Yeah. Yeah. And one of the riders basically said is justification for it was, you know, during the. And they were working on the actual cartoon, it happened really close to the Vegas shooting, and so they, like everyone in media, wanted to stay away from God. So I'm like, but the syphoned explosions are OK.  Look at this. Give me give me a play. Some of this. Just take a look at it. Can you just have it in the background? Just like I just want to see what this looks like, what he's running around the site.  Oh, there's something weird, man, about redoing the past, you know, Looney Tunes. So this is a new version, right? This is completely new. It's not like they took the gun out. Oh, my God.  This is so, so weird that it's so sick.  And he sticks a stick of dynamite in his mouth. And he blows his fucking face off. That's OK. I mean, what is, first of all, what kind of fucking shitty dynamite I know we're teaching.  That's the worst lesson you're teaching kids. No dynamite safety because dynamite just makes your face dirty for a second. And then and then it comes back to normal.  Look, even his hat regenerates, like, what the fuck are we teaching kids?  There's no consequences to Dinham. There is a gratuitous use of dynamite in this one. Look at this. But look at how crazy is that. Dynamite blows his hat apart, but then it fixes it within seconds.  I look at this boom and again, boom and again, boom and again, boom. This is a bit excessive. But look, he lands. Oh, finally his hat fucked up. Well, it's fucked up. Let's see. Let's see. It's fucked up.  He's dancing and it's going to be back.  Oh, he's got no hat. Boom. Then he gives him a cake with dynamite and it says, coming soon, that is the dumbest shit of my life. God, that's so weird.  I think it would've been ten times better with a gun, but it doesn't make any sense. It's so weird.  But I I'm not much of a conspiracy theorist. I'm not. Sometimes I like I look at stuff like that and I look at the decision behind why they removed the firearm.  And I hear you the whole Vegas thing. And, you know, there's a sensitivity to it. But I'm like, but what's your alternative? Was just as or if not more violent, then then the gun. So my mind goes, OK, this is more of a cultural thing, right? I think I think there's an attempt to be made to be raised the idea of firearm ownership in this country, because I think there are large a lot lot of people like me, like we grew up, even though I didn't grow up with firearms, I still grew up with an understanding of the Second Amendment.  I was I was taught about the second movement to a certain degree in school. I guarantee you, they're not teaching about second movement schools. Now know that. I can assure, you know.  Yeah. If anything, I mean, there's definitely no positive message. No.  So what it tells me is I'm assuming the demographic of people that are going to be watching that are large.  It would be largely you and I who kind of grew up with it in the past for the nostalgia effect. But then also a new generation of kids are going to be watching that as well. And we all grew up with Elmo, Fred, having the shotgun. Yeah, yeah. He's the hunter with the shotgun and he's very quiet.  I'm hunting wabbits. But see, here's a funny thing about that. You know, when it comes to the the issue of firearms and we in the gun debate in this country, by and large, you get people like Joe Biden talking about, you know, all you need is a shotgun. You don't you don't need an AR15 shotgun shack. Who needs a A15 for hunting yet? You Castor's Elmer FUD and you take away his shotgun.  What does that what does that say? Well, it doesn't make any sense, it doesn't it doesn't make any sense. Joe Biden's message doesn't make any sense either, because shotguns have a very limited range.  You know, it's also it's it's you know, if someone's like on your property, breaking in and shooting at you from a distance or something, it's not going to do much of anything.  But I think that's the point. It's well, it's also like it's not true that people don't hunt with them. People will hunt with arrows all the time, particularly pigs.  Yeah, that's a that's another debate in the hunting world about bolt action versus semiautomatic. And that, you know, especially when people pigs like in Texas, you're dealing with massive pig infestation. And when they hunt these wild pigs, they like to use guns. They could fire more than one round.  There's a video of me right now on on YouTube where I was hunting. I was hunting hogs at night with an are. Yeah. And and the funny thing is a lot of it, too, for me.  I mean, we have cougars in Texas, so people don't think about that component, so I may be hunting one animal, but there may be another animal to me. Exactly. And I don't want to have to deal with the bolt action rifle, possibly deal with that threat. Fuck that. Right.  Like, I was I knew I was in New Mexico not too long ago and I was just kind of one of my friends has a huge property out there called Cookie Ranch. And I was driving around his property and just kind of exploring a little bit. And I took an acre with me because he does have bears and things like that on his property.  I don't want to run or I don't want to run into something that could kill me with with a bolt action. Yeah, I want to A.R. because it's effective at allowing me to defend myself more effectively. Yeah. And I think that's where other people a lot of people don't realize that. They just see the they see the arrow and they say, oh my God, it looks scary, it looks dangerous. And I assume what a bad guy can do with an eye toward you.  They never really see themselves in power to utilize the air to defend themselves. And I think that's the way they want the conversation to be in this country, is to perpetually see yourself as a possible victim. Now, the irony is, to a degree, I'm doing the same thing. I'm saying having they are so in the event that somebody tries to make you a victim, you can defend yourself. Right. The only difference is one of one of the conclusive aspects of what I'm saying is empowering.  The other is depend on me and give me and put all of your safety in my hands, i.e. via the government. Right. And I'm just not with that.  Well, and also we're realizing that the people that you put your hands into there, they're humans and they're severely flawed. Yeah, I mean, that's what we're realizing across the entire country right now.  And that's what the people forget.  I think people tend to add this kind of autonomous, godlike aspect to the government. Well, we'd like that to be the case, like the government, to be the big daddy that's going to if we dial 911 one, they're going to take care of everything. Yeah, but honestly, that's probably not the case. What's not the case right now in Atlanta here? What's going on? Atlanta cops are just not responding.  Yeah, and that's a huge, huge reality, though. Yeah. We got a lot of messages from people. I got a lot of messages from cops that think that I had a bad take on the Atlanta case because the guy stole the he stole a Taser and then they shot him.  And they you know, what they were saying to me is essentially that this guy had a criminal history and that just because someone is being compliant doesn't necessarily mean that they don't have evil intentions. They're just they're just waiting to do something. And then this guy got in a tussle with the cop.  I understand what they're saying, but given the current climate shooting, a guy with a Taser, that doesn't work, you know, because that's Jamy. That's the case, right? The Taser didn't work. That's that's what I had read.  Yes. That they said had already been fired twice. So that means it's done.  Do we know that for a fact? That's what I read. Can we pull that up just in case? Because we are talking on a podcast that millions of people are going to hear.  I don't want anybody to misunderstand me. I, I have two positions. One, I think. It's really hard to be a cop really, really, really fucking hard to be a cop, and I think the defunding of the cops is a terrible idea. I think they need way more money and I think they need training. And I had JoCo Willingdon, who's a former Navy SEAL, and he was a commander. And he would he would set up testing and he would set up training, rather.  And that's what they need. They need constant training. Jocke was saying he thinks they should be training 20 percent of the time.  Yeah, I mean, I honestly probably trained a lot more than a lot of cops. I bet you trained way more than most cops. And then I would always be really shocked in jujitsu class when cops would come in where they were.  They had nothing experience and nothing like they literally didn't know what to do in a hand-to-hand fighting, like, man, this is crazy. Yeah. Here goes. We have concluded that Rauf was aware that the Taser and Brooks possession, it was fired twice. Once, it's fired twice. It presented no danger to him or to other persons.  OK, one thing you could say is that maybe he forgot that is possible, that he forgot he saw the Taser being pointed at him. But it also says he shot him in the back two times he was running away from them.  So the part the shooting I think the shooting in the back is not as relevant as people make it, he says.  Howard's office concluded the time of Brooks death. He did not pose a threat to the officers. He said Brooks was running away from the officers when when Ralph shot him in the back two times that that I agree with the shooting in the back.  I don't think this is as important because people move well.  Also there in the video, from what I saw now, it could be wrong. But correct me if they see this.  When I saw him in the video, he was turning back and shooting like this. Oh.  So it makes it stands to reason that they be firing on him. He's going to get hit in the back. Right.  But if they knew that the Taser had been fired twice, that's a different story.  If you can prove that he knew the Taser, if he for me, you can prove that the Taser, you can prove that he had knowledge that it was a Taser that had already been fired and was inoperable at that point.  Then, yeah, then we're talking and I was aware of it.  When was a panic.  Right. They really do. There's things that happen to people in high pressure situations that you you can't attribute normal thinking to them in high pressure situations.  I've had somebody also because I've had multiple conversations. So when stuff like this comes out, I don't I hadn't I haven't talked about this because I don't think it's a gun issue. So I don't talk about it on my channel. I understand. But I do have these conversations and, you know, personally and so I talk to different people who I know will have different perspectives.  One thing somebody pointed out to me was the idea that, like you talked about in the moment, with the adrenaline being pumped and then you have the tunnel vision, all that stuff that's going on, there is a sort of kind of a reactive nature to hearing the sound of pop going off and then a cop possibly thinking that he's shooting a gun.  That was that's that's when there is so does the Taser pop, even though it had been fired twice from where I'm from, when I'm told it does, it'll still pop.  It may not be effective or disperse anything, but it'll still make the noise. Yeah. Oh, well, there you go. And so I think that changes things if that if that happened. But still, I know in the current climate, it's just it's yeah.  There's a there's a it's hard man because he's like, you're right. It's like do we now expect the cops to be politicians as well?  Well, we also expect them to be superhuman in their ability to function under pressure with very little training.  That's not a real problem.  And that's a huge problem that I think a lot of people don't realize. A lot of people think that cops are just these these wizards with firearms and a lot of them or not. And a lot of it is due to the fact that a lot of these departments don't have enough money to train them adequately. Exactly. Yeah. It's only like cops that I know personally.  They go I go to courses, training courses, and these cops are they're paying for it themselves. Yeah. It's not even like, you know, like that, like the the department sent them there or they're subsidizing their training, although they're by themselves paying for the paying their own money to go to these training courses so that they can be more proficient and better at firearm handling, safety, so forth and so on.  So when I was going to have two positions, my one position is that I think cops need way better training.  I think it just it should be a higher priority for us to have like elite people, like Navy SEAL caliber people as police officers and people that are trained to diffuse situations and people are trained and also people that live in the community and people that have a relationship with people in the community so that there's more of an investment.  I do. You better do me one better. I say the entirety of our nation needs to be better trained on firearms. We have over 300 million guns in this country. There's absolutely no reason why we should have so many people not versed and have the knowledge necessary to own and operate a firearm safely.  So you're one of those people, like a well armed society is a polite society? Yes, I am. Yeah, there's an argument for that.  And the alternative is what? Right. You know what I mean?  It's we are a well-armed society. But I think we need to be better educated. Yeah, and I think the time we spend on the national stage arguing and debating gun control, we have three we have over 300 federal gun laws on the books. We have over 22000 on a state and local levels. We've passed the point of gun control laws solving these issues. I think where we're at now is the same way we want to teach kids about sex at a certain age.  We because it's a it's inevitable. It's the same thing with firearms. You're going to interact. You're going to come across a gun at some point in your life in this country.  And so as a result of that, we should be talking about, all right, maybe maybe we subsidize the idea of mass distribution of knowledge with respect to firearms and teaching people to be responsible gun owners so as to create a culture that looks at firearms, one from under the guise of the Second Amendment, but also knowing how to operate them safely and responsibly.  It's so funny because people are in this they have this contradiction right there. Part of them does not want that because they don't want to encourage firearms because they think that will create more firearms.  But I see your point, too, that it would the firearms already exist, and at least this will give people an understanding of the safe way to use them, the proper way to use them. Yeah, I mean, many people have guns and they've never been fired.  Exactly. And I think about all of the new gun owners now. Think about all the people who went out and panic. But I don't like saying it, but it's true. Yeah, they went out and they panic. Panic bought a gun that they really don't know how to use. Yeah.  And so now it's like, so who but see who has to pick up that slack us in the gun community. Right.  So now people like me and other content creators are now we're we're scrambling, trying to create videos to teach people what they need to be doing in order to use and operate their firearm safely.  Because right now we have a culture in a society that is so anti-gun, we rather try to scare people away from guns instead of teaching them how to use them safely, even though we have a Second Amendment which allows us to own and operate these firearms.  That's so crazy and so and so crazy that you people have to go to your Instagram page to be educated in how to.  But but there's good in that, too, because you do have a large following on Instagram and a lot of people are going to go and they're going to learn some things from those videos.  If I'm not Shadowman, are you are you sure?  Yeah, I get mad, brother. It's it's bad. And then I can tell you about my business partner here right now.  We talk about that telling you saw what the numbers were before in terms of who we were able to reach and what they are now.  Hmm. Hmm. That's ugly. Yeah, that's weird too. It's weird because it's like you're not doing anything illegal.  Everything is responsible, everything is intelligent. And you're you're clearly well educated on the subject. Bolton the arguments against gun use in the Second Amendment and also the correct way to use them.  Let me play devil's advocate against myself, OK, because it is based on something you said could very well be the fact that they may they may see that aspect of me. Right. Right.  And other people like me, but they don't have the same faith in other people.  You get what I'm saying, so they don't want the information disseminated out there to those people who they feel may not be as safe.  I think you're thinking of it too kindly. What I think is there's a left wing perspective on guns. Guns, equal, bad. Yes.  Not that I'm aware of. Yeah, I'm just trying to go. Are guns bad? All those guns equally bad?  You know, I mean, this is just it's a really unfair and I was told that, too, when I put up some videos from and tactical people like, oh, are you going to a travel ban, like, really for responsible use of guns in a place where they taught John Wick?  You would think that would not be the case. But now do I think you're in danger of being shot a man? No, because that's not what that's not what you're channel or, you know, your mind is is about firearm ownership. Not to not to mention I was the guy who was part of the NRA who was with the NRA at some point. So that doesn't give me any brownie points in that regard.  But by and large, yes, I am that if you take a look at now, things have gotten a little bit better, but I don't think it's downticks from them loosening things.  I think it's more people are sharing my content because there's nothing the algorithm can do about that. Right. If you see a video and you share it, there's nothing they can do about it.  Well, let's tell everybody your your your Instagram handle right now. If you're honest about Mr. Kohli on the war, Scioli on A.I. are OK. Yeah.  And so let everybody know if you like. How do I get to. You don't have to search literally underwater. Just Google it in the polls because everything. Yeah.  And because some people might be just on this clip and go where I want to go back and listen to the whole bunker.  It's it sucks man.  It sucks because it is a legal thing and you have a real like look, if anybody has a legitimate, intelligent argument for the pros of gun ownership and and, you know, ethical use of guns and. Correct. It's you. I mean, you're the best at it. You're online.  We would go back to probably the reason why they would probably want to shut me up to it's I don't like when people are telling other people what to and not to do.  And it's based on their own personal ideology. I don't like it.  I don't like it at all either, because I'm very much of look, you do what you want to do with your life as long as it doesn't interfere with mine or step on any of my my rights.  We're good.  How Texas of you, Texas through or through Texan born and raised. Yeah, yeah.  It's a great place. So that's this is my two positions that I was saying before. So No one position. I am 100 percent in favor of law enforcement and I think they need to be better trained. And I think you need to get rid of those bad motherfuckers. I think there's a lot of them. I think there's a lot of bad cops that need to get rid of those.  And I got to get this off because this is something that pisses me off a little bit. That is a nuance perspective, however, on social media and in general, the idea of having a nuanced perspective on a particular issue is so far gone now. Yes. That you can't even really have a conversation. I can say in one breath, I am ProComp. Yes, I am ProComp. I have a lot of friends who are cops. However, there are also a good number of them who are evil as fuck, probably racist and need to be fucking dissolved from that.  From sociopaths, psychopaths, murderers. Yes. And for some reason it's either not either all cops are bad or they're all good. And that's what I can't get down with.  Yeah, I just can't you can't get down with that and I'm with you. I think we can also say in one breath, I'm pro cop, but I'm also pro these peaceful protests. Yeah, I think these peaceful protests are important.  And there was some I mean, maybe I did a bad job of explaining what I was trying to say, but whatever basketball player was mad at me the other day because something I said that I think a lot of these people are fighting like an invisible enemy when they're protesting. What I mean by that is, yes, we need bad cops. Yes, cops should stop shooting, whether it's black people or white people or anybody for the wrong reasons.  People, because people love to remember our last our last segment. We made a mistake verbally and people jumped on it. You said we need bad cops. Did I say that? Yeah.  It's not really matter dumb, but we need bad cops. We need cops. We need good cops. But there there's definitely bad cops and bad cops that shoot people. Whatever race they are are fucking terrible. Clearly, there's a problem with cops shooting black people. Clearly, there's also statistically not even just shooting people.  If if you look at it, see if you look at the death statistics for cops and black people, there's a thing that people like to do where they say, well, actually, cops shoot more white people than black people. There are more white people.  Yeah, black people.  And the other thing that I think is as important, if not more important, is cops are physical with black people more than they are white people. Cops are physical with brown people, Mexicans, Puerto Ricans.  They're physical with them more than they are white people statistically by as much or more than twenty five percent. There is a problem. Also, there's a problem with people that don't know what they want. They just think that getting defunding the cops are bad. This is what I meant by fighting an invisible enemy. I just did a shitty job of explaining it.  The thing we should want is a safe community, including people that get pulled over by cops.  So that's the one thing that needs to be addressed first. Right. Get rid of the bad cops, fund them better, train them better. And we should we should all want this. This shouldn't just defund the cops. Shit, it's crazy.  I think a lot of this movement has been co-opted by. And I always, always hesitate because I like I said, I'm not a conspiracy theorist, but I have to call a spade a spade. There are a lot there are a lot of subversive. There's a subversive group in this country that wants to topple the current structure of the United States so that they can gain power because they think they can rule better.  Yeah, and a lot of those people, generally speaking, are Marxist. Yes, that's pretty much it.  That's why I like I make a delineation when people ask me about Black Lives Matter, for instance, Black Lives Matter, the sentiment I can get down with Black Lives Matter, the organization I cannot.  And why is that? Because they are not for the same thing.  So what do you think the leader, the founders of black men like the founders of Black Lives Matter is literally just came out and basically said she's a trademark. She basically said she said blatantly she's a trained Marxist. Both of them, the founders of Black Lives Matter, the organization. These are the same folks that went on stage with Bernie Sanders at one time, I believe. So don't quote me on that and took the mike from whoever the two women are who are who were the founders of Black Lives Matter, the organization.  They are trained Marxist, said it with their own mouth on the show. And so what is their goal?  What do they want or what do Marxist want?  They want to topple the current structure that utilize they have they have their use, so to speak, their use useful idiots, that they create chaos to topple whatever structures in place so that they can come in, fill the vacuum. And then what did they do with the useless what did they do with the useful idiots? They dispose of them because they are rebellious in nature and thus will topple the power structure that's in place then.  So that's where the useful idiots that you think they are utilizing, the people running around spraying black lives matters while rioting and looting. Yes, not protesting. Right, but rioting and looting. That's the distinction. And this is what I did a shitty job explaining. There's a lot of people that are out there protesting, and I don't necessarily think they understand what like what needs to be done. What needs to be done to keep us safe is not defunding the police.  Maybe they need to go through the fucking police department with a fine tooth comb.  And every one of these motherfuckers, it has multiple complaints. Just get rid of them. Yeah, just get rid of find out what the fuck is going on. If the multiple complaints don't make sense, then leave them alone. Yeah, but find out like that guy that the guy that killed that guy. And look for anybody who could do that to a person who can lean on a person's neck, that, for instance, someone's fucking around you, something's fucking wrong with you.  And you should have never been a cop in the first place. And we all know that there are people like that. When you talk to people that are in the military, there are folks that they have to work with that are fucking sociopaths.  And they hope that buds training and that SEAL training is going to weed those guys out of the ranger training or whatever, whatever the fuck it is they have to do. But it doesn't it doesn't always and sometimes they get in a situation.  And JoCo was talking about how you'll get an entire SEAL team that they have to disband and reach and reset up because they have bad leadership.  And so you did the same guys and they come in with good leadership and they get trained correctly and it turns around and it turns out, you know, look, look, if we if we join some sort of a military group and you're being led by some fucking piece of shit, Commander, what do you do?  Where do you go in your faith in the entire organization is fucked up.  So a lot of this stuff is top down. So you have a lot of these cops that are in these bad neighborhoods and they've been dealing with corruption for there's a there's a movie called The Seventy Five, and it's about the 75th Precinct in New York. And Michael Dowd, who is one of the guys in the movie, was a bad cop. Yeah. And he's out now and he did time and shit like that, but it's a fucking crazy movie.  And I had him on the podcast. But his first day on the job, did they throw a dude off a balcony or some shit like that? He was told to shut his mouth. Something happened like first day on the job.  He he witnessed some crazy shit. And they were he was basically told, hey, motherfucker, this is how we do shit. I get all that fucking goody two shoes dragnet bullshit out of your head. This is how we do things here. And so then you're indoctrinated into this force that's already compromised.  And I think that's where a lot of people kind of that's why I think a lot of people come from when they talk about the systemic aspect. Yes. Yes.  It's it's that culture that breeds them mentality that says, all right, this is the way things are going to be done.  So you either you either either get out or you lay down. Right. Right. And saw that. And so in a lot of that, that responsibility is borne on the leadership in these places. Yes. And that's what needs to happen. There needs to be a restructuring and reorganization of the leadership from a top down perspective that I do believe and I agree with you, I'm like, you got a guy who has multiple multiple complained to me at a certain point where there's smoke, there's probably gonna be some fire somewhere.  Yes. And so at that point, if you can't really reasonably justify why this person is getting a lot of complaints and like you said, if it doesn't make sense why they're going to think, OK, cool, but if you like. All right, this just seems real suspect. Yeah. Either do a deeper investigation of it or get rid of them. Yeah.  And there's a problem with most people when you give them ultimate power over someone else. And it's not just the power of having a gun, it's the power of being able to tell someone, do what I'm telling you to do.  There's a crazy video I watched the other day of a white guy pulling over another white guy and he's telling the guy, get out of the car and the guy's, why do you want me to get out of the car? He goes, Because I'm fucking telling you to get out of the car. He pulls out his pepper spray and he goes, Hey, man. He goes, I'm going. I'm speeding. I'm going five miles an hour. Over it goes, stop filming.  He goes, I don't have to stop filming. And he goes, And why are you pointing your fucking pepper spray at me? And he goes, If you don't get out of the car, I'm going to hit you with it. And so there's this back and forth with this guy and he goes to hit it. He goes, it's out. You're lucky. This is your lucky day goes. No, he goes, you're fucking crazy. He's like, you're going to pepper spray me because I'm going five miles an hour over the speed limit.  So this is an example of a person who should never be in a position of having ultimate power over someone like that. Is that if a guy was a really good cop, was a veteran, he would have been able to defuse the situation. He would have walked up to you. And how are you doing, sir? You know why I pulled you over, you're going a little bit faster, going five miles an hour over the speed limit.  Blah, blah, blah, whatever it was, you don't point fucking pepper spray at a guy who just just because he's filming you when he's filming you, he's allowed to do that. And that's you. This is like an audition for you to keep your job.  Yeah, that's what it is like. Do a good job right there. You because you're going to get on the Internet right now. And there's a lot of people that are on the Internet. There was a fucking horrible one that I watched with. This guy was in this verbal altercation with this woman and it wasn't heated. She didn't do anything wrong. And he's he's yelling. She's not listening. So he grabs her rag doll, her to the ground face, plants her and gets her in a rear naked choke.  And he's screaming at her and these other terrible rear naked choke, too. And these other people are standing by watching this and filming it.  And it's fucking madness. This is a terrible way to handle the situation.  Just a person who's either got PTSD or he's all fucked up.  And my buddy Josh is a shitty person, just a shitty person who happens to get this job. Now, guess what? Here's the other problem. Who's going to be a cop now?  Yeah, that's the thing. Who's going to be a cop? We also I wouldn't want to be a cop. I wouldn't want to be a cop. Now, fuck, man, I can only imagine that.  I think the problem is it's like people understand, like the relationship between community and the police should be a symbiotic relationship.  That's that's what it should be. Yes.  Because even the same to the same degree, there needs to be training. I think there needs to be training, not mandated training. But people should be a cognize, especially if I is a gun owner. Yeah. Someone who carries a gun on me 99 percent of the time in my car, on my body, on my person. I should understand the dynamics that a police officer is looking at me from and dealing with people who carry guns and vice versa.  So the officer needs to be an understand and be aware of the fact that, OK, you're living in a population where people carry firearms. So the idea with the presence of a firearm in the hands of civilians should not terrify you that much. It just shouldn't. Now I get it.  There are bad apples all over the place. Thus that brings us full circle. Me as a citizen should understand that because there are certain people who are bad apples, who carry firearms, that I'm interacting with cops. It may be it may want to do ill will towards the cops that I as a citizen should understand how the responsibility says, all right, there are certain things I'm going to do whenever I'm interacting with the cop that signals to them, hey, I don't mean you no harm.  I mean you no threat. I get pulled over. I the first thing I do is I pull over, road one is down. I have my ID and I have my concealed carry license in hand. Right.  Everything I'm doing is just to put the cop at ease. Right. I'm demonstrating the cop. Look, I understand you don't know who I am. I don't know who you are. So we're going to give each other this mutual respect that says, all right, as long as you respect me, I'm going to respect you. And generally speaking. I speak a lot, so you get Kobs recognizing you.  I have it's like 50 50. Oh, that's a lot. Yeah, 50 is a lot.  It is a lot, actually. And the funny thing is, at the best time was I was in a car at the time. I was I was in the car with with my shoes, shoes, McGuff, my then girlfriend and then one of her best friends and we were driving back from Houston. And so I was speeding. And so I think I think I had like a M six at the time. And so I was speeding and I need to slow down and I'm like, shut up.  So go, go, go.  And then I get pulled over and I get pulled over and are laughing.  Ha ha. We told you, you idiot. Ha ha ha ha ha.  And so I'm sitting there and I'm like, I got egg on my face and shit. And cop comes over and he's like he's like, yeah, you know, I do what I normally do. All the windows down here, my my driver's license, he goes, he goes to the runs my information, he's like.  You know, there might be a weird question, but you are you Korean War? I was like, yeah.  And he's like, Oh man, I thought it was. Well, this is why it's a question because your ID is different. Is your real name.  My real name is Collins. Yeah, right. But do you give out your real name.  I give out my real first name. I don't give out my last name because I don't want to have to shoot anybody. I'm being dead serious. I mean, I get I get a lot of weird stuff, so. Oh I'm sure. Yeah. And I don't want I mean, look, if you want to find my real name, you can find you pull up on Wikipedia. But I don't want to make it easy for you. But I mean, if you want to have those problems, I mean, how about it?  But and I've had people threaten me before but overwatched just my stance and things like that.  I I've had people threatening you for your stance on responsible gun ownership until they want to shoot you. I don't understand. It's so it's so ridiculous. I don't understand it. But you have. But I mean, there are a lot of psychos out there. Yeah.  Even anti-gun as can be, because this is the I've had this conversation about you with people that are not gun owners that don't like guns. And I said, listen, there are people out there like yourself that are the best example of what you would hope for a gun owner.  And if you're that's your fucking neighbor, you should be happy that that guy is armed. Some shit goes down. You need someone to help you. You you want people to be able to help themselves. Then in my neighborhood, I think people are going to have a different attitude about this with all this defund on the police talk.  I really do. And the looting and the and not only that, but here in Santa Monica, they have police. Right? The police are there and they were told to stand down. They were told to stand there. Why people are looting.  I think another thing, too, I think there is a semantics issue going on with the fund, the police, at least from what I'm seeing, because initially when I heard about the chief of the police, what the hell you're talking about, like, we can't be this stupid.  I guess there is a segment even within the fund, the police, there are different sects. There are the people who are like, no, we just need to reallocate certain portions of the funding for police in different places. And then there are people who are like, no, we just need to absorb all police, take away the funding and get rid of those people are out of luck.  But here's a funny thing about that. Let's take what's going on in Seattle, right? Yeah. In charge. Yeah.  How fast do we realize within a blink of an eye that crime is going to happen? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter what type of utopia you think you're going to establish. There were going to be messed up people. Well, someone got shot there yesterday. Being an informant here was pretty much a hit, was it?  I think not the one from yesterday, but the one before that, because it was another shooting. Oh, and apparently it seemed like it was a hit, like they were looking for this person and they went to kill him. And I'm like, you supposed that Chazz was supposed to be this utopia, right?  No cops, no money, all of it. And within a blink of an eye, what do you have when the Lord of the Flies, they also don't have hospitals in charge.  Right. Like, what are you going to do if someone does get shot or somebody bled out because. Because the cops probably don't want to go in there. Yeah, well, they wouldn't let him in. Oh, God. When I saw them and I was not going to end. Well, folks, it's not it's not going to end well.  The the way to handle this, in my opinion, is to fix the the current structure, to do it in a logical way.  That makes sense. Yeah. It's not to take everything down. So take this back to what you were saying about Black Lives Matter, don't you think? There's probably people in Black Lives Matter who don't have the sort of Marxist ideas they just don't want black market shop? Absolutely.  Absolutely. The sentiment of Black Lives Matter. I am all for it. I'm on. Yeah, I'm all for it.  The organization. No, that's the problem I have because they're essentially the leadership of this.  So you think that the leadership has, I think, most secret motive that the people that are involved that are doing all the groundwork probably aren't even aware, aware of.  No, they're not.  And I did a whole video about it because I remember I remember Black Lives Matter. And it was a video I did, I think, two years ago. Black, I remember. And when I was at the NRA and Black Lives Matter was attacking the NRA, basically saying that they don't really care about black gun ownership, so forth and so on. It was like an attack piece. And I think it was the branch of Black Lives Matter that's here in L.A., actually.  And so I did a response video and I and I, it was like a fifteen, twenty minute video and I broke it down systematically.  I'm like, all right, well, OK. We started off the Black Lives Matter because of police brutality cuz I'm all for it.  But what has happened now all of a sudden they get this massive wave of funding and, and their whole direction shifting to some other stuff that I have no idea what it has to do with anything like with respect to now it's become this kind of like all encompassing umbrella of LGBTQ and some other stuff. But then and then even aspects of I guess I don't want to say A.F. is under the umbrella, but the whole Marxist kind of communist socialist aspects of a politics kind of creeping into that as well.  And then when you couple that with the idea that you have the actual founders saying that they are trained in Marxism and then you have what you see now playing out where you have these very peaceful protests. Being co-opted by violent people who are now just engaging in rioting and looting and then branding it Black Lives Matter. Hmm, they're wolves, they're wolves hiding amongst sheep, I think there's there's a bunch of things happening at the same time. And I think when it comes to the rioting and looting, I think there's a lot of just opportunists.  No, I don't think necessarily that organized. Some of it is organized some.  But I do believe that in an idea in you're right, because there was a leak, for instance, in Dallas, in Dallas, when a cop shop that I go to all the time, he was telling me he was like, you know, all the windows are broken out.  And really, he was like, they really was just a bunch of kids just running around taking advantage of the chaos and just kind of breaking windows.  You have to take into consideration. These kids haven't worked in three months. Yeah, they're probably broke as fuck and looking for free shit. There's a ton of them and there's just opportunists. And you saw that in New York for sure.  Yeah. I mean, I'm sure you got that here, too. Yeah, for sure.  For sure. But the crazy thing about New York is a lot of it was apartment buildings filming down on the streets because, you know, in New York, everyone's in the house. Yeah. So they're filming. There's so many videos of people filming on the streets while all this madness is going on. This one crazy video where all these people are breaking into shit and this guy runs the street, another guy hits him with a car and he goes flying through the air and the car takes off, bro, it's mad.  And then they just smashing through Soho and breaking into art galleries and stealing everything.  And like, it's it's nuts.  But it also but a question, when you have chaos, you inevitably will get destruction. Yes.  That's I mean, that's that's what happens. Which is why you need structure, which is why you need keep in mind, I'm no fan of big government. I'll be the first one to tell you I'm no fan of big government. However, you do need a level of law and order.  Here's where I'm a fan of big government and I wish it did a better job. When the covid shit went down and no one could work now, it turned out that covid was not nearly as deadly as we were worried it was, but it could have been and no one could work. And that's why everybody stayed locked up when that happened. That's when we needed money. That's what we needed stimulus checks. That's why we needed people to get that twelve hundred bucks that they only handed out once.  Like, how fucking crazy is that?  They handed out trillions of dollars to all these corporations and they handed twelve hundred bucks out once to it. I mean, I don't know how many people got it. I don't know either. But that's not enough for humans to live off three fucking months. There was a time to ever do that. It was then. It was then. That was the time when big government made sense and it didn't work out. It didn't. And there was all these empty promises.  And it's like they got away with giving out one check and then they stopped. And but it was supposed to be a constant thing, right?  It was supposed to be from what I from my understanding, yes. I mean, I didn't get anything clearly. But I from my understanding, it was supposed to be a constant. Yeah. A constant thing. And they didn't happen the way it happened. But it should demonstrate to a lot of people.  To then you're going to take the same government and put your safety completely in the hands of the same government. Right. I just doesn't make sense to me. To me, the government is supposed to be value added to what I'm already capable of doing myself.  Hmm. That's a good way to look at it. And so but I think too many people depend on the government entirely. And I don't think that's smart. Right. I just don't I'm not saying that life is fair. I'm not saying that the system we have in place is fair. It's not it's not it's not fair.  It's just. But what are you going to do? Right. What are you going to do? I the way I was raised in a way that my mom raised me was literally life is not fair, son. Deal with it. Figure it out. Find a way around it. Right. That's that. And that's the way I go about life. A lot of people don't like that. Some people think it's too optimistic. It's not optimistic because I'm realistic.  Unfortunately, whether it's optimistic or pessimistic, it's realistic.  What, you get a hand of cards? Yeah. And if you're dealt a shit hand of cards and you just sit around complaining about it, it doesn't do you any good. There's people that have been dealt shittier hands and they've figured it out. Yeah, it sucks. It sucks to be dealt a shitty hand of cards. And I understand envy. I understand when you're looking at people that have dealt an amazing hand of cards.  Yeah, no, the funny thing about it is I you know, I think I tweet out some time ago. I listen to a lot of I listen to a lot of rap, like a lot of a lot of rap music.  And I'm not I'm not from the streets. Yeah, sure.  There was a period of my life where I were where I live was basically the slums. But I'm not a street dude. Never sold drugs.  None of that. However, there's a there's a certain. Aspect of that music and understanding that there are a lot of people who have come from worse places than me, who have been who have managed to kind of bring themselves out of it, that when I look at my life, I say, well, I have no excuse, I have no excuse whatsoever. So I need to figure out a way to make my situation better. However, now there's no guarantee I'll be able to do it.  I may I may work my ass off and still fail.  But I'm going to keep working my ass. That's part of the game of life. The unfortunate thing is that some people are not gifted with a parent that gives them the sort of perspective that your mom gave you. The life is not fair, fair deal with it. And then you go forth with that knowledge. Just a lot of people out there that unfortunately, they're born into terrible households where they were abused and there's crime around them and violence and they never get a chance.  They never get a chance.  And I get it because they've developed an abusive mentality, these mentalities that develop in this in that situation. And that's the thing, too, that I think that's a problem with the conversation that's going on. Too many people are too dismissive of that reality. Right. Right. Because even though I can sit here and tell, I can tell you basically what I'm saying to pull yourself up by your bootstraps. That's essentially what I'm saying. Or at least that's the way I look at life.  I'm like, figure out a way that I'll have to figure out a way to get the boot so I can pull my ass up.  But to completely ignore the circumstance like you talked about, you have to talk about a kid who's a who's a child of somebody who grew up in the 80s. Crack epidemic. Yeah, right. To parents who were crackheads.  You can't look at this person and like, you know, like little baby. Little baby just came out with a song I called Bigger Picture. And then and he was like, I'm just a product of my environment. Nobody nobody taught us any better. So as a result of that, I look at that and I understand what the 80s crack epidemic did to black families during that time period. So now you have crackheads.  Raising crackheads and then having kids, that's essentially what would happen as a result of that. So to ignore that and to just say nah, nah, nah, nah, you know, everybody has it hard, which they do, but you can't discount it and say that it doesn't have an effect because there is. There is.  And there is an aspect of being so low, you really don't stand a chance in hell. Right. Right. And to dismiss that wholesale I think is disingenuous. Now, what do we do about it? I don't I'm not I'm not smart enough to have the answer for that.  But but there needs to be something.  A bare minimum, let's have the conversation. Yeah, I think the conversation should be how come you guys had trillions of dollars to bail out these corporations during the covid lockdown, but you didn't have trillions of dollars to fix these impoverished communities that have been in the same situation for decades. Thank you for contacting me nuts.  But that's what it is. It's like there's so much money that you can spend to avoid an economic collapse, but yet there's no money to fix what's been an economic collapse forever.  What are you doing with my. I pay 30 percent tax. What the fuck are you doing with my money? That. Exactly. Exactly.  You know, and I've said it again. I've said it before. I'll say it again. If you want to make America great, you would want less losers. How do you have less losers? Give people more of an opportunity to get better. Yeah, give people more of an opportunity to succeed. And that's they should look at all those spots, whether it's Baltimore or Detroit or south side of Chicago. Look at all those spots in this country as places where people have much less of a chance.  So if you give them more of a chance, you can have more productive people. You can have a stronger country. It's really simple, simple.  And the funny thing is it's you'll probably see the most growth happen in those places. It's just like lifting weights. Oh, you know, I haven't lived in 20 years. You know, you start with on a regular basis, like, yo, I'm w we've been doing it for a while. You're like, oh man, I'm stagnating. Yeah. Good point.  Yeah, that's a good point.  You know, and it would it's also we're supposed to be a community. Yeah.  You know, I mean that's one thing that I do love about these peaceful protests, all these people marching together, whether or not they're all going to get covid or not, just that probably a lot of them don't get me started.  In fact, you know, it's like especially at night, apparently, Brett Weinstein sent me something. Jamie, I'll send it to you. It's very interesting. But one of the things that they found out about cold it is that it dies almost instantly, airborne covid when it hits UV light. Really? Yeah. I'm going to send you this, Jamie. Which is really kind of crazy. Yeah, so it's one of the reasons why, apparently.  It wasn't like. Really, I'm sorry. Hello. You know, do this and they don't do this. Yeah, this work. Here we go, it's rapidly inactivated by simulated sunlight or sunlight. Yeah, just UV light kills it.  Yeah, you can see we run around my house is going to look like a rape.  I know, but but what's interesting is what Brett Weinstein's what his theory was or his thought was. It's this he's a biologist and he was on the podcast last week. And one of the things that he pointed out was there's all these indications that this is something that escaped from a lab. Yeah.  Like very specific indications. Yeah. And these indications are basically the weight of all that involved far too quickly. And then he pointed out some things that I'm not can remember because I'm a moron. But he said also, it seems like because of the fact that it dies in sunlight, but it spreads very easily with without sunlight, it's very contagious. He thinks it may have evolved in this laboratory environment to be more contagious while indoors.  So his his thought is that this is something that they probably had created in order to test various antiviral medications and all these different things. And that during this process, somehow or another, it got out. And it's one of the reasons why this thing spread so quickly to people indoors. Gotcha.  Yeah, but it's so fucking it's so crazy. It's so contentious. That's another thing. People got mad at me because I was saying that you didn't have to wear a mask. Well, that's what I read.  The CDC was saying that unless you're dealing with covid patients or was it the World Health Organization? But then again, also I was saying it to fuck with my friend Bellbird. You should know this, folks, when I was saying that I was trolling Bellbird to try to get them to go on a rant, but it maybe was the Kyle Dunigan show to listen to and listen to me. I'm a moron. Go online, but don't get mad at me either.  I don't know what the fuck I'm talking about, but I do know that there's these giant spikes in all these cities where they had big protests. Yeah, I mean I mean, that's going to happen. I mean, yeah. I mean, you've got to have a highly dense populated area with a bunch of people marching, sweating and.  But what's hilarious is they're blaming it on Republican governors opening up the states too early.  So they keep blaming it on this party politics stuff. So it drives me insane. But it's happened in California, too. I can't do that. This is super liberal, progressive state. It is happening right here, too. We're going to do ourselves crazy with this. We are political and they should make they should make political parties illegal.  They're really I'm not you can't you can't say you're a Republican or a governor or or a Democrat. It's just too confusing to people.  I just want you to tell me what you want to do. Yeah. Yeah. Tell me what you want. What do you want to do. Yeah. What do you want to do? And then we can talk and then let us have that conversation.  Stop hiding behind a donkey or an elephant. Confuse the fuck out of me.  You know, I'm, I'm, I'm of the same nature. Yeah. Like what do you what are we doing, man. We keep playing this game.  What it does is it creates extremes. Yep. Right. And so without extremes, again, no nuance. Yeah. Without nuance. Really don't solve anything. Everything just becomes everything becomes a nail and everyone's in hammer. Yeah. That's pretty much what happens. Exactly. And so we need, we need more scalpels. That's what we need. We need more options.  You know, this two party option that's left us with Joe Biden or Donald Trump is so bonkers.  That's another thing. People got mad at me last week because they said that Joe Biden is experiencing cognitive decline and people are.  How is it how is anybody not seeing that? Thank you.  I don't think they're really I think I think it's just people that think that I'm going to fuck up the Democrats options, that somehow another people going to listen to me and come on, look, it's it's so it's not even like, look, it's not debatable.  It's not it's not it's not that.  And imagine if Trump was that confused all the time.  They would be hammering at hammering him hard. And by the way, he has been confused before. Don't get it wrong.  I mean, but the both old they're both as fuck. And also, I think Trump's medicated.  I think when I've seen these videos where he's like slurring David Pakman had a bunch that he put up where he's like slurring his words. I think he's like coming down off some shit or, you know what I mean?  Like, I think he's on some uppers. I think he's on some I think that's how he's so peppy.  Well, if that doesn't rally, if that's the case, get the same shit to Joe Biden.  I don't say because I'd like to think because it's ridiculous, man. It's beyond politics. Yes, beyond politics. Just his cognitive ability. I can't vote for him alone on that right now. Granted his politics completely. He's not didn't stand a chance in hell with me. But cognitively. No, it's not it's not about who are you going to vote for? Do you know?  Right now I'll probably do something I did last time. But yeah, yeah, that's what I meant. What does that mean? I Abortifacient Plaza area and. All right, people get mad at you all the time.  Really?  Yeah, but I'm a pragmatic about did they get mad at you for that more or the Black Lives Matter position you were just describing.  Well the Black Lives Matter. We'll find out the Black Lives Matter position I described.  I hadn't talked about that in almost two years, but you talked about it on video, so. Yeah, I got I got some people understood where I was coming from. Something people have to understand.  Like, I really, really, really try to remove all sense of emotion when I try to assess or analyze the situation. I look at I look at things as pragmatic as I possibly can, not discounting my emotions. I just try to remove it when I'm analyzing it and then make my decision. I'm still human. Right? Right. So I'm going to have my biases. But I am very practical. And I also understand I have a platform that is rather large.  So it's irresponsible for me to just go off on emotional tirades based on how I feel without investigating facts. Now, have I been wrong or have I maybe shot my mouth off a little bit beforehand before I should have? Yeah, but I try to learn from those mistakes. Right. And so with and then another thing, too, because there is no nuance.  Most of the people who are mad at me about, especially with the Black Lives Matter aspect of things like I don't have a problem with the Black Lives Matter sentiment, I'm freaking black, but I do understand that.  Yeah. However, I just I'm not a fan of the organization. You're not a fan of Marxism. I'm not. Yeah, yeah. Actually, you know what, that's that's a beautiful way of putting it.  Yeah. Remove that Marxist element of it when we talk.  That's what's interesting is like every movement gets kind of co-opted by some of the ideas that are attached to the movement. It's like sometimes they have a really good bill. Right. And they're trying to pass like a stimulus bill. And then you look in the bill and there's all sorts of shit.  I mean, it's almost trying to shove anything deliberate, something, you know, they'll pollute it so so it doesn't get passed.  That's that's a big part of politics. Yeah, but you don't expect that from something that seems so organic, like Black Lives Matter, like Michael Che has a great bit about it, but he's like, think about I'm going to fuck up the bit. But it's like basically just that sentiment is so like all we're saying is they matter.  Yeah. Even people argue that.  Yeah, that's that's where I look at the disingenuous nature of the conversations that are being had. Like, it's as simple as this. Like I don't see why anybody would get mad at Black Lives Matter and I understand why anybody would get mad at all lives matter. But I can see why somebody would get mad at someone saying all lives matter and response to Black Lives Matter, because what it seems like it's doing is just undermining and just kind of tossing aside the aspect of the complaint.  Right.  The complaint is cops have been killing black people and it's on video. And we all should be outraged. We should. Yes, yes.  And if and if it is killing people, because people do make the argument that, well, they're all lives matter and more white people are killed by cops. And you're right. And I think you should be as equally mad. I do. If you if you have police brutality, should should not stop it. Race, riot police brutality, police brutality.  So my but my thing is this. If we live in a country and we're supposed to be all one, all lives do matter. We do. However, if there is a particularized group of people within that within that that inclusiveness that feel like their lives don't matter, at bare minimum, we should have that conversation.  Right. We should just at least had that conversation say, all right, why do you feel that way? Why what is it exactly that makes you think that your life doesn't matter? And then when we go through the particular points and address each one, you know what? It may be coming from nowhere. It may be delusion or it may be completely, utterly valid, but a bare minimum. If we can't even get to the point, we have the conversation because our instinctive gut is to say, no, all lives matter.  What do you talk about? Right. It's not it's not fair. It's not fair. I'm not saying one one side is right or the other.  What I'm saying is we're going to be a country that's all one people. And there's a part of it that's telling you we don't feel like we matter. Right. We need to address it. Yes. And understand why the fuck they feel that way. If the Indian people were saying the same thing. Indian lives don't matter. I don't really I'm not Indian. I didn't grow up in the culture. I don't know what particularize issues you may have growing up in a society.  I don't what the hell you're talking about, but talk to me.  Let me hear you out. Right. Because clearly you feel some type of way. So let me hear what you have to say about that and then we can have that conversation say, all right, maybe we'll reach a point where they go, you know what? Maybe I was taking this a little too far. Or maybe I go, damn, I didn't realize that I've been so consumed with my life that I didn't realize that you had to go through these difficulties as well, that I didn't have to write, you know, but we can't even get to that point because we're so polarized, so polarized.  I feel like I think we're doing better at it than we ever have before, though, just because of the fact there's been these gigantic peaceful protests and the conversation is gone. And also because, look, I don't think it's good that people get fired for saying all lives matter. But they do get fired for saying all lives matter. He can't. It's kind of crazy. I can't stand I think people should be allowed to say whatever they want without fear of retribution.  I do, too.  But it's it's fascinating to me that there's these feel fearful people that want to cancel people for every every mistake and everything they've done wrong. One thing that I had a conversation with somebody about it when they were saying, like, what's wrong with saying all lives matter? I'm like, there's nothing wrong with saying all lives matter. But here's the problem. The only reason why people are saying Black Lives Matter is because there's people out there that don't feel like they matter.  If you said white lives matter, people would be like, yeah, you couldn't have a movement in this country that says white lives matter. People be like, what the fuck are you complaining about?  But really. But here's the thing about that, too, though. Everybody has in a country is as mixed as we are, everyone has the particularize issues in this country. Everybody has their own problems as a group. I'm not going to discount your problems because I don't suffer from them. So if you want to tell me all white white lives matter, cuz I'm not white, I don't know what the hell you're going through. I mean, who are you out.  What was the issue. Because I'm still I'm living in this country with you. I consider you my brother. So we may have a different upbringing, a different cultural background. But tell me what what is the issue that you're dealing with and why do you feel that way? Because right now, from my standpoint, I mean, I as a black person, I mean, look at you and say, well, what the hell are you complaining?  It's so ridiculous.  All lives matter at least makes some sense that we should all be together. Like if you talk to police about police brutality in particular. Yeah, bad cops kill all kinds of people. There's plenty of videos of cops killing white people. This is a horrible video of those cops pushing that old man down.  He can't even walk past so messed up. That old man has a broken skull and he can't fucking walk and he's got permanent brain damage and he's old as fuck.  And then Trump goes and says some crazy shit, like he might have been antifa and he might have been like, he's old as fuck, but that's so crazy. That is the crazy like to look at that video and not say, hey, you shouldn't push an old man like that. Yeah.  So I don't know what the guy was saying to the cops, but there's no I mean, I mean these old guys like him, he said he felt he felt too easy like bitch, you can't even walk down a ramp.  I think what happened. Right, he spent ten minutes in his fucking speech of the day talking about why he could why it was so hard to walk down the ramp. My shoes were slippery. I get it, man. But you can't even walk down the slippery shoes on. You tell me you wouldn't fall down like that, old man. I bet you would bet you fucking what.  But I think sometimes what I think it's weird because I think the problem is sometimes and I suffer from it, too. I mean, we get so much information so fast. Right. And it's hard to keep up with it. I mean, people ask me, why don't you talk about this and talk about that? It's like it's not a gun issue. Why don't you. I can barely keep up with the gun issue. Right. Much less anything else.  I think he suffers from that sometimes, too. Well, he'll see something. He suffers from the same kind of headline focus. You'll see it and won't really investigate any further. And then he'll just and then he'll kind of take whatever confirmation bias he may have over here. And we just kind of throw it together and then he'll say something.  I think you're 100 percent right. I think he has too many things going on. Yeah, I think, first of all, I don't think anybody should be president. I think it's a ridiculous position and I think it should be a council of wise folks. That's what it should be. That becomes an oligarchy, maybe.  Yeah, good point. Well, what the fuck man has been a presence that doesn't fit in either the mean.  But even then within that, I mean, some people would argue president is nothing more than a ceremonial position.  Right. But we pin all these problems on them. It's like we pin covid on them. We pin North Korean and we pin China trade relations. We pin war with Iran, war with Syria, war with this, that there's so many different things, the environment, all. What are you do in these fucking fracking?  I respect anybody who's the president. I may not agree with you, but to be in a position to do what you have to do with I have no choice but to respect it, which is why I will always respect the office and who's in it.  Well, I hope they do. Well, that's what I do. Yeah. I want them to do well. The idea that there's some people that wanted Trump to fail and they wanted the economy to collapse to them so he would get removed from office, now they just want to prove themselves.  There's a little bit of that, too. But it's also like, come on, man, that is bad for everybody.  What you what you really should be is like what everybody should be hopeful or should have been hopeful for when he got elected is to be pleasantly surprised, pleasantly surprised that he said, look, I'm sorry, all the shit I said about Mexicans being rapists, but now I'm not going to do that anymore. I will do my best to make this.  But he isn't the best player even that even that was taken out of context. Yes, it's so it's like it's it sucks because he has nothing, because people always like to say that, man, people are dumb. And and I'm like, I don't want to think that more and more I start to think that. But what I think a lot of it is, is, man, we have so much information now and so many people are angling for their own agenda based on the on the same information.  You don't know what's what. And so we were getting these bits of it, if I'm worried about raising my kids, working, providing for my family, it's hard. It's going to be hard for me to intellectualize. I mean, we do this for a living, right? So it's going to be hard for somebody who's just trying to raise a family.  Well, it's not like you don't have a family to raise either, but it's hard to be able to pass through all the information we have at our disposal to come up with what's actually true and correct or full context.  Right. And have a good take on. Yeah. You know, I mean, that's the other thing.  It's so difficult for someone like me who does talk for a living and I fuck things up all the time, you know, and I can't imagine being in charge of as many things as anybody that is a president or a governor or even a mayor is in charge. It must be fucking insane. Yeah. No, it's not.  I know what I have to deal with. Yeah. In terms of just my little platform over here in this little small area. And it's a lot, man, because especially if you actually give a damn. Yes. If I'm if I was just out here acting and just saying shit because, you know, just feeding my base, whatever they want to hear. Right, then that'd be a different story. But I challenge I challenge my base all the time.  But I think that's one of the reasons why you resonate, because you are a genuine person like you're it's very obvious that the things you say, you say them because you mean it. And this is your perspective and this is your well thought out perspective on things. And I think that that's that there's a big difference between that and someone who just says shit because they think that this is their their brand. Yeah. And this is their audience is going to respond to this.  And this is probably going to get me more likes. Yeah. And that's a real problem with social media.  And the thing is, it's it's frustrating. Like I did I a little piece on a mod Aubrey Aubrey case, the shooting in Georgia. I didn't see it though. I know the case.  So I basically I did I did a complete legal analysis of it, which essentially what I did in that 20 minute video, lawyers get paid 500 to 1000 dollars an hour for. Because so much time it took me two days to put that video together because I needed to make sure all my facts and elements were correct. I had to go back to being lost all over again and. While that's happening, there are tons of other things happening, too, that I need to comment on as well, but I'm just I rather air on the side of falling behind on being first on the news to make sure or try to get it as right as possible.  And that requires a lot of fucking time, man.  And then on top of that, I still got to review guns and do all the other stuff. So it frustrates me. But like my mom said, you made your bed and lane it, right. I'm not complaining about it, but I just need some people to understand the perspective and where I'm coming from and why. I'm not quick to talk about a lot of stuff, because sometimes I just need time to figure out what the hell is going on, because there are a lot of people I get messages who rely on my information to make their decision.  They don't just follow what I say. They just use my information to make their decision. So I want to give them the best piece of information, like putting gas in your car. Don't push shitty gas in the car. I want to run functionally, so I would try to give it the best gas as possible. And so that's what I try to do, especially when I talk about the gun issue, because right now there's so much misinformation on the gun issue and a lot of times people don't even know what they don't know.  Like, for instance, like when you had Alonzo Bodden on here, like I could tell a lot about, he seems come from a good place. He just does some things he just didn't know he knew or didn't know. Right. And so that's how that's kind of where I put myself. I said, OK, how do I tailor and craft videos in such a way that somebody who isn't necessarily a gun person can understand it?  What what Alonzo Bodden said, what what bothered you? Part of it. So some of the misinformation with respect to the background checks, the background check aspect of it, where he kind of talked about it from the standpoint of the waiting period, the the questionnaire that you filled out in the beginning before you submit yourself to the background check, that that that was the background check and it wasn't. And so because a lot of people think that a lot of people think that, oh, you just go there, fill out a yes or no question, yes or no questionnaire about whether or not you can own a gun and then you get a gun.  And that's not the case. And so I corrected that. And then also what I did, I just critiqued his position on a couple of things, like, for instance, high capacity magazines, because he says he's like, you don't need 50 rounds in a clip, so to speak. Well, there's actually a magazine, but that's neither here nor there. But I, I disagree with that. Now, in that regard, he's not wrong.  That's his opinion. My opinion is I think I do need a magazine that has fifty rounds. And then I went on to explain why. Would you say you want to kill 50 people no matter what you say?  So, so, so with respect. So why do we own firearms? We own firearms. A lot of people are only fired for self-defense. And as a regular person, I'm not a criminal. I just go about my day. I don't want to be. I'm already I'm I'm I'm already coming on the back end. I'm already at a disadvantage because a criminal who's going out to commit a crime knows he's going to commit a crime. And what can you do when you know you're about to do something?  You prepare. And since he's a criminal, he doesn't have to deal with all of the restraints that come with what loss, right. So if there's a law that says you can't have more than 10 rounds like here in California. Right. I can't have a magazine that has more than 10 rounds.  If I'm a criminal and I know I'm going to commit a crime, do I really give a damn about a law that says I can't I can't carry 10 rounds of my magazine? Right. I don't. However, as a as a citizen, when I'm going about my life, carrying a gun on me is hard enough. Right. Because like, you know, there's hope this whole dialogues about what size gun you can have, how many rounds you want to have, what bullet caliber things of that nature.  I don't know what I'm going to face.  I could face one guy. I can face one guy who's high as hell. I can face two, three, four or five guys. I don't know.  So why artificially limit the number of bullets I can have in my gun when I don't know what I might be facing to protect my life from what's a weird thing to it's because like, I don't know if you're preserving any life by limiting the size of a magazine, you're not.  I don't understand it.  I think it's hard to be in control. No, go ahead. What the argument is, is it they're looking at it from a Massouda perspective, right?  They're saying if you limit the amount of bullets at the mass, you can have the change clips.  Yeah, but again, he's going out to commit mass murder. Do you think he cares about breaking the law? They say he can only have ten rounds in his magazine.  I think their idea is that it makes it harder for him to get those clips because he can't get them at the local gun store. There are more of those out there than guns.  And we have over 300 being guns in this country. Right. They're going to have them.  But, you know, with a lot of these mass shooters, here's the other problem. They're actually getting the guns illegally. They're getting them from someone and they're stealing them from someone's gun safe or from someone's house. Yeah, that's what a lot of it is coming from anyway.  I think what a lot I think a lot of the kind of project, not so much the politicians. I think the politicians are by and large, very disingenuous, but a lot of people who support these ideas, who are just regular people, I think it's their way of trying to figure out some way of control because because mass shootings terrifies, because they're so random, like they're like tornadoes to hurricanes. You can kind of prepare for hurricane. You kind of have an idea of where the path is coming, where it's going, tornadoes.  They just touch down and destroy it. Right. And you don't know where it's coming. Same thing with mass shootings. Mass shootings are terrifying because they just kind of happened out of nowhere. It's like, whoa, what OK, what can we do?  Because you feel helpless. You really feel helpless. And even though they account for almost a statistical zero of gun of gun violence in this country, they still terrifies because we don't know when or where it's going to happen. See, the other gun violence stuff doesn't really terrify as much because we know where it happens. It happens in our cities. Don't go to. Right.  Yeah, but mass shootings terrified from that stance because we don't know when it's going to come. So we think, OK, well, we we limit this and we restrict this and then it'll minimize it even more as I know it's not going to happen.  We have to deal with the reality and the reality terrifies me just as much as anyone else. But what are you going to do? Right. You can lay down and die. No, you fight. Yeah. And that and that's it. And then I'll remember when I was on Bill Maher and we talked about arming teachers. Right. The idea of arming teachers. And he was like I was like, well, if a teacher is willing to sacrifice what teachers have sacrificed their lives for their students doing Mashi during school shootings.  So I'm like, if teachers are willing to sacrifice their life for for their kids, why not put a gun in your hand to give them the power to fight for their life?  When he goes because they're teachers, he's like they're there to teach.  And I'm like, well, they're already dying for the students.  Well, the idea that it's mutually exclusive seems kind of silly.  Yeah. You know, there's a lot of really intelligent people that can teach and also know how to shoot a gun. Exactly. That's not.  And I think the misconception, too, was I was like a lot of people thought I was saying we need to mandate that teachers own firearms. That's not what I was saying. What I was saying was, if there's a teacher who wants to go through the process of being able to carry a firearm in school, why not let them do that? Right. That's all I'm saying.  When he said because they're teachers, that everybody. Oh, my God.  Yes, it was thunderous. Yes, yes, yes. You got him.  That's the problem with doing a show in front of an audience. Yeah. Yeah.  No, you do shit for class because their teacher said that you now, in all fairness, during the conversation, he poked and prodded and I think he gave me more of a fair shot than anybody else. Yeah, he's an intelligent guy. Yeah, he is.  Now, when I went to when I went to the roundtable discussion, I was a different story. And part of it was I thought I could approach it rationally. Yeah.  And I couldn't because all the person that I was dealing with was doing was appealing to emotion.  And so what were they saying? Basically, there was like I would talk about the idea of background checks, for instance, and I was like, well, how are you going to enforce them?  And they're like, she would just kind of stutter and stammer.  But then if the bill more posted a picture of a guy who had like a bunch in California who had a bunch of guns that were seized and she's like, oh, my God, all those guns, who needs all those guns?  I'm like, I'm like, look, I get it. Like, you see. And you attribute a very nefarious nature to firearms in general. I don't I have a lot of guns. I don't go around killing people. And I only have two hands. A guy only has two hands. The number of guns he has is irrelevant. Then she's like, but they can use those guns for other people to kill as many people like it just just hysteria.  And I'm just like, oh God, that's not how this works.  Well, it's also a long conversation.  And this is my problem with any of those shows that you got like three minutes to discuss something that should be three hours.  And at the end of three hours, you're probably so yeah. You still got to walk away with a lot of questions and maybe not even really coming up with any solution.  And most likely now, most likely not coming up with any solution.  It seems like it's a very particularly human problem. You know, the problem of gun ownership in this country, you're damned if you do and you're damned if you don't.  Yeah, you know, it's.  And I think, again, one of the reasons why I want to bring you on right after this covid thing when I contacted you, because I think that people are now understanding that, hey, this police thing that you were counting on to protect you.  Well, there's a lot of people that are trying to defend them now. You're not going to get them in certain places because they're in conflict with the state and the government, like in Atlanta or in New York, where they're quitting left and right. And in California, they're trying to get the sheriff of Santa Monica stamped to step down. I mean, you got a lot of problems of the police. It's not as simple as call the police. They'll be there for you.  Even when it was that simple. Yeah, even when it was in effect.  It's an illusion. Right. And this is what you and I and I know we talked about this before, that this this idea that you shouldn't be self-reliant, you should be dependent upon the government. This is what the Second Amendment was written for. People say it was designed like a well armed militia was designed in case, you know, someone was coming in attacking you like, no, it could be the government themselves.  The government is filled with people say, yes, they're humans. And when is when have you ever seen a time where the government has said, no, we want less power, never.  And once they get power, they never give us come back. And I keep trying to tell people like, look, I get you want to try things. They just want to throw things on a wall and hope it sticks. Yeah. Let's let's ban these guns. Let's limit this capacity. Do this like you do that you don't get it back. So even if it's a with it doesn't work.  We think the government is going to say, well, maybe get this, this whole idea that they're going to have a gun buyback program. Right. To voluntary buyback. You think they're going to give you your guns back if it doesn't work, if the crime rate still stays the same, which it has in other places that have done the same thing.  But Australia by boat, Australia and what they don't talk about, about Australia is when they did it, it actually crime spiked. Did it? Yeah, because you got to think about it like the whole notion or idea that, like, criminals are criminals of opportunity. Right. Right. So no one has a gun.  No one has a gun to think about. It's just like what's going on in in charge now? What was going on in Atlanta? I there know no cops around. Criminals are going to show up and they want to take advantage of the chaos. Yes, period. And you're not going to tell me that? No.  The cops will always be there. Look what happened in Canada.  The guy stole a gun from a cop, killed the cop and went on a rampage killing spree for almost 12, 13 hours. He shut down an entire city by himself.  That one is a weird one.  And I was reading something about it last night, see if you could find this, that he withdrew a huge amount of money, like more than 400 shit.  So, yeah, he withdrew more than four hundred thousand dollars from a bank account. How does the how was he even able to do that? Exactly.  And there's some concern that this might have been some sort of intelligence operation, that there's something more to this story because they were talking about the way he got that money, that it very well could have been that he was involved in something totally different. Level of Nova Scotia shooter case has hallmarks of an undercover operation. Police say the killers withdraw four hundred seventy five thousand dollars was highly irregular. And how the RCMP agent would get money, how an RCMP.  I don't know what that Royal Canadian Mounted Police, I think that is the withdrawal. And seventy five thousand dollars in cash by the man who killed 22 Nova Scotia in April matches the method that is Royal Canadian Mountain Mounted Police right. Uses to send money to confidential informants and agents. Sources say Gabriel Wartman, who is responsible for the largest mass killing in Canadian history, withdrew the money from a Brinks deposit in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia, March 30th, stashing a Carryl filled with hundred dollar bills in the trunk of his car.  Wow. Well, my thing is, is like this for an operation that complex. Do you think they'd be that sloppy? Yeah, yeah.  They're filled with people, government and they're Canadians. So they're actually nice sources in both banking.  And the RCMP say the transaction is consistent with how the RCMP funnels money to its confidential informants and agents and is not an option available to private banking customers.  The RCMP has repeatedly said that it has no, in quotes, special relationship with Wartman, which means the regular relationship with court documents show that Wartman owned a New Brunswick registered company called Birka Broman, the legal owner of two of his vehicles, including one of the police replica cars. Oh, he was a crazy person. He had a police replica car. He had a lot of them. Whatever the purpose of the company, there's no public evidence that could have been able to move large quantities of cash.  Wartman also ran his own what is it, dangerous business. You make fake teeth. So it is dangerous place, basic goodness. Oh, wow.  OK, so we had to fake teeth. Business and there's no reason to believe that it would also work, that it would it also would require him to handle large amounts of cash if Wartman is or was an RCMP informant or agent. It would explain why the force appeared not to take action on complaints about his illegal guns and his assault on his common law wife.  Whoa. So he might have been a fucking informant, so he might have been working for the government. Hmm hmm.  That makes sense because there's a lot of money. So it doesn't make. Listen, there's a lot of sick fucks and all lines of business, including dentists. How many dentists have been accused of feeling up ladies after they put them under?  Right. I have. Yeah, yeah, yeah. There's some sick fucks that are in all lines of work, including informants, police informants, like you're a fucking rat. So he's a he's a rat. That went bad.  Yeah, could be. So there's complex there's a complex backstory, but very much so.  Yeah. Yeah. Oh nonetheless it'll happen.  Yeah. I don't know. But then again it's funny because immediately after that, yes. Unilaterally Trudeau basically said no more guns, no more, no assault rifles which are which drive gun people crazy.  Yes. Because what does that mean.  All right. So assault rifle, an assault rifle is to put it simply and I'm try to explain some plain language for people who don't know any different. Most people think when they hear assault rifle, they think a machine gun, which is fully automatic or semiautomatic axiomatic, fully automatic or burst. Basically, it's like three rounds at a time. Each time you pull the trigger, that's an assault rifle. They AR 15s are not assault rifles, right, single shot, yeah, the single shot gun you pull trigger once you get one bullet, it's kind of synonymous.  It's like comparing a Rolls-Royce to a Chrysler 300. Yeah. Why do they call it an assault rifle?  Because it looks badass. Well, what to call an assault rifle. Why do people call an AR an assault rifle? Well, because that's the language used by the anti-gun acts who are pushing an agenda. So what they want to do is they want to closely tie the idea of a machine gun that people largely see being used in movies to what's being sold on the street.  So the distinction would be automatic versus semiautomatic. Yes.  And the difference between an AR is you don't have to cock it like a bolt action rifle every time you fire a shot.  Yes, yeah. Yeah. And that's like one of the arguments in the hunting world is that you don't need an AR and it's not it wouldn't be effective. And I've actually heard people say that I'm like, no, no. As a hunter, it would be more effective because oftentimes you need a second shot to get that shot, but you get out the second shot instantly, bang, bang. But ironically, that's the same argument they'll used to.  Why do we need to ban them? Because it allows a shooter to shoot. It allows you to shoot faster than normal. And and I argue that's why we need them for self-defense. Yeah.  Again, it becomes one of those like really messy people. Problems like it's a mess. That's the common denominator behind all of it. Yeah, it's the people people.  But now they don't even know what they'll do is they'll try to invalidate that argument if they could put them into people problem and they'll try to and they'll try to undermine it by acting like it's just a stupid trope. Yeah, but it's the truth.  Well, I made a tweet a long time ago that said this country has a mental health problem disguised as a gun problem.  I agree with you. That's really what it is. I absolutely agree with you. That's really what it is.  It's and this is one thing that never gets discussed. Whenever one of these people does something really fucked up, they don't look at the amount of medication these people are on.  It's funny. They don't they don't really they're all on medication. Almost all there's a common denominator, guns and medication. And one gets looked at very closely and the other gets blatantly ignored. What do you think that is?  Because the pharmaceutical industry has a shitload of money and there's a lot of these politicians that are in the pocket of the pharmaceutical industry. They they have a firm grip on the narrative.  And so the gun is a perfect scapegoat.  And they also don't want all the other people that are on these psychotropic medications to feel bad, that they're on them, that they could be lumped in with these same people that like imagine if we just started, like if it's SSRI or antidepressants or antianxiety medication.  Imagine if that becomes the narrative in the news. Yeah, like that. People on SSRI are fucking dangerous because all these school shooters are unnecessary. Now, see, that's true.  But hold on a second, because that would almost be a better argument than the NRA, because if you look at the NRA and you look at NRA members and the amount of NRA members that have actually done these horrible mass shootings, it's like none.  Yeah, it's crazy that the medication is a better correlation than the NRA saying that people are going to explode.  What can you share your government? Shall they have information on you? No, I'm just I'm just saying the fact is responsible gun owners are not the people that are doing these things. It's crazy people. And unfortunately, crazy people are oftentimes on medication. Now, that's like a correlation causation argument as well. I'm not saying that the medication is forcing these people into doing that, but I am saying that I have known people that have taken SSRI eyes and have taken antidepressants and a lot of different psycho psycho psychotropic medicines.  And one of the things that they've said is that it makes them not care about things. It's real weird stuff can happen. It's like it's a it disassociate them from emotions and things don't bother them. And like that.  That's scary.  That's scary to me because I'm I am the total opposite me. I feel everything. I mean, I really do. I'm a very sensitive person. I know how to handle it, but I'm very sensitive.  And it could speak to the notion that when you hear people describe the account of interacting with a mass shooter. Yes. Them having this kind of stoic verbalization.  Yeah, they've got Shaka's. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. Well, they're all on medication, man. I mean, it's it's really like the numbers are staggering. And I'm not saying medication causes people to do that. Yeah, I'm not.  I mean, it's something it's something that that needs to be talked about it and explored it. I sit on the board of of of Walk to Talk America, which is a mental health fight, a to a mental health organization, and whose goal basically is to address the correlation, if any, between firearm ownership and mental health.  And it's just something that you got involved because of the attacks on gun ownership and the recognition that there is some sort of correlation.  So the catalyst for it was to say, because a lot of gun owners will say, well, it's a mental health issue. And we always say that they do, and I agree, we do believe that is the case. So what walks to Talk America does is it says, OK, so let's walk to talk. Let's try to figure out how to fix or deal with the mental health issue component. Right. If we're going to say that's what it is and it's not the gun and we do believe that.  So let's start having that conversation and doing what it needs to do. So what the appropriate organization does is it it crosses the aisle with people in the mental health space and brings them over into the gun side and vice versa. And so we can have those conversations to figure out a way how we can kind of balance the arm, the firearm ownership with mental health, because that conversation is not being had. Right. And so I think if we're going to talk about it and say it is a mental health issue.  OK, so let's let's start this deep dive into the mental health issue and see if we can come up with a solution that that speaks to why we have so many people that have these mental health issues and how do we exist in a world with this? Many people have mental health issues in a world also where we have this many guns. Yeah. And so so that we can better solve whatever problems we think we have instead of just starting around. Well, we need to ban this.  We need to be lot like instead of doing that. I couldn't agree more.  I don't think it's that simple. I don't think it's as simple as banning things, because I think there's a lot of people that are responsible gun gun users and gun owners. And I don't think you should do anything to take away their rights. Yeah, I really don't. And I get in arguments with people about that, particularly my my liberal friends. Yeah. You know, they're like, how can you call yourself a liberal when you have those that perspective?  I'm like, because it's rational.  I don't understand why the gun debate is even politicized. It should not be it shouldn't be political. The fact that there's division between like the fact that you can't be a liberal and pro-gun is the case in the same way that like I can't be like the idea of being conservative and pro-gun is seen as a crazy thing. That doesn't make any sense to me either. I think the gun should live in a space that it's outside of the idea of politics, within reason, of course, because, you know, there's always going to be everything.  Politics is kind of everything. Right. But I don't think it should be that divisively defined between being a liberal or conservative. Yeah, it's just so weird to me.  What's the. Because we're divisive about everything. There's there's certain topics like here's a good one, global warming. Like, I guarantee you, man is global. If you had across the board how much of climate change is natural versus how much of it is manmade. And you just just a simple question and you threw that out there, I guarantee if you looked at the numbers and you could get a real accurate assessment of how many conservatives and how many liberals responded.  And I think that if you said is it a hoax, you and you went to the yes side, yes, it's a hoax. It's overwhelmingly conservative.  People don't think it's a hoax or that it's not not an issue.  I think I think the reason for that to a degree is because you have so many people have you have very, very OUTFRONT figureheads who have tried to utilize global climate change as a way to kind of undermine the economic structure in this country. In what way? Like, you know, the green power and all this stuff like that, like like to look at the green deal. To me, that's just economic subversion. It's just trying to entirely change the economic structure of our country being financial.  The new green deal for people don't know what it means, like what they're trying to do. But as far as basically trying to try and replace all of our kind of conservative means of production with respect to energy and replace it with green energy, and I don't think it's I don't think it's completely sustainable and it's not even like it's progressive. It's a complete turnaround, 180. And I think that's irresponsible. Now, here's the thing about that. From my standpoint right now, I consider myself just right of center as far as ideology.  I have not done enough research on climate change. To have a definitive opinion about it. So what I'm telling you is what I'm seeing other people say. And that's why I think there are a lot of people in the conservative aspect of it that are like it's a hoax because they see it as basic economics version. Now, as far as climate change in and of itself, I don't know. I'm probably the last person to talk to about that because I like my car to destroy the environment.  Have you ever driven electric car? Yeah. You drive a Tesla? Yeah. What did you say? You look like you're not impressed.  I don't want to be impressed. You don't want to be impressed. What do you mean? Because I'm like, I want to hear the rumble. Yes. I'm sorry. I love it now. And here's the thing.  The Tesla truck is kind of calling me. It's calling me kind of yeah, I'm still I mean, my favorite my favorite SUV or truck, I call it a truck, is a G wagon. So that is probably the biggest polluter on the planet with respect to D dope.  I love them. Yeah, I absolutely love them. They're so heavy to. Yeah. And I love them.  Yeah. They're dope. The door you have to junk you have to just fall. Yeah. And see that's all. I kind of like that old same thing with the defender.  I get it like defenders of the opposite's aluminum shut the door shows that is actually true. They made a fucking beer can. Yeah but they're so it's a suspension but they look dope. Yeah.  They're doing is they look dope whereas the Mercedes, the G wagon is actually dope.  It's a different display, it's a different animal. The more you drive a G wagon, that motherfucker first of all, super modern like especially the new one, no independent front suspicion. So it handles really well. By the way, none of these fucking suburban housewives are ever taking those goddamn things off roading.  So I don't even know why it ever had to live axles. Right. It's like most of what it is, is like moms are picking up their kids and these fucking rich people. But here's the funny thing about that, because I have I had had sixty three I had a 2013 63 and all the time, like people like that's my dream car, it is my dream.  And then they'd ride in it like, oh it's bumpy, it's terrible. But the new ones aren't the new ones, the ones handle insane and they're so fast for what it is.  Yeah. No I get it dude. It's dope. But going back to the Tesla to me is the future when I drive one of those things. And here's the thing too. When covid the lockdown happened, Los Angeles also not air quality, was fucking amazing.  You could see the mountains. It was crazy.  It was like, oh, my God, what are we doing ourselves? What are we doing to ourselves? I guess everybody had electric cars. That would be the case all day long, every day.  But then some people make the argument that what you need, like the batteries and so forth and so on caused much of destruction is a good argument.  So it's also conflict minerals, you know, getting these from like these poor countries taking take them out of Afghanistan.  And, you know, yeah, I'm I don't know, man. I'm I I have a hard time having this conversation because I'm so biased. Right. And I'm being selfish.  Listen, you go out my garage is shit. I have I've got a lot of muscle cars, man. I love those things. But I also love my Tesla and I drive it all the time. I love it man. I love that. It's silent. I love that it's stupid fast.  I love that it feels like it's from the future. It makes other cars feel dumb than it does.  It's just so advanced. Yeah. No, and you're right. The funny thing is all the reasons why I love the new do are the same reasons that you love the Tesla. Yes, it's my notwithstanding the electric engine. So for me, it's just me not wanting to. I romanticize the idea of car ownership so much and driving in the feel and all of that stuff. You do lose that with some of the electric cars. So that's why I'm kind of hard pressed to kind of completely jump on the electric car bandwagon.  Here's a crazy thing.  Do we look this up? I think we did, because it was something that Jeremy Clarkson said on Top Gear that when the exhaust that comes out of a 9/11 turbo is actually cleaner than the air in a polluted area.  Like if you think I remember him saying, I do drive in downtown L.A. in a 911 turbo, you're actually the exhaust is actually cleaner than the air that's getting sucked into the engine.  So that's how it is possible to make a low emissions combustion pick up the tikhon from Porche. Well, that's electric. Yeah, it is. But I mean, yeah, there was a cause in Dallas. They did the reveal and I was there and done things. Oh, man, I'm not going to lie. I was like, OK, so now this is the this is where we get the marriage between the practical efficiency of electric cars and then be this in Surrell effect of having the old world cars.  That's now it's starting to get that marriage in that balance. Right. Right. That I can make you noise.  Like, look, it accelerates like you can press a button and make Jetson's noises.  Selek as you hit the gas, I get to deal with that. You can't get taken down with the car. Rather you mimic the sound of like an old muscle car.  I can't get down with that.  Yeah, I wouldn't like m threes were doing that. Yeah they did on my M6 and I was like, you know what, you know you're right. Yeah. It was kind of weird. Yeah.  Well that's the problem with Turbo's. They sound whack. Yeah. But you can get so much power out there. Yes. But the IMGs are also Turbo's.  Yeah. Like IMGs Waggons or Turbo. They sound fucking nasty. Yeah. They do figure out how to do it right with the exhaust. That Porsche has not figured that out. Well no they haven't but man they figured out so many other things.  I so much look if you drive one of their naturally aspirated engines, the noise is so glorious. Yeah. You don't ever want to go back to.  The three, yes, all the cars, I mean, I guess they're all those generally are the three things that they make. Yeah, they make they make a beautiful sound.  Yeah, the two are sounds pretty fucking good to Porsche states that under normal driving conditions, this car exceeds 31 miles per gallon and does indeed only produce a maximum carbon output of 300 units. So in retrospect, Jeremy Clarkson's conclusion upon the heavily polluted cities is plausibly correct and therefore quite amazing.  Holy crap. Yeah, because, you know, L.A. is dirty as fuck under normal conditions. Pretty amazing. Thank you, Jamie. Man was better than Jamie.  So heartbreaking. Yeah, it's hard. How about now? And that's what I'm saying.  Did you go down through Hollywood and see all the boarded windows and shit staying in Hollywood?  Oh yeah. Tell me what it's like for someone who hasn't been here since the.  What's that thing? Remember The Walking Dead. Yeah. Kind of close to that. Yeah.  It's it's Hollywood. I mean, Hollywood already dirty anyway. Right. And then you add the board, everything's boarded up. It's kind of like now it's starting to seem a little more lively. Things open back up a little bit.  So it's not as bad, but it's bad enough to go, oh, man, this is bad.  Well, like, there's a friend of mine who is buddies with this photographer, and this photographer is like he whenever shit goes down, he goes out and gets photographs and videos.  And he got this insane video of Hollywood the very night where everybody was smashing and burning everything. It is it's so crazy, really. It's so crazy. This video. I mean, I don't want to share it because it's his personal video, but he's he's walking down the street and he's panning and it's just people smashing windows and things are on fire and people are running out of stores of packages. And and it's all happening on the street in front of and the streets are covered with debris and dirt.  And and he's just he's just panning back and forth with his camera. I'm like, oh, my God. Like, this is Hollywood. This is where I drive to go tell jokes. Like, what is happening?  It's man, dude, it's and it's it's such a beautiful city. Like you can see the beauty through the grime. Yeah. And it's like. I don't know how it bounces back either. No, I don't know what percentage of the small businesses were already on the way out before the rioting and the looting because of the covid fucked up so many businesses, they were estimating that somewhere around 40 percent of small businesses were going to go under.  And then you light everything on fire and looting and all this crazy shit and like, oh, my inch'allah in L.A. was hard to live in an expensive home not to live in, as is.  Well, the taxes are so crazy that California state taxes like thirteen point five percent. Taxes, no ingots. Yeah, not zero.  Same as we mean we get shoegaze that were in the NRA. Different saying when we get crushed with property tax.  Yeah, but we get crushed with that too. You know. You're right. Yeah. Just not on specifically your house, but. Yeah. Yes, it's yeah.  It's like look, there's beautiful parts of L.A. There's this, there's a lot of fun to this place. This, there's a lot of good things. There's a lot of good people. There's a lot of good people because there's a lot of people. But it's one of the problems with it is there's too many folks. I think when you get to a size that's sort of unmanageable, whether it is, you know, New York City or Los Angeles, what whenever things go sideways, they go really, really sideways and fast.  Yeah, fast. And went from zero to 100 with Coleman, like. Yeah. To and not only that, and that was a point that I made too.  With respect to firearm ownership, people don't understand how fast society can collapse. Yes. Even if only temporarily. Right. It happens overnight. Yeah.  That video came out just like that. Mm. Police station on fire. Yeah. I in a whole city was burning. Yeah. And and then but people tell me that I'm ridiculous for wanting to own a firearm.  Yeah. They're ridiculous and they look ridiculous now you know. I mean again, say it again. This is one of the reasons why I wanted to have you on right after it hit. When I contacted you, I was like, this is the time to really talk about this stuff, because this is where people are more open to this idea. We live in a messy world, and I know that there's a lot of good people that don't want guns.  Like I had a conversation with this comedian friend of mine when one of the mass shooting happened and he was like, we just got to take away all the guns. I was like, OK, well, I don't know what to say, but because that's you're so off base, I don't even know what to do with this conversation. I know.  And that's the problem is so many people don't have the conversation emotionally and therefore they start spouting out what essentially is juvenile solutions.  Same guy years later trying to buy a gun.  Stop it now, of course, worried, scared, trying to buy a gun. What do I do? Trying to buy a gun? I want to buy a gun.  They confront a reality. What do I do? Yeah, well, I do. I don't know man. I to see.  But here's the messed up part about it. To take California for instance, like you brought it up earlier in the conversation. Now you have all these people who are panicking, wanting to buy a gun because they feel they need one soon and fast. They can't get it because you have, what, ten day waiting period in California? Right. And these are laws that they voted for.  Well, so they're just waiting nine, eight exactly. Every day check and look out the window. And we saw an entire city go from perfectly functional to on fire in a night. Yeah.  So it's so that's another reason why the whole notion of having waiting periods for me, I'm just like, no, no, I can't get with it.  It's so crazy how everything went sideways, like almost like I'm not a conspiracy theorist. The fact that I did I don't think like I had a really dumb person tried to explain to me that they think that George Floyd was murdered so that the riots could happen there, too. Oh, my God. It's the dumbest argument of all time. Yeah. You got a fucking sociopath who's a known sociopath who just happened to have him arrest a guy that he's already had a personal beef with him.  It's a dumb conversation.  But if if it wasn't, God damn, it's like it's perfect.  It's the perfect storm. You have this. This. Polemic, sort of polarizing president, right, and then you have this disease that comes from another country and he's calling it the Chinese virus and you know, we're already in a trade war talks with China. So you go, wow, imagine if China, like, released this virus.  There's all these crazy if you're one of those people, there's all these crazy conspiracies you can come up with, then the George Floyd murder, which is months into this horrible lockdown where everybody's losing their fucking mind and nobody wants crazy. Yeah, an angry man.  I was watching people driving. They were driving so aggressive I could feel it. The tension, because when people start losing money and there's no way to get it back and then just losing their businesses through no fault of their own. Yeah. And then on top of that, you see a video of a guy getting murdered by a cop.  And it's a slow torture, murder and it's horrific. And then the fucking city explodes. And then what's unprecedented is that the whole world responds.  And when is the whole world responded? Gravy, man, it's crazy.  Like Lord like. And now here we are.  We are two gun enthusiasts, gun shorts on legal age for that one.  Yeah. If you hate me for this now, like, come on, get this. I've you know, I've been a hunter for eight years and I've had guns for more than 20.  I just I don't I don't want anybody to die. I don't want anybody to get hurt. I don't want anybody to cry. I don't want anybody to feel bad. I don't I'm a sensitive person is where it sounds. However, I'm a realist. I understand humans. And I understand that we are a strange animal there.  And we we live in this bizarre state of civilization that has a thin veneer that that thin veneer that protects us from all of our survival instincts and chaos and all of our tribal instincts and our brutality that we have just under the surface.  And I'm very aware of that. You just I'm very I'm very aware of the propensity that human beings have for violence. And that's why I'm a gun advocate and that's why I support people like you. And that's why I want to have these kind of conversations, because I don't I don't think there's enough people looking at it realistically. And I think there's more now. And I think having a conversation with someone who's so well reasoned about this is very important right now.  Yeah, it's it's I don't know why or how it came about, but it's just something I've become really incredibly passionate about. When did you first shoot a gun?  Like, what was the first time? How old do you think it was? Like twenty four. Twenty three. So you were fairly old in terms of.  Oh yeah. No, I was not pro-gun. So it was not what kicked it off shooting. So what what made you go to arrange?  My best friend asked me to go. Yeah, he randomly was like, hey, you want to go shoot? And I was like and I was scared. I was more scared than I was a.. Were you in law school at the time? Yes, I heard it all.  Man stuff starts getting so blurry. I was either in the process of going to law school.  I was already in law school. I can't remember exactly. OK, but after that first shot. Second shot, actually, let me let lie the first I was terrified, second shot, I was like, oh yeah, this now people hate hearing that. Oh yeah. No, no, no, no it's not.  But it's no different for me. The woman dude, the last time I was here, I was in here. I mean, in California, I was in San Francisco, to be specific. I was filming for my show after we finished filming. I decided to stay over for for several days as kind of like a getaway. I rented a Porsche 911 GT three on Turo. Found the most words to tools like a like Airbnb for cars. Oh, so you rented somebody else's car.  They should pay me a lot of money for this right now. So basically, yeah, you can take whatever cars you have left. Yes. Yeah.  So I found the most remote diner in San Francisco I could possibly find for my hotel. I ran just nine, 11 three and I drove about an hour and 30 minutes to this diner, had some eggs, had some oatmeal eight, got back in the car, drove back down to mountain. Went back to my hotel and then the next day I plot out another course and I did the same shit, I drove down to one on one and just drove.  And it was most exhilarating, awesome shit I've ever done in my life.  Why can I have that type of reaction to doing that, but not to shooting a firearm? It's the same thing. Well, I think you should I don't have a problem with it at all. The people that do have a problem with it is this emotional, in my opinion, narrow minded perspective? I think it's it's narrow minded in that.  Well, OK. It's. I think in one way, it's not narrow minded in one way, if you would want to look at it with the best perspective possible, you would hope that we have evolved to the point where we no longer need guns.  No one needs guns all across the land, everywhere in the world. And that might and strength are no longer factors in the way people interact with each other. People will never no no longer threaten people's lives or break down their doors or rape or murder people or steal from them. I would love that. I would love that. Yeah. Look, I think the three of us lived in a world. It was just you, me and Jamie. We would need guns to protect ourselves.  You're a nice guy. Jamie's great. I'm a nice guy. We wouldn't have any problems. Know Jamie wears his hat back. I was fine. He's fine, trust me.  But, you know, I'm saying I mean, that's the problem. The problem is the unknown people that you don't love, people that you don't you don't know anything about them. And then people that look at you like an opportunity or like a victim rather than like a brother or a sister.  That's the problem with people. And that problem largely comes from a bunch of different factors. And one of those factors is overpopulation. One of those factors is we don't need each other, you know, not necessarily as much. And that you look at people that have more than you have and you look at them as somehow or another, they've gotten that through some nefarious way.  That's another perspective thing I've noticed, too. Yes. That that's a mentality that it's way more pervasive than it needs to be. Right. The way that people look at success. I was raised. But my mom and I, to be a fucking failure, to be honest with you, I am like the epitome of having a background where I should be nothing.  My mom was like, look. If them, why not you and not meaning any specific race or any specific type of people, but just anything, if you want something and you see someone that has something that you want to work and figure out a way so that you can get it.  That should be a motivation, not something I look down on and say, well, why do they get to have that? That's not fair. I should have that. I think there's too much of that thought process and mentality in this country. It's a mine disease and I think it's scary.  It's scary because then what it does is it vilify success. And so now, instead of success being something that people aspire to, it's now become something that people attack. Yes. And I think that's incredibly dangerous. Incredibly dangerous.  Yeah, I agree. And it's it's a very weak minded perspective to this one. I mean, there's different kinds of success to write this. The success of someone who built a business versus success of someone who's doing some shady shit with which is true with loans and, you know, and fucking over people with, you know, subprime mortgages. And there's there's different things that make you successful. You know, there's the Wolf of Wall Street money that you get from ripping people off.  But I think that goes without being said, though. Yes, that that's pretty blatant.  But it's also like the gun problem. And people are messy.  They're you know, if everybody was like, you know, we wouldn't have a problem with guns. It's a it's a messy problem that comes with just human beings because we're just weird. People are weird.  No, you're right. And but here's the funny thing, though. I have this kind of utopian vision of this this like mass education on firearms. And the reason I have it, and I know it's a little naive to a degree, but I do believe, like the gun changed the way I looked at the world. And I think the gun michelotto like, you know, how do you change the way you look at the world?  It taught me, even though my mom really kind of beat it into my head, the gun almost served as like a physical symbol, symbol of self-reliance.  Not that I don't need anyone but to trust in my own ability to find a way to deal with any problems that I have. Sometimes that ability means go to somebody who's better at it than you. That can help you do something to learn. Exactly. Or it means find the strength within yourself to overcome an issue that you're dealing with. The gun, show me. And not only that taught me that it taught me responsibility because now we are talking.  However, I want to dignify it as far as the the sporting enthusiasts aspect of it, it's still something. It's life and death that is a tool of life and death that can be used to take a life and can be used to save one. So because of that, that is a big responsibility, especially when I'm carrying that very thing on me everywhere I go.  So it had me really appreciate life more. I started to value life a lot more than most people think.  You get a gun and all of sudden you just want to take life. No, like that. I told you this all time. The day I have to use the gun to defend myself. I'm going to need therapy. Flat out, I'm going to need therapy because it's made me value life. Not that I didn't die like before, but it's something that that brings it to the forefront of your consciousness when you have a gun and you understand what that gun can be used to do.  And so that happens to weigh more people than people realize.  Most people think that people get a gun and they just become reckless murderers. We want to kill everybody when in reality, a number of stories, people out there who I know, a guy who the firearm helped him get out of his depression. I know, I know I sounds crazy, it sounds crazy, but he'll he'll he'll tell you the speech about it and he's and he's very he should be I mean, he grew up in the streets of St.  Louis and he didn't he didn't have a good life. He was young and he was depressed. But then when he got into firearms, that allowed him to deal with his depression because he found something he was passionate about. Isn't that that is crazy.  But that's something that does actually work. When you find something you really love and pursue it and you get some like that's one of the problems I have with the term depression. Like, boy, that's a blanket that you throw over so many different factors, like it's almost like the term drugs.  Like if you say you want drugs.  Yeah, I drank a cup of coffee or drugs. I mean, really. Or are you on heroin. It's really they're both drugs. It's weird. Yeah. But depression is in many ways like that in that there are people and I know these people that have a real problem with their brain and the way the brain produces chemicals, the same way some people have problems with their liver. Some people have they're born with ineffective lungs. These are all just parts of being a person.  Yeah. And some people have legitimate issues that I think they need medication for.  And then there's other people that they just don't feel good and they call it depression because their life sucks and their job sucks.  And no one wants to have sex with them and they don't make money. So they're depressed and they say, I'm suffering from depression. And so what do you do with that?  Well, some of those people get on medication, and I don't know if that's really the answer, because there's a lot of those people that I know that have discovered jujitsu or discovered other things that they yoga, either physical things often because they release endorphins and because they're actually healthy for you. But also you get passionate about something and you see this improvement. And you were talking about that with guns. I was trying to describe to someone why I like shooting guns.  And I said one of the reasons why I like it because I'm not very good at it. Yeah. You know, I like learning things. I like learning all kinds of things.  Yeah. But I'm sure when I started I had a YouTube channel. When I started my YouTube channel, I would go like, oh, I started a thing called IDP's Diaries, which is like a shooting competition. Oh was bad.  But you did it openly.  Yes. Which is great. So people can see, oh, this guy isn't just because I see you now.  It's like if I didn't know anything about Godzilla, you're so good. It's just crazy.  And see, that's what I wanted when I started doing it. I wanted people because I was like, I'm a city boy. I didn't grow up with guns. So when I started putting my when I started my channel, I was like, OK, I know there are a lot of people who are like me, right? And so I want them to be able to feel to be able to relate to the idea of, OK, I'm starting afresh and I'm not that good.  So the YouTube channel was almost a way to analyze my growth.  And if you start from video one and you go to my last video, you can literally watch the entire progression. And that's what I wanted it to be. So I knew and I was it was hard because I knew I was going to look bad. Yeah, real bad. And I started with video one for ADP Diaries. And then as time went on, I stopped doing the diaries, but I was still shooting in front of the camera. And even to this day, I'm known for not editing out my missus.  Hmm.  I would you still going to see me, Miss Ellie? There are some people in this life is hard because I do so much shooting now. There's an expectation that I should be good. So when I go out and do a gun review and I'm missing with a particular gun and I see comments made, you can shoot with that gun. You know, it does hit my ego a little bit. Don't read the comments.  You know, that's the key.  Yeah. I mean, you're on the right path. You have great content, so don't read the comments. Yeah. Do your best. Don't read the comments. I think I know.  And I've started doing it actually. I've cut it. I've cut it by 50 percent. So important. So important for mental health really.  Is it really because you don't realize how much of an effect it's having until it starts having an effect? Yeah. And then you're like, why am I such in a shitty mood all the time?  It's just a terrible way to communicate with people, you know, through through little text messages on comments. You don't even know them, you know anything about them. They're saying mean shit.  Do you die to me? Tell you something, the audacity of anonymity is insane. It is. That's a great way to put it.  It's a great way to put it. The audacity of an entity. Yeah. Yeah. Anonymous people can get away with a lot.  A lot. It's also it's like a shitty way to communicate with people personally. It's bad for you to shit on people like anonymous little comments on someone's Instagram page or the YouTube channel. It's shitty. Shitty for you. It's bad for you.  And like I said before, like I grew up girl, my friends are assholes, so I know how to give it back. But but if I do it now, I'm a bully, right?  That's the problem. If you give it back and then people will find you as a target in the start coming after you. Yeah. You can't do that. You can't do that. Yeah. It's you better off just ignoring it. Yeah. Just keep moving. Do your best. Keep moving. That's, that's, that's the plan now.  Yeah. That's the plan because I mean it's so the platform so big now to try to let all that in.  I'm going to look like it's going to affect me much. How many Instagram followers you have right now? Six hundred and twenty four thousand. Imagine that in a room.  Imagine a room with six. Imagine, like, the amount of like how many? Like a giant football arena. It's like what? Jamie, you would know this. What's like a big ass football arena?  Fifteen.  OK, imagine six of them bitches. Six of them.  And that's just like food you do for it is all over. You fucking lose or you can eat shit with that gun. Imagine all that. No, there's too many people that's unmanageable. Here's how bad, how bad it was.  I was reading Instagram comments, the YouTube comments where I have one point four million oh Facebook where I have one point three million Dodt one hundred and eight thousand on Twitter. So I was going back and forth reading all of that. Oh my God. And I was just I hit a point one day. I was like, dude, this is not healthy.  So Facebook, that's the entire city of Austin. The entire city was. And fuck you.  Fuck you. You can't do that. It's not you can't do that.  And no one can manage that. No, they can't. Yeah. It's just too many people. It's too much opportunity for people to suck, which is true. Yeah.  Face to face is the best way to talk to people always.  If I'm going to be honest, I think some of it is my ego where I think I can handle it.  It's like just this false sense of of stability that my ego has. It's like I can handle Atkisson, I can handle it.  But the war of attrition is real. It's still energy. It's coming at you whether you like it or not. It's still energy. It is. And if it's negative, it's going to feel bad. Yeah, it might not feel as bad as it will for someone who's mentally unstable. And I've seen some comedians who just get really crushed by comments and it's horrible. Yeah, man. Like they come on the show and then they read.  I go, don't read the comments like Donnell Rawlings when he was on with the rizza from Mutans. I said after the well done, I was just he's a wild motherfucker and he's funny as shit and he's always loud and he's just crazy.  Don ls crazy, but he was talking over the is a bunch of times and people I know they were going to get mad and he I love Donelle.  So when he was doing that I was just laughing my ass off. I thought it was awesome. That was a great podcast.  And then at the end I said don't read the comments. I hugged him like, Oh that was great man. Don't read the comments.  He's like, You fucking told me. He told me not to read the comments or do. Sometimes it's really hard because you know what it is?  Sometimes it's your own fault, because what you would you go to do is to get your ego stroked.  That's really what you're doing. Yeah. You're really going on there hoping everyone was like, man, he was awesome. What a great. Yeah, yeah.  I'm a big guy now. And then you get up there like you said, and you're like, oh shit.  Yeah. You're like, oh right. OK, yeah. Yeah.  I'm too polarizing to read the comments because people either love me or they fuck. Yeah. Which is true. I've learned that. Yeah it's weird. So I just go OK, I'm just going to keep doing what I do.  Something's going right. I think. I don't know man.  It's just a little bit, I mean I think, I think you could step it up a little bit, you know. Do you know just start up a little bit. Try to do my best.  I really am. I mean, I'm not I'm not a fan of me. Yeah. You know, I don't like what I do. I think I could always do better. You know, it's funny. A lot of people don't realize that people who put themselves out like, you know, funny, kind of like you. And I often feel like even though we may kind of get affected by your comments, they're never anywhere close to as being as bad as what we tell ourselves in our heads.  Oh, for sure we are. I had the worst self talk on the planet.  Yeah. Like it's bad. It's toxic. I do too.  Yeah. But I think that's also what drives you. Yeah. You know, it's just like I have good self love to look.  I'm not as much as a more because I have a problem in that I'm, I don't want to say I'm too driven, but I'm, I get very focused on things and especially things that I'm trying to get good at.  Yeah. And things I take seriously, whether it's stand up or whether it's doing this podcast or other things that I do UFC commentary. And so if I fall short, I'm very hard on myself. Yeah.  So that if I read other people that also are mad at me for falling short and it piles on like what's the matter, I'm right there with you, you know, like you're going to get an argument from me whether or not I suck, like I'm right there with you.  Yeah. I'm pretty terrible. Everything I've ever done wrong, I'm fucking furious at myself for. Yeah.  I'm the same way. Yeah, I'm the same way. And it's like it's nothing's ever enough. No nothing's.  I mean I can have any, any type. This can't be healthy but any type of thing I succeed at or anything that I do that is a milestone that people are like oh this is awesome.  It last maybe ten seconds and I'm like, all right, you need to do better.  Yes. But that's also why you're really good at things. And this is another thing that you see from people that are mediocre. And it infuriates me.  They come up with excuses for why they fall short. Yeah, they come up with excuses for why they didn't succeed in their chosen profession. They come up with excuses for why other people do well, but they've been ostracized or they've been cast out. They never were accepted or they were treated like a second class citizen. No, you were mediocre.  You're mediocre and you're not critical on yourself. Yeah. And I don't you know, I don't wish that on anybody.  It's true. I mean, it is what it is. And I think it's you have to get past I call it the ego wall. You have to get past ego because there just some shit you're just not good at. Right. And so it's either one or two things. You either pivot, find something you're good at and go that direction. Or if you're willing to put any effort, figure out how to get better at what you're not good at.  Right. And then and then apply those things now is going to be hard. It's going to suck. You still may not even get to the same level of degree as somebody else who's naturally talented in it in that sense.  But what's the alternative bitch about it? And like you said, complain, complain, complain.  When I see people particularly this happens when you see people who are not very good commenting on people who are successful, they start saying this is one of the reasons why I could never make it, because the people that there are sellouts or they're this or they're that and like, OK, you know, who doesn't leave comments like that? Winners. This is so true. That's the fact.  That's the Dave Chappelle is not going on fucking Twitter talking shit about people. This is that's the facts. It's the people who are really successful are the ones who are analyzing themselves, looking at their own work and keep moving. Doesn't mean you don't fail, doesn't mean you don't fuck up. You don't make mistakes.  And I think the difference, though, is you do it publicly. Yeah. You mess up publicly. Oh, yeah. That's a lot to take in. And like even like when I went on when I was on, I mean, when I was on Bill Maher and I was on a roundtable, I didn't think I did a good job.  I don't it's fucking almost impossible to do a good job in that goddamn roundtable. It was it was probably my worst showings now for reasons that I think I went into it thinking I could I went into it like a lawyer. I thought I can go on reason and maybe understand I was out class because they had a great command of using emotion and clapping.  Well, there's that. Yeah, they're teachers. They got one on the board for us.  Yeah. I don't think it's a good way to communicate.  And I said it would bill on the show and he's trying to talk me into doing the show and I think I agreed to it, but then I found ways to get out of it.  This is why man talking one on one is hard enough like you have a thought. Sometimes you're expanding and I have a thought. I'm holding on to it. But then you keep talking and I don't know when to get it in there. I lose it now when there's three other fucking people and they're all trying to get sound bites they're hoping are going to be on YouTube, all performative. It is a lot of it, a lot of his performative.  And then on top of it, it really is performative because there's a fucking audience. Yeah, you're right. And yeah. And they're all liberal and they're all clapping and cheering and they're all and which they should be. They're his fans. There's nothing wrong with that. A couple times I wanted to be, but I'd make a point and I'm like, really, you're not going to clap.  It's a bad way to communicate in front of people like that is one thing to perform if you're doing standup or singing a song or something like that in front of a large crowd, that's one thing.  Yeah, but like having conversations in front of crowds, it's like a weird animal man, weird added element, and you're appealing to others to chime in and reinforce your your thoughts.  Yeah, no, no, you're absolutely right. Now, I will forever, ever, ever be grateful that he gave me the opportunity to go into that lion's den, because it's a place that I think a lot of pro-gun people haven't been able to get go to. Hopefully I communicated in a manner that was that resonated with a lot of people in the same same way here.  It's I'd be lying if I said I did not value the ability to have for the time being within this two hour, three hour space to have access to your audience at the same time. Because I. I don't understand why. I mean, I understand why, but I'm just passionate about this in a way that sometimes even I have a hard time articulating. And so when I see all of these new people, because I know your audience is very vast, like I have a base, there is a base in my audience, the gun people.  And a lot of them are very conservative. And with your audience, it gives me the ability to speak to a. Wider gap of people who would otherwise never even look in my direction because of what I talk about and so in aren't that many platforms that are available right now that are willing to open their doors to the opposite perspective, because you've got it. You made me a smart guy. You know, this this puts you in a very peculiar situation.  You can end up looking really bad because you're literally confronting and testing out all of your ideas right in front of your audience that thinks you know everything. Right. And so many people aren't willing to do that because they're worried about looking bad, which is why I get mad props to Bill Maher as well, because there aren't too many platforms. Most people just want to sit in their echo chambers, yell at the audience and say, all right.  Right. Yeah, so I can't I have a hard pressed to think about any other type of platforms that may have a different perspective that would let me come on like this. And that's just me being honest.  Well, I think it's important to talk to people that have all sorts of different ideas. You know, the thing there's the thing going on today where people talk about giving someone a platform.  You shouldn't be giving them access to your platform, like, well, what the fuck is the purpose of a platform if it's not to test out ideas? If it's not like if you want to talk to someone, I mean, I'm not talking about someone like who's in the KKK. I mean, but talking to people that have controversial viewpoints, one of the best ways to sort those viewpoints out is to challenge them there.  And in fact, there's a lot of people that would support a lot of these people that I've had on where I've confronted them on their ideas.  And they lost a lot of fans because of it, because of it, because these ideas now fall apart under scrutiny under someone who could talk to you for long periods of time and just start go, OK, well, why do you think that? And then they say this and that and then you go, but where's that coming from? Yeah. And then they see this now and then as you get deeper and deeper, you get to the basement and you go, oh, this is a shit, there's nothing in here.  It's gone. I mean but I think the problem too is, is that people don't understand. You can't know everything. Right. So, for instance, we started talking halfway through. We started talking about climate change. Right. My, my, my, my knowledge of climate change is very limited. Very limited.  You're going to point I'm like, dude, I don't know know most of mine's pretty limited, too. Yeah. So but I think probably some people have this expectation where they they tell themselves where I have to know this because people expect me to know. And if I say that I don't know, then I'm going to lose. And look, I may I don't know, maybe there's some die hard climate. Maybe, you know, somebody can make an argument that says, OK, well, yeah, that's because most people don't follow you for climate change, right?  Sure.  The climate change argument to me is one of the things that's really fascinating about it, as I think and I mean this in a very this is is hard to grasp this, but this is this is the way I'm going.  I'm going to try to parse this out.  I think it's a control issue and I don't think it's a control issue and meaning that people are trying to control people and that people are trying to gain control of one very small factor in our mortality. And I think it's good to do that. I think it's good to make the world cleaner. And I think it's good to use clean energy and I think it's good to use solar.  I think all these things are good, but I think we're fucked anyway.  I think we're fucked anywhere because of solar flares and volcanoes and earthquakes and tsunamis and asteroids and pandemics. I think we're fucked anyway. And I think if you look at the history of the world, there's been radical changes before we ever came about, whether it's asteroid impacts or massive fucking ice ages or all kinds of crazy shit that's killed off people from the beginning of fucking people. There's been a lot of them. And if you think that switch in totally to solar is going to stop all that other shit from happening, you got another thing coming.  It doesn't mean that solar is not good, doesn't mean that cleaning the air is not good. I think these are very important factors. But the idea that it's going to save us. But that's why I said that's why I say I think based on my limited knowledge, with respect, I like the New Deal, things of that nature. I think some of it, if not more of it seems to me economically subversive.  I don't know. I don't know about that. I've heard a lot of criticisms about the Green New Deal. Yeah, most of them were from Republicans. I haven't heard any criticisms. I would like to hear criticisms from Democrats that don't support it.  But I think the the idea behind green energy is great. I do, too. It'd be wonderful. You know, we had electric cars, less pollution.  You know, the real what's really crazy is the best energy is really fucking nuclear has the least amount of impact, just as they did a pretty sucky back in the Fukushima days.  They didn't know what they were doing. I mean, they they the energy that they have now when it comes to nuclear is really fucking good.  We do very small in fucking our massive citizenship's. I can't believe I forgot.  We called our, you know, our big warships, the carriers aircraft carrier.  I mean, submarines as well. I mean, that's just insane.  Yeah, they're nuclear. Yeah.  Like I said, this is out of my wheelhouse, you know, like I got a business partner. He's the electrical engineer who may be able talk to you about that crap, but I don't know about it either.  When they say nuclear submarine, that that goes in one ear and she comes flying out the other. My stupid brain, I don't know. But I only I only I only know about them in the past.  Everybody from like I watch it, like, I tend to like drink and then watch like documentaries on Netflix, about two World War Two and stuff like that. Yeah. I oddly watch a lot of Hitler documentaries because the manner in which the people.  But it's so fascinating, scary, very scary way. It's scary.  The strong leader, the amount of power a strong leader has over whether it's it's Kim Jong un or, you know, any. That's the thing I keep saying to people when they don't think that all that shit can happen.  Yeah, man, I'm like, listen, they're human beings in twenty twenty and human beings in twenty twenty are under the control of a military dictatorship. That's that's happening right now. And it's happening in more than one country. It's a it's a style of civilization that exists and has existed since the beginning of time.  I don't want it to happen here. People don't understand our our way of living is still a baby. Yep.  It's still a baby compared to the other structures that are out there in the world. Yeah, and that's an experiment.  Yeah, it's experiment in self-government. And, you know, a lot of people like this experiment should be canceled. Let's get rid of it or start from scratch and do the same shit that didn't work before.  I don't know, man. I mean, I don't think we could start a new country, you know? I mean, I know this trying to Chaz is supposed to be a new country, but I bet you didn't even building those buildings.  You're basically doing the exact same thing that we did to the Native Americans.  Didn't even take a week. They built borders, people with guns, people up for non-complying.  They they bad cops. They had they stood up for taking pictures like, come on, man, you'd be so pissed off.  The cops did that. Oh, God, it's it's human. It's a human issue. I think humans have control over humans. I've told the story. Forgive me if you've heard it before. I used to work as a security guard for a short period time when I was 19 years old. I worked at Great Woods Center for the Performing Arts. It's this Mansfield, Massachusetts amphitheater that all these concerts are. I saw Jon Bon Jovi there or Bon Jovi, the band I saw I saw Bill Cosby perform there.  I saw a lot when I was working there, I saw a lot of shit. And I developed in a very short period of time. Most of the guys that I got the job because one of the guys that I trained with my taekwondo school was a security guard who said, hey, you want this job? It pays really good, real easy. You get to see concerts. Yeah. And I was like, OK, so he hired they hired like a bunch of black belts to be security.  So it was yeah. It was like a bunch of us that the black belt in martial arts. OK, yeah. Like mixed martial arts. No, I was talking ok.  This is like before this was 1986. I was 19. So it was eighty six. Yeah.  I was like just a bunch of karate people. Yeah. Right. So we're out there and we almost instantly developed this us versus them mentality. Almost instantly we would yell at people when they were doing things wrong. We treat them like shit and I recognized that. I was like wow, this is weird.  Like instantly I become like I've developed this attitude that these people, because they didn't want to listen, they kept doing things they're not supposed to do and you're supposed to enforce it and you get mad and you do have some power because you have the security jacket on. So stupid. You have a walkie talkie.  The first day I was there, this kid stole a golf cart first day.  And this guy, who was the head security guy, his name was Alleycat, tackled his dude and beat the shit out of him with a walkie talkie. He beat this guy in the head with a walkie talkie. My first day on the job, I was like, oh, OK. So that's how we're doing it.  Like, this is great. And again, I'm a fucking child, 19 years old. I'm a moron. I don't know anything. And but I was smart enough to recognize, like, this is weird, like this this attitude that we have all developed as a security team, this us versus them now magnify that times a fucking hundred million and you get coopting.  Oh yeah.  Wasn't there a social experiment done like this famous social experiment like that. Yeah. Yeah. Gotcha. Gotcha. Yeah. They immediately started abusing the inmates, treating them like shit.  And it's funny because it's like so like I was allowed the temple, you know, he calls, he calls it laughing when the is great. Yeah. Yeah. I loved him of it.  This is funny because it's like how quickly, how quickly they relegate themselves to doing the exact same shit that they were critiquing and 100 percent they're pretending to be progressive when they have borders.  Yeah. Like let everybody any fucks like but they wanted to control it.  Well how do you control things. You control things with borders. How do you reinforce your ideas. Well, you have to beat people up.  This is fucking crazy. It's fucking crazy. It's like these are it's like you're doing it's almost like a petri dish. You do an experiment. So this is a human lab. And in this this lab is failing.  I know people think like people watch you do what you do, and especially when they don't realize you've been doing this for years and they like he doesn't do shit. It's about a microphone and talk. All right, I want you to come on camera, find somebody who you even kind of sort of agree with, have a three hour conversation with them and then keep it engaging during the entire conversation and see how long you last and then do that multiple times a day.  It's not that easy, but it's something you get better at. Yeah, I know that's what's weird, but you got better at it through repetition.  Yes. And so in funny, we kind of talked about this the last time I was here.  And the problem is, is that when you only watch the end result of your repetition and getting to where you are now, people oversimplify what it is that you do. And so what happens is they think they can do better, even though they haven't engaged in the same level of repetition or thought process to really think it out. So what I think is happening is you got all these kids with these grandiose ideas, right? They go to these schools, these grandiose ideas from first time like this is why we can do it just right.  We can do it. And then like, yeah, yeah, give us the country. We can do it a lot better than they can.  Oh, really? OK, well you see the result of that. You have Seattle and things go shit like that, and the funny thing is it's going to shit while still having the support structure of an entire city. Yeah, it's not like they don't have the resources of the of the city to be provided was basically a tumor, basically.  And so it's like if I was the government, I'd be pumping guns into them. Like, you guys need guns, you should get explosives.  You guys here's some money for biological weapons or some anthrax, because if I'm trying to collapse, the crazy thing is the founding fathers understood that human nature, that there's always if there's a vacuum of power, there's always going to be someone or something willing to fill it. Yes. And then if left unchecked, it will become a black hole of power, which is why they tried to organize our country the way that they did by separating the powers to serve as a check against other other entities.  People don't really appreciate the beauty of that because they think that they can go into things altruistically and think that, OK, now I'll get a taste of power. I think you think money is intoxicating. Power is a whole nother thing.  Like you pointed out, even on a minor level of being a security guard at a concert. It's intoxicating. Yeah. Now, imagine being in charge of millions of people, right? Oh, come on, man.  Being a general, that can lead people people more. Yeah, you could decide to just fucking light up this city. Yeah, that's nuts.  It's not in people. I don't think people have a big enough appreciation for how intoxicating power really is. Exactly.  And I think that's one of the reasons why you need a stringent evaluation process before you let someone be a police officer instead of just like trying to recruit people.  It should be something where you don't want to recruit people.  You want to say, listen, a man's job for you, you know, you've got you've got to jump through hoops and ladders to get this fucking job.  I think the problem, though, is it's we kind of have to measure that against.  The problem is that means there will be less cops. Yes, and we don't exactly have an overemphasis. We don't not like we have too many cops now. Right. So it's like we know like how do we balance that? Right.  And then what do we do? But the places where they want to defund the cops, where they're voting overwhelmingly in Minneapolis to defund the police department, I mean, I don't know what that means. Let them eat cake.  Oh, man. I don't like because it's like if you're what do you do when they're doing it to themselves? I don't know.  But it's like there's good people that live in Minneapolis. The future.  They're really concerned that, yeah, you're right, because there's a lot of people that like in the gun debate or in the gun discussion that, you know, when we talk about places like California and people are like, oh, it's not fair. The gun laws here suck and a lot of people who live in Texas are living more free or states like will move. It's not that easy. No, it's not always that easy. So you're right.  So I take that back because you're right, there are a lot of people in these places that don't really have a say and they can't just meet they can't just leave.  Well, especially now, right. Because post covid, most people are broke. Yeah. There's a lot of people that didn't work at all for three fucking whole months. They went through all their savings.  Right, to try to move now and then. Also, where's the jobs where that is?  Are you going to where you go? Yeah. Yeah.  If you're stuck in Minneapolis and they defund the cops, I'm like, oh my God, you better buy some bullets. You better get get some guns and get some bullets and get some friends who also have guns and form a small militia.  But you don't need that. The Founding Fathers had muskets. How much you hate that argument? The Founding Fathers, they wrote that back when they had muskets.  But then we'll be so quick to invalidate the notion that, well, you know, they also wrote it when they only had quill pens through, you know. Yeah. And parts of parchment. Yeah, I don't like that. So we're by candlelight. Bingo. Yeah. All right. Fucking dope.  When they know they don't have no Internet. It's amazing how really well thought out their their system of government was. Seriously, consider the fact that we still use it in 2020.  I think it's I think it's beautiful. It is perfect. No, not perfect at all.  Nothing with people involved is it. Not exactly. Nothing. And and I said that I used to say that when I was in law school and I talked about the law, the practice, the law and the idea that I was like, theoretically, the justice system is perfect. It's just executed by imperfect people. Yes, the concepts are perfect. Just when you add the element of people who are imperfect, then that inherently is what creates the imperfection in the system.  Right in the system is designed to sort of mitigate the actions of people. Exactly. And it's done a pretty fucking good job of thinking about how goddamn old it is. Yeah.  Yeah. Now, like I said there, you know, people do fall through the cracks and then there are you know, there are some things that are deteriorating as a result of it. And those things need to be addressed. But by and large, people need to understand that like it's the two hundred and forty four years old or whatever the fuck it is, like, God damn, it's old.  It's really old. It's crazy. I guess it's young compared to other. Oh yeah. Those systems, those fucking dummies.  Think about how they're doing it. Let's what's going on in China. That's the oldest one we got. Yeah.  And that's crazy man. The government and all businesses are intertwined inexorably. You want to run a corporation. Great. You work for the fucking government. You imagine. Could you imagine. And people are wondering why they don't want to let Wall weigh in. Like I've had people explain that to me, like like companies that have been accused of using third party back doors to steal data and espionage and all kinds of shit. That's why they won't let them sell their cell phones here.  Like that's a part of it. That's a branch of the Chinese government you like. They're not really a corporation.  It's like free and independent, like Apple or or, you know, and I don't even know how independent they are. And they get to a certain size. That is truly probably the most shocking at some point. Hey. Oh, yeah. Like there is access to data. There is. There is such thing as being too big. Yeah.  Yeah. Well especially when you're dealing with information like with Google and you know, and Apple and you're collecting so much data and the government would love to take a look at that stuff.  We could save a lot of lives if we could just see what this man's browser history is and all the beautiful pretext to tyranny.  We can save lives. And that is that that is. Yeah, man, I can't get down with that.  I know I can't get down with it either, but it's like, what do we do? What do we do to keep it from sliding into the abyss?  I mean, get a gun.  I don't know. I get a little too extreme for me now. I don't know. I can make that like you couldn't have made five months ago. People would be really good.  But now people like me. Hmm.  It's a it's bittersweet. It's very bittersweet because I hate that it had to come to this for.  People to kind of start realizing it, right, but I can't be too surprised, I've been preaching it for how long now that this could possibly happen. Right. So it's kind of I shouldn't be too surprised, but it's still kind of bittersweet. My only thing is right now is I just I just for all the new people, I implore you. Go out, I know, I know times are hard, money money's tight, but if you have the ability at a bare minimum, get on YouTube and just Gheorge, there's so much information, even though YouTube has done a good job of trying to like, you know, filter the shit out.  You can still search, you can still get there. You could just search, literally search what you were thinking. They're definitely not promoting you. Definitely not promoting, you know, like this.  This video will never hit the trending section of YouTube. No one else didn't, though. Elon Musk.  Well, yeah, he's he's so controversial.  Yeah. So they party decide what trends and what doesn't trend. Yeah.  I like Elon. I love him. He's awesome. Yeah.  I still I need, I still need. I think we should have a conversation where I can sit down and talk to him about these electric car stuff.  But what do you say to him. He makes awesome electric cars bro.  Can you make can you make a non-electric car as awesome as the electric car. I know, I know all about it.  I'm being facetious. I think if you got a hold of one of them roadsters when they come out, you'd be all.  And I don't doubt I don't doubt that. Keep in mind, I'm telling you I'm being willingly stubborn about this.  I know. Yeah. Yeah, I'm right with you. A lot of my friends are right with you to a lot of my friends, like, no, no, I need an exhaust note. I need a rumble. I need to feel it. Yeah, I get it. I get it. It's it's it's magical, man.  There's something to it that's undeniable. It's also very American.  Yeah. They're all a VA.  Oh that's American.  It's fun when I drive my Corvette, my 65 Corvette, I feel like a goddamn bald eagle, you know, it's like that's as American as it gets sixty five Corvette.  Oh, you can't I can't beat it man. No, can't be. Can be. I mean also you can shoot and beat it but that's up there too.  That's another thing that people don't want to hear. No I don't want to hear that. But there's a thrill to shooting.  I mean think about it like, like I've taken some courses, like of course, I take in New Mexico, we're shooting out to six hundred sometimes a thousand meters. That's crazy nutty. But so far.  And it's but then you also talk about how beautiful it is.  People love long range shooting. They get very addicted.  I'm getting there when you get a thousand yards. What's the amount of time between Boom and think man, it's it's extremely noticeable. But here's where we're really trippy. I don't know the exact seconds because it all depends on you're talking about different bullet speeds. We should tell people, Waddington's, you're hitting me. I'm still talking. Yeah.  So the crazy thing is when you're watching it through your optic, you see the paper trail.  Yes. You see the paper trail and then you see the impact, but you don't hear anything.  And then you see it and you're like, whoa, it takes time for it to come back to you because sound travels slower.  Yeah, it's crazy. It's literally traveling faster than the speed of sound. People realize that. Yeah.  And it's not Imman. And and then you take that, you couple that with being in a beautiful environment.  Oh my gosh. You can't beat it. Yeah.  I've shot at the range. I've really only shot rifles up till like 200 yards and that you hear boom dink.  Yeah. So there is a difference though. It's not instantaneous. Yeah. You still do. You still get the delay because otherwise you wouldn't even hear the dink, you would just be drowned out by the blakley, which is how, which is a lot of times it's like that's how suppressors work.  Right, because people think suppressors make things super, super, super quiet. They really don't work because all the suppressor doing it is it's it's mitigating the noise at the muzzle. Right. And people don't realize that when a bullet breaks the sound barrier, you get a crack. So when you shoot a gun, typically speaking, you're hearing two sounds at once. You're hearing the bullet leave the muzzle and then you're hearing the crack of the bullet break the sound barrier because it's traveling that fast.  So it's like a cow, but it's happening. It it sounds like it's happening at once auditorily. Right. So when you put a suppressor on it, people are surprised because once it mitigates the noise that the muzzle, all you're hearing is the sound of the action. If it's not a bolt action and then you're hearing the bullet break, the sound barrier. Right. And so it's kind of kind of cool, actually, when you when you hear it.  Now, granted, you don't want to do that too much because so damaging to your ears, that's what about a suppressor with subsonic.  So that's the only one where it actually gets really damn quiet. But the problem is, is unless you're shooting a bolt action, the sound of that bolt smacking back and forth is loud as hell to.  But what about a pistol? Same thing, because it's yeah.  You get you get the sound of the other side rocking back and forth. So unless you're shooting a bolt action, you want to go, you want to get as quiet as possible, use a bolt action. What's the action with subsonic rounds?  The opposite of a suppressor is a muzzle break. And I have a rifle with a muzzle brake and it mitigates the kick.  Yeah, but it also oh, it's so loud.  People get mad. Yeah. Because you got because you're you're outside of the cone. Of the blast, right, and so everybody on the side of you is getting hit by that blast, fucked up by the last minute, they're really loud, but it makes shooting a gun so much more enjoyable.  Yeah, it's like 50 percent less recoil. Yeah. Yeah. Really feels like so it's like either one just oppressor's do the same thing to mitigate the recall to.  So OK, so you can go pressor or you can go now.  And I tell people all the time the whole suppressor thing, I think that's a that's a health issue. I think so too. I think it's healthy for your ear. Yeah.  Yeah. Like this loud man. Like people don't realize they have this ignorant idea that people are going to sneak up on people shooting. No one's going to hear anything. You mean the same way people do with knives. Yeah.  Yeah. Do you buy them everywhere. Like but I mean they think it's going to be like the movie. Yeah.  It doesn't happen like that now. It's not pretty. Like, like I told you, like I don't shoot when I shoot supressed I still wear ear protection. Oh yeah.  Like people were like are you wearing like people in my videos. Like why are you wearing hair protection and you're allowed.  They hunt with suppressors and they do it out of courtesy. See the other people. Yeah. Yeah. I mean look, it really would be good for people if they had suppressors, but it's a thing in California. I think they're totally illegal. Yeah. Oh no you can't. But that's but I think it's also an ignorant thing. I think it's people that don't understand. Well, because you had guns, because you have people making policies based on movies.  Right, exactly.  VS well, you know, do defense.  This is where we actually make the movies so well. They're very influenced by them here.  They used to make movies here. They're making less of them and less of them here because the tax Texas.  Yeah, they're eating. California's eating itself.  Yeah it is. Now like I don't understand that.  It's such a beautiful place. It is beautiful. It'll be all right.  It'll bounce back. Maybe as soon as I get the fuck out. I don't know. I don't know. But I think the suppressor thing is a really dumb argument. I don't. But they're trying to do almost everything to limit the amount of options that someone who wants to have a gun has here.  See, that's another thing that people don't talk about because people are talking about, oh, it's just it's just a law to make it a little bit harder. Well, that that should aggregate. And at a certain point, would you start doing start pricing people out of the market? Right.  And so if you start adding because all of these laws, they're not they're not free, like background checks aren't free.  People don't realize that they're not free. So you have all of these little these little fees and taxes and all the stuff you and I not going to have a problem paying for.  But, you know, who will people who live in shitty environments and don't have a lot of money. That's who's going to have a problem buying guns for protection, who arguably probably need more, right. And people don't understand or think about that or people don't understand. Oh, well, these are just reasonable laws and there's nothing unreasonable. Yeah, but see, here's the problem. You stack them on top of each other. It just becomes more of a barrier to firearm ownership that a lot of times a lot of these laws are designed to make it so hard and annoying to own a gun that you just don't want to do it.  It's just too much. And people like, why don't you like mandated training? Well, because I've already seen what they've done with other laws. So all that's going to happen is they're going to start off with saying, OK, you need three hours of mandated training, then it's going to be for there's going to be seven. Then another shooting will happen, 20 now.  As somebody who is an entrepreneur, who can, generally speaking, make their schedule, maybe they may be able to do that. Somebody's working two jobs. Four or five to nine, they can't there's no way they're going to be able to satisfy that, right. You know, and people don't think about the real implications of that. And so in an even even then, even from an inner city perspective, people who are talking about policing that that we police the inner city too much.  Well, where do you think they're going to go and enforce these laws if we have more of them? Where do you think they're going to enforce them? They're not they're not going to to to Malibu to enforce gun laws. They're enforcing them in South Central. Like, I mean, that's just what it is, so people don't think about the actual real consequences of these laws, they look at them and say, oh, well, it's not that that bad.  It's pretty reasonable.  No. OK, what about the other 10, 11, 12 other laws on top of that that were considered just reasonable?  I think so many people are just buying the party narrative, whatever the party narrative is, you know, whether it's the party narrative that we don't need guns, guns should be eliminated. Any guns are bad. They don't have, like, this nuanced, very detailed perspective on what what gun ownership actually is.  And the reason they don't is because of the way we have the conversation right now. The conversation is on their side, on their side, and we throw shit at each other. But the problem also is.  Who controls most of the mass media liberal people, exactly in a weird bubble in most parts, why your shadow?  And that's what it is. That is what it is. But it's not, man. I have like it's like I look at stuff and like I look I look at my numbers and then I look at it compared to people who are like in I don't know, like tech.  They make tech videos and stuff like that. And I'm like, oh no tsampa, but I guarantee all the videos and monetize well.  Shalal Banning's real. Yeah. You know, it's real on Instagram. It's real on YouTube, it's real on Twitter. It's real and all those things. Yeah.  And it, there's really not much that we can do. I mean what I mean I know what I do. I just, I pivot. Yeah. You know one thing that's happened before, like they'll just keep shutting it, shutting doors on me and I just try to pivot and figure it out. But now what I've done is that like which emphasizes the importance of having your own independent platform.  It does. It does. And we just hit three hours. Believe it. Oh shit. Really started three thirty.  But I just wanted to say I think you're doing a great job and I think, you know at all the people that are promoting guns and you do it in, in my opinion, the most reasonable and well thought out perspective.
