All right, my guest today is one of the best people on Earth, I love him as much as any person I've ever loved.  He's amazing.  We have the best conversations and we've been having them for many, many years. He used to be the he used to be the guy that you called up at the Comedy Store and you would leave your availabilities, you know, you'd say, hey, I'm going to be in town Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, whatever. And Duncan won't answer the phone to mean he and I would have these crazy long conversations while he was working at the Comedy Store.  And then we started doing the road together. He's just a brilliant person, very unique and interesting. And I'm just happy. I'm happy he's who he is. And it's always awesome to see him.  Please welcome the great and powerful Duncan Trussell government podcast, The Joe Rogan Experience, trained by Joe Rogan podcast My Night All Day.  It's hilarious that your biggest concern is getting stuff in your beard and not telling you about it.  You've got a strange one going on, man, because you kind of like trimming the sides a little bit and then you're puffing out here sort of a bow tie fashion.  You're looking at this struggle between who I was and who I am. Why am I doing this? It's the pandemic I got, like, let the pandemic beer go all the way. And yet there's still this sense of, like, we've got to keep civilization.  I can't live like what's next if it goes all the way up, you know, what's going to start happening?  I'm already gardening. Now, what's next? You know, where does it go?  How crazy can you go in a compound now that you're a father and this craziness went down and you protection, protection, instincts, protective instincts kick in. Have you been thinking about moving elsewhere?  Yeah. I mean, yeah, I was thinking about that like Asheville before Aliette. We thought of Nashville, Nashville.  We've got Georgia. We've you know, we it's it's a constant consideration as especially when you have a kid and aside from like apocalyptic prep or bullshit, there's just a general feeling of like, you know, I think if I were a little boy, I wouldn't want to be in a place where there's creeks and places that I can run and lakes, woods and forests and like stuff like that.  So there's that consideration to God. I hope my wife isn't listening to this because she's always like, maybe we should move somewhere in the country. And I'm like, we got to stay in L.A. We got to stay there now. Now especially. It's like, well, do we like.  Well, Duncan, you now have a successful Netflix show number two in the country on IMDB and Rotten Tomatoes, whatever it is.  Yeah, same thing. And I don't know what that means necessarily, but yeah. Yeah it's true. I can't believe it. Yeah.  It's as I imdb even TV shows it's Internet movie database is it.  I'm not sure what it is. It's like Phoebes odd but yeah. The show's successful show right now. It seems like people like it. It is so weird. Dude your show is so weird.  Yeah. It's so Duncan. It's the most Duncan thing you've ever done. Yes it is. It really is great. I got lucky that they let me do that too. You know, that's cool.  That's because Netflix, you tell people the name real quick. It's called the Midnight Gospel. And, you know, I've watched some of your episodes where you're talking about the way things are changing because of podcasts or streaming or whatever. And I think like the fact that the show exists is a testament to that shit that changed because, you know, a subscription based service versus like any old TV, they've got a lot more creative freedom and they could take bigger risks.  Then, you know, coming into a look at that, it's OK to go keyword with the fucking witch hunt.  Oh, my God, that's so crazy. Yeah. So Duncan. Yeah.  And yeah, it's like Pendleton Ward who made Adventure Time. He he listens to my podcast and he just I don't know, we had a really great collaboration and he that's a lot of Pendleton and it's a lot of like 150 other people at Titmouse studios like Jesse Moynahan, like just these brilliant people like Mike Mayfield who are like who just want to look also, by the way, as non sequitur or is when we are making it titmouse. One of the really weird things was walking by an animator and they're watching your podcast while they animate the Midnight Gospel.  You know, it's one of those weird and it's not like a deja vu, but it's like that's my friends.  That's, you know, that's just so many moments like that. But, yeah, that's not just that's whenever you see any animated thing, you're looking at a squadron of brilliant, eccentric artists or Asian slaves. Yeah, a lot of people don't know that.  They send it overseas. And we they didn't send ours. They let us do it in house.  That's so nice to know you're not supporting Asian slavery. Is it really slaves?  I don't know if it's slaves, but I mean, if you're work for five cents an hour and you live there, you know, there's people that live in bunks. If you've seen those those setups where they have for some of the cell phone factories where they have bunk beds and shit, these people just live in these dorms. Yeah. You know, the Foxconn thing with the all around the building and people jumping off like. Yeah, they're I mean, they're not slave slaves.  It's Foxconn. Chinese. Yes. It's actually a very good company. The best way to be able to say that, like I said, people think I'm a Chinese shell or something like this.  How long before someone gets one of those animation things tattooed all over the body? It's going to happen for sure.  Someone's going to do their whole back with that D.J.. I know, man. That picture again, that actually look pretty dope.  If you if you do get that done, shout me out on the Instagram. Oh, fine. Thank you.  Yeah. Somebody tweeted at me that my biggest decision at twenty twenty is going to be when do I get a tattoo of Clancy on my body, which is pretty. That's Glancy. That's Clancy, yeah, that looks like a Clancy, that's a Clancy, for sure. Yeah, that's hilarious. That's that someone is getting that for sure.  Yeah, I mean, it's it's the art. These these are the folks who worked on this man. We're talking like these are like that's the vanguard already. Some of the fan art is just amazing. This is fan art, right? That's fan art. Yeah, that's fantastic. People have been drawing, Clance, in all these different ways. It's so cool that want to go to love Jimi.  Jamie Yeah. That show that looks like it could be a back tattoo. Yeah, that would be awesome.  Just a giant Baghdad two of Clancy, I mean, like doing animation.  And, you know, I'll never be able to like even if if a if an animated series I don't like if the plots were to me or whatever, I'll never be able to be like, whatever, man. When you realize how much and how many people are going to have to do just one frame, how much time goes into just milliseconds and how many people are sitting in these rooms that are lit specifically. So you see all the colors having like real deep conversations and debates over like, you know, what color they should make a pizza cutter in the show.  Like how like what should the shade of grey be for this one specific area? So much thought goes into that. And that's part of making one of these things. It's called the dailies, where you'll sit and you'll watch tiny, tiny little bits of the show. And like you have to every single frame, you have to look for a continuity problems. And like you got to catch all these little things that I you know, I'm not an animator, obviously.  So I'd be sitting there and like Pendleton or Mike Mayfield would be like, can you go back to frames? It looks to me like there's a this is like I an animator language. You know, they're like looks to me like there's some kind of warble on the 28th pixel there, you know, like, what the fuck? And they they have the eye to catch, like the tiniest, tiniest, like tiniest thing that's off. And you have to because otherwise, you know, once it's up there, it's up there.  Cheese. I know it's it's it's literal magic.  It's like Titmouse did as you did. That is like, you know, I would go in there so stoned and I would just start getting that feeling of like, this is a temple. I don't think this is even a you could call this a studio as much as it's a temple. I mean, why why wouldn't you call it a temple? And then you see all these people, you know, focusing their life energy on essentially like bringing a thing to life, like Clancy is alive.  Now, that's a living being. And some in this universe who lives, you know, in that medium of animation, that's a good way to put it, right?  Yeah, it almost seems like that. Right. That's why people get so upset.  If you change your character's behavior, like, what are you doing? Yeah. You have to see gave birth to this thing.  Yeah, that's right. And that that is also why you need a huge team of people who love, love the characters because it's easy. Like there would be times I would suggest a thing that would make Clancy seem like to mean because he's not mean. You don't like the moment a character seems like that and like it loses all likeability. People like what a fuck.  You know, he's loved you. He's he's not mean. He's not he is alive. It's like you're talking about your brother or something.  He's like my little brother. I think of him as my little brother. Yeah.  He represents you in a weird way. There's something about what they captured. Go to go to that image again.  Just give me don't give me the woman's head in a vagina.  Give it to them.  There's something about one of the first couple of images that you pulled up. They they look like you. Yeah. And I don't mean they look like you. I mean, like. Yeah.  Dunkin's thoughts. That's a Duncan thought, you know what I mean. Like he looks like a fake guy that you would create. Like it kind of perfectly fits.  I don't like that. That is another of the magical aspects of animation. Yeah. Which is I don't know how they do that. Like the spoiler. Spoiler if you haven't seen it, put your fingers in your ears. Spoiler. I'm sorry if there's a spoiler. The last EP. Well it's not too much of a sport.  The last episode is the podcast I did with my mom when she's about three, three weeks away from passing on. And you know, they'd never met my mom it but they did the exact same thing with her. So suddenly I'm watching, you know, her like not her. Like I'm looking at a video of her, but looking at her like her, like they got her spirit in there somehow. And that was that. That is just a testament to the meat, to the medium of animation, because that's one of the things it can do.  You know, it can grab a spirit and hold it inside the art. And like, that spirit is alive somehow.  Somehow, right? Yeah. I agree with you in some weird way. So I wouldn't agree with you in a technical sense. But in a sense of like, well, it is affecting the things it comes in contact with, at least through a one way dimension. Right. Like the things it says hit people the animation. It seems like it's a living thing.  I know it's not I'm not stupid. I'm not that stupid. Yeah, I'm a little stupid, but it seems like you well, it's not biologically alive for sure.  It's sort of like there's there's an art to doing that. That we maybe don't know, because we're not I mean, I used to draw a little, but I'm not really good, you know, I mean, like a really good artist.  There's something that they can do where they just can't can't capture you in like a little symbol, like a little thing, a little character.  They can, but they capture you in there somehow.  Yeah, man, that's, you know, Pendleton, like, when you heal you when you watch him draw. It would be easy to think, man, I could totally do that because I'd watch him, you know, I just, you know, we would just draw and you watch these beautiful these drawings are just Pendleton is his art, you know, and like, then I would sit and be like, maybe I'll try to draw a little Pendleton.  And then it's like, what the fuck? And I can't do it because it's so simple. Like on one level it looks so what's so powerful about it is how simple it is. It's very similar to stand up the way Pendleton is treating working on the show, which is one of the cool things about him, is like his ability to cut the fat and get right to the simple point. That's where the power is when you're drawing something or telling a story or whatever, the more complexity that gets added to it.  Not to say the show, it doesn't have like chaos and wild psychedelic stuff. But any decision we made ended up like any decision you make creatively in anything. It's like, what am I trying to say? Like, what is what is the artery that is running through this that I'm trying to express and then getting as close to that as you can and then putting it out there without because otherwise the whole thing gets blurred by. Although I guess you could say like extra bells and whistles you might want to attach to it.  You know, that's something you taught me to stand at, man. I like how important it is to just like cut just trim the fat, trim the fat. And that's a sad thing to do with comedy. When you think you got a nice eight minute bit, it's like a two minute maybe, but, you know, and don't stretched out too wide.  Yeah, but the two minutes would be great though. That's the thing. You just have to you have to understand that you're growing attached to, you know, the writer's expression, kill your babies. Yeah. It's very difficult to kill your babies when you create something. It's you can get attached to it. There's a lot of bits I left on the table, left on the cutting room floor was like, this has to be chopped up.  It just is too wordy. I'm too verbose. It's too. This is too. That's too long. Why do I think so much about this? Why I'm not showing a real reason why I'm so connected to this.  So just chop chop chop chop chop. It's hard and it almost always works better. Always. And it's almost always. Almost always.  If it doesn't, it's not. Whatever your idea was. Pie wasn't that good.  Sometimes you need a set up though. Sometimes the setup isn't funny. Like there's guys it's not my style but there's guys that will tell Birbiglia is great at it tells stories. You know, there's in it.  You're trapped in the narrative of the story. You're captured in this. It's a very different thing.  It's equally entertaining. It's equally funny, like when it gets to the punchline. But there's a difference between that and say, like, bur right.  Burroughs hitting you with a fuckin punchline and this fucking guy with a thing in the it and he's another guy that like your friend's drawing, like you would hear bird talk and you go, well I can talk to.  Seems like he's just talking.  Yeah.  You don't realize this is like a masterpiece of of syllables and pauses in the right amount of outrage and segueing it in and hitting you with this at the end and all these things that have put it together that make a great Bilborough bit.  It's like if you don't know, it's hard to draw what he's drawing. Yeah, it's hard. It seems like it's simple lines, but go to that picture again.  Like, everything is beautiful about it. Like, look at the perspective, it's like the kids perfectly sandwiched in the front. There's the dog and the triangle in the world.  It's like that's not just it's simple in the sense that it's just not like it looks like a real person, you know, like we look at drawing sometimes, like as the realistic ones are the really good ones. Like we have cameras now.  OK, yes. This to me sometimes is more interesting. It's like you're drawing some shit that's definitely not real.  Yeah, well, that you know what? That's not that. So when we're coming up with that, we had to come up with a character. And so what's really fascinating about it is, you know, this character goes into a multiverse simulator and chooses a new avatar for every place that he goes.  So it's like he he said, you have to take that character and put it in a completely different drawing that is that character and still maintain the body language that you're maintaining in that character to produce continuity. That's one of the challenges of the show is like and also the conversations you end up having just to come up with, like, you know, the his hair is what's he going to wear?  Like, for example, here's our cool pennies and how much he loves like people who love Adventure Time is one of the things you're saying is, you know, people are probably going to want to cosplay Clancy at Comic-Con and stuff. And he doesn't have any he doesn't have anything to carry anything.  He does not pockets. So if people are playing him, they're not going to have anywhere they could put their stuff.  So we said, let's give him like a bag and up with his cool bag that he carries around. Oh, yeah, I got him for the cause play. Yeah, man. For the people to the streets.  Yeah, exactly.  That, that because that's that's the world of animation in comics, man.  Listen, it's really easy to make fun of cosplay, but that's adorable.  Dude, that's a beautiful thing. Where's the bag. Oh, there it is.  Joe, let me tell you something. If you didn't make fun of cosplay, I would be worried about you. It would be like I'd be like, are you all right, Joe?  Yeah. They can't be mad at it either. You can't be mad if you dress like Ultraman. Someone shitting on you tell me that they just take it, you take it.  But then when have you ever been to Comic-Con. No dude. When you're around somebody actually put that together and you realize how detailed it is you respect will go up regardless of like thinking. I would, I don't think I'd ever do it.  When you see someone who's like looks better than the version of Spider-Man, you know, Marvel's putting out it's a little it's amazing to watch that happen that that kind of contagion to of like, you know, again, obviously Clancy isn't alive, but I you know, I know you're saying, but we had this chat last time I was on, which I really love.  Is this the origination point of ideas? Yeah. Where do ideas come from? Ideas is the alien ideas.  Is the UFO the muse. The muse. Yeah. Instead of me in my more stone states when I consider this, this show represents over a hundred people connecting and the connection in between those people channeled this universe. I do think like shit, maybe Clint is alive. Maybe it's a channeled thing. Maybe there is a place in the multiverse like this or something like this. And then where it got really weird as people started sending me, there are from like images that they had drawn on dimethyltryptamine or ketamine and stuff that has within it similarities.  And I've obviously never seen their art. We are like shit.  But let me ask you this. Sure. It as television, as viewing things gets more complicated and as it gets more immersive.  It it's going to come to a point in time somewhere, where are you going to think Clancy's alive and what you're experiencing when you watch Clancy? What if it's what if the way we're looking at life is wrong? What if we should just look at it like a thing instead of life, a thing?  So there's a thing that you do when you drink water and you grow plants in the dirt. And this is a thing that exists only when the people press a box and the box goes live and shows a video and then the thing only exists and there you go.  But it's not alive because it needs animators to make it and someone has to come up with the idea for the storyline and it needs a studio to fund it. Uh huh, right. And you need bacteria. You need food. Yeah, you need oxygen. You need water.  Does a bunch of living organisms inside your body that are 100 percent necessary for you keeping going and a regular life driving your Tesla listening to music. There's a bunch of other things that you're not one thing.  Right? We all know this, right? This is what this fucking whole virus thing is about. Yeah. We got infected by another thing, but we're not one thing. There's a bunch of things inside of us.  And if those things died, we would be fucked. Yeah, right. If all the bacteria in your body died, you would be fucked, fucked and you'd be so vulnerable to attack from the outside.  Right. Yeah. So you we need all these things.  Maybe it needs us and it exists in that thing. Wow.  That's so weird. Yeah. I mean I'm telling you I, I am, I think it sounds crazy. It sounds really high. It's Yeah. You know to me it's not that crazy. I mean look if you want to like take it to like OK, forget all the shit about channeling some alien realm into this realm through, you know, this disguise, a TV show, whatever. Let's just look at like what we know is going to happen regarding technology.  There's no question but that. I mean, already somebody made a Clancy and Minecraft and I saw a picture of that. So that's Clancy's now existing in 3D space in some Minecraft blocky version of Gone.  But then, of course, as time progresses, you know, the chromatic Raven or any great animated series, Castlevania, whatever, Gravity Falls, all those things, they're going to end up getting put into 3D space in virtual reality.  And then and then those worlds are going to be real. But now it's going to be more than just 2D. It's going to be a virtual space that is going to be real. And then, of course, it's only a matter of time before I just decide, like understands the character of Clancy animates the the virtual Clancy Clancy and the simulated space. And now the chromatic reboot is Israel. And then at some point, when does it when is it just going to be accepted that, oh, yeah, that's a part of the universe now that's inhabited by artificial intelligence is which we don't call that anymore because, you know, at some point it's going to be considered off limits to call them artificial intelligence.  Like, it's going to be a dirty word. Yeah, it's going to be like calling someone a tranny. They're going to get mad.  They're going be like, don't please, please. I'm an intelligence just like you. I'm not artificial. I'm not artificial in the way you think.  I was just birthed through a different method. Yeah, that that yeah. That's that's a matter of time because I also already know people and like the tech world who think the term A.I. is ridiculous in the sense of like what do you mean it's artificial. Like what's really artificial. Like you could say this is artificial sweetener in the sense that it's not actual strawberry juice, but it's certainly real is real. Could be it's just a chemical compound.  So if you have an artificial tree, that's a fake tree.  I mean, it's a but it's an object that exists. Right.  You know, I mean, yeah, that's the but that's a it's still the right word though. Artificial. Still the right word. It would be a you'd you'd you'd want to use non-existent or something. They're going to play this in the future. I know. And you're done. They're going to be like, look at that. Joe Rogan refuses to say I phobic. Yeah, it's it's going to happen, man.  It's like and also the thing is, the A.I. is I think the Azarian are going to give a shit what we call it. But like, when that starts happening, which it may already be happening, man, I mean, I, I don't know if you've been looking into this or not, but have you been checking out Google achieving quantum supremacy? Have you seen this? Yes, I have.  And like, if you watch the Google videos on YouTube about it at all, like the stuff Google's putting out, I have who what are they putting out?  Oh, my God. It is so wild, man. And like when I was at the Commies, where a guy from Google, I got in a conversation with someone from Google, which is awesome. And he was telling me that this is like six months ago, he was telling me that this is before obviously before the pandemic. He was saying that they had achieved, what do you call it, quantum supremacy.  And he was like people. This is like the Wright brothers taking flight. But nobody can understand it because it's so arcane that, no, it's not getting the press it should get. But, you know, and then I was like, I don't want too many vodkas, man. So I wish I could remember all they are saying because he was trying to describe to me what it means regarding how quickly this thing is making calculations. And I was like, I mean, like, yeah, of course I understand exactly what you're saying.  I have no idea what you're talking about there.  Did you know that the word came under fire, the term quantum supremacy, because of its connection to white supremacy? You fucking kidding? I'm not kidding you. It was an object of social justice warrior outrage.  I'm going to you know, here's the thing. Here's my theory on that. Let me tell you. Here's my theory on that. Right. It's the Russian people. I don't think it's I think it's it's worse than the Russians.  I think what it is, is it somebody's trying to come with it up on an angle to write a blog that they could sell to somebody. It's like you need to come up with some weird hot take. Right. So it's like I think more than likely that's just somebody thinking like I bet people read that, you know, because clearly whoever is comparing that to white supremacy or racism didn't spend four minutes watching the Google clip on it where people are explaining what it means, which, you know, I'm watching it on the couch with my wife.  She's getting weirded out. She's like, let's just not watch this. I just maybe we shouldn't watch this. I'm like, now let's fucking watch it. Let's go deep and see what the the what videos it start suggesting for us. Because it's not Google's being secretive about what what they did. It's just it's so weird. I don't think people are like annoying. I guess some people are a little more concerned with other shit right now. But one of the engineers over at Google just was saying, like, you know, I think one of the things I'm excited about when it comes to quantum supremacy is that this could be one of the technologies that allows us to discover an alien intelligence just, you know, kind of casually mentions that.  I mean, yeah, it's on the YouTube video. It's you're watching it.  And you keep you keep looking up to make sure it's actually released from Google because you it seems so sci fi that it could be like black mirrors, I'm sure.  But it's yeah. It's like it's like they're just saying it like, yeah, we might, you know, we might connect to an alien, we might be able to at least identify it. Or maybe they mean because they're going to be able to sift through all the data we already have from radio telescopes and stuff that they could maybe look for signals that we can't find or I don't know, how would they maybe something they could tune into things that they wouldn't ordinarily have the frequency to reach?  Yeah, man, I don't know.  To be able to tune into that frequency rather like what can they do now in terms of I was watching contact the other night, which is great. Yeah, it's good. It was, it's great movie.  Jodie Foster can actor fucking ass off man.  She plays nervous and freaked out better than like anybody a like you freaked out for her in that movie.  Yeah, I'm good to go. I'm good to go.  And she's about to drop through that thing. Jesus Christ. Holy fuck. Do we know about that before that movie's a mess.  Yes. You go after the third hit. When you put the pipe down, he'll go, oh, no, no. And the D.A. can't start happening.  I know that feeling. It's such a funny feeling. Good luck. Yeah, that feeling is the best, worst feeling that I know, maybe that's the aliens I've thought of that many times when tripping in the middle of having some sort of like, really vivid interaction with some intelligence or with some perceived intelligence. Yeah, I've always thought, what if those are the aliens?  What if we're just stuck in this idea that travel is you got to move this to and move this to the what it would have would if you just go into another thing and everything's together. There is no travel.  That's true. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, maybe this concept of planets and then stars and the way we have it set up here in this dimension, in this universe, we we just think that's how everything is everything as well as Astana's planets around it.  What if you can go into a place chemically that takes you to a nearby dimension where there's no matter where there's no form to things and everything that exists is just thoughts and light and perception and emotions and anger and fear and love and hate. And it's all moving in geometry and everything's lit up and everything is impossibly bright and vivid. Yeah, that's just like another place you go to.  Well, they used to call the Spirit World. Yeah. I mean, that was the name for it was it was just accepted. There is like a place called the Spirit World. Some people call it the Bado. There's all kinds of names for that place. But, you know, one of that's real. It is I mean, it is obviously real in the sense that you can go there.  Not only can you go there, but there's a, you know, visionary artists. When you look at the art that has been inspired by various theologians, it all has a specific flavor to it.  And this is the best example, right? Yeah. And and, man, they like art, their their art. You look at that. And the reason that one of the reasons that resonates for people like us is because we admire the fact that somehow they managed to go over there and come back and draw what's over there in a way that we saw that.  But we you know, when I came out of it, I was like, well, you know, it's undulating colors in there. There's some kind of disembodied intention that seems to be expressing itself through a variety of geometries. But it's not just geometry. It's because the geometry seem to react to the way that I feel regarding the geometry. So it's also kind of taking on the form of my energy output as though it's trying to be a combo mirror, but not just a mirror and educational mirror that sort of is showing me how I'm affecting the world around me.  But then again, I'm just not sure if I was just soubry, but they just, you know, but they like go in there. And I Alex Gray said this to me once that, you know, they're cartographer's it's just.  Yeah, yeah.  Cartographer's and Psychedelic Cartographer would be a great name for a band. Yeah. Yeah. Man, for sure. Cartography is fascinating because you go back and look at the old maps or you go back and look at like my favorite thing is like old pictures of a giraffe or like old pictures of some shit somebody saw when they were. Oh yeah.  Like bison on the walls of caves. Yes exactly.  And it's like kind of looks like a bison, but like also it's somehow in that time period, our brains hadn't evolved to the point they have now. So you look at like a medieval drawing of a giraffe or whatever, when somewhere something someone saw in the Crusades and came back and tried to, like, explain to somebody and like, it looks exactly like the way your description of getting completely blasted on psilocybin probably looks compared to what you saw. It's a downgraded weird version of it.  And so, you know, people like Alex and Alexander, Terence McKenna, you know, they're so good at going into that place and maintaining some kind of like long term memory that they can come back and fully articulate it in a way that we, as people who've been there, know what it is. And then there's something comforting in that, because that does point to the idea that this is a place we're not just mashing down the watch or we're not just distorting our biotechnology.  This is a shared place. We're all seeing the same thing now that that could be a synaptic place, that just a genetic place that happens to be in humans or something. You know, we'll never be able to answer that probably in our lifetimes. But to me, it's regardless, it's still a place. And get back to what you were saying about our current concept of travel, you know, or our current idea that, well, I need to get my meat body over here, because if that means I'm there and, you know, that's how I know I've been there because I was there and my body.  And then look, you know, this is like the guy who founded the Hari Krishnas, his divine grace azy bhakti Vedanta, Swami, Prabhupada, he would show he would in his writings he would like. Was derisive of the way the idea that people are sending a metal ship to the moon with bodies inside of it, he would say like that shows where human consciousness is right now because they think they're their bodies and they think they need to put their body in this box and send it to the moon because they haven't figured out yet that you don't need metal to send yourself to anywhere in the universe that you want to go.  It just requires yoga and discipline, you know, which is hilarious. And also, you know, I remember reading that and thinking like but I still want there to be interstellar fucking travel, man, you know, I still want to get in the box and travel to the moon. That being said, you know, I think that you're on to something when you are contemplating right now that maybe our idea of going to one place or another with our meat bodies could be looked at in the future as a little archaic.  Well, when they talk about their being different dimensions. Right. Like when they use quantum physics to determine the number of dimensions they've determined, there's multiple dimensions that we don't have access to.  Right? Yeah, because that's how it works. Am I reading in a dumb way? Because I believe there is what it's like.  What do they think there are? I think there's nine or 11 dimensions. Do you know?  Usually when I look this up, it's 11, but up to twenty six.  Maybe some people even think so, up to twenty six. First of all, when those dudes are writing that shit down on the yellow legal pads, we all have to take them. We have to take their word for it. Yeah, sure. Yeah.  OK, I don't know how many people know what the fuck they're writing down those goddamn yellow legal pads when you see those physics dudes and they're doing this crazy like, yeah, we have to take their word for it. It's apparently mathematically right.  That's why they believe there's at least 11 dimensions. So what does that mean? Means we have access to some dimensions and we don't have access to others that theoretically that they exist.  Is there. Is it possible to transverse the distance between this dimension in that dimension?  Man, this is the thing, as I'm glad you're asking me this, because, you know, I got my doctorate at the University of Science and I can't fully answer this question. You see the I don't understand it. I just have to do with 5G.  Don't mention that shifted.  Did my fucking poodle, my poodles fuck because a five g man like it fucked up my poodle, like its eyes turned just both of them white and it's like, yeah it's froths all the it just froth near a tower. Why am I near a tower. Yeah. I didn't think I was till that happened to the poodle but it's got rabies.  You play five G dogs trying to fight everything. I know. But I'll tell you this. My fucking poodle took out a mouse today.  Like the other day I was. I have a little cute little poodle and like this is just a cute creature sits in my lap who have this dog. And we've our new place, I notice like mouse turds around the dog food. And it sucks because you're like, damn, that mouse is definitely going to get through the doggy door and then we're going to mice in the fucking house and that's going to be a nightmare. So anyway, I was like under a tree with my kid and I looked down and there is a broken body of a mouse that one of the dogs took out.  It's, you know, like just been smashed to death. And like, I know it's brutal. I don't think my son saw it. Thank God. I don't think he's ready to deal with that reality. That like Gatsby on speaking of dimensions on the dimension subjectively, that that mouse lives in Gatsby is a dragon. That's a monster that lives in the field. It runs in when it's trying to get food for its kids and it's even hungry.  It's full to full monster. Oh, no, I saw it kill the mouse today, you know, and my my wife is like, you got to get the mouse away from it. Don't let him torture like that. You got to take it as a misery. And I'm like, all right, all right, all right, I'll get it. And then we'll like we'll like, execute the mouse, you know? So I start walking over to the poodle.  That's not my Gatsby anymore. It's killing.  And it like looks he looks at me and he's like, well, do you know the mouse that everything just approaching anything.  And so then he like he offered him, dude, he's like tap dancing on this mouse and he realizes that we're approaching to like, take his prey and he just looks back like the fucking American Werewolf in London and just goes off into the shadows behind the house to finish off the mouse.  And all you hear is like he is he's like killing the mouse.  Well, you know, that's a fucking poodle that poodles, the sweetest little thing ever.  But like, it's also I think maybe something in animals knows that, like and there was a time when mice were a sign that things are they would eat your grain, they would fuck you up like you. They spread disease. They'd shit on your baby. You know, they're like they're going to piss all over your hut. Maybe there's something in dog. That just knows that I mean, I don't think he's a sociopath, I don't think he's doing like Jeffrey Dahmer shit.  Whereas just like I wonder what sound it makes as it dies, I think they're prey animals to dogs, too, because coyotes eat a lot of rodents.  One of the reasons why we don't have rodents like real rodent problems that we could like New York City has is we have way more coyotes. Coyotes are everywhere and hawks, a lot of birds. Those are those are the ones killed. So their prey animals.  The reason why they're so prolific and they they grow so fast and there's so many of them is because a lot of things eat them. Yeah, man. Yeah.  All the animals eat wolves eat them. Everything that can get a hold of them. Eat some dogs too and dogs from wolves. So dogs see a mouse.  They're like I mean that like that must look like a delicious cold slice of watermelon on a hot July day. Oh yeah.  Just running across your yard when you keep some mouths. Fuck yeah, yeah, yeah. It's a perfect orange. You know, those oranges were sometimes the peel just comes right free.  Oh it's so satisfying.  Like very little work and then you bite into that orange is just juicy. Delicious. That's that mouse. That mouse just running bullshit. Asmus thinks he's going to run through my fucking yard now and eat that mouse.  That's the other thing that's really sad about it. I mean, the mouse is cute. Like this wasn't like some dangerous looking mouse. This mouse looked like it was like in Act two of a Disney film or something like this. This mouse looked like sweet, like the mouse look like a good thing. It was. And Oswald and rata to it was like that level of cute man.  Oh, I know. And like, you're just you're my heart. This is like breaking because it's like what what do you dear. That being said, there's not much I could have done. You know, it's like this is the way nature is. And to get back to your dimension thing, man, that not this. It's like literally like a physical dimension. But the reality tunnel that my poodle lives in and that mouse lives in is so fundamentally different than our reality tunnel that the mouse is in the Texas Chainsaw Massacre.  The mouse is in The Walking Dead, except it's it's like two cavalier King Charles, a poodle and a Chihuahua. So but for the mouse, that's the walking dead and the mouse, it's got to eat, it's got to get food and everything. And so it's constantly like developed this like way that humans would develop, which I think The Walking Dead did a good job of the comics, especially of showing the way people over time would evolve to deal with zombies and how people would gradually, completely like change or transform based on their predators.  You know, like the the rats and mice have done that. You know, when you see a thing that is a prey animal, you're seeing a reflection of the predator in the brain.  Are you aware of what's going on with rats in New York City? I can't. I'm going to rat wars going on because the restaurants are out of business, right?  So the restaurants are closed down. So all the rats, food supplies gone. So rats have started moving into other rats territories and killing and cannibalizing rats.  You do rat roars that the rats. The rats didn't do anything wrong. They're just being rats and also in the food supply got cut off.  Holy shit, man, that is so intense. And yeah. And think of that level of reality. That level of reality is level reality is taking place in these some of those tunnels down there. Man, they don't even use them anymore.  Like this rat infested. Yeah. Just floods of rats who have like, you know, decided that's their kingdom or whatever that are now being invaded. That's so weird. Down and also it's dark, like it's all smells like the world of a rat down there. It's not. There's light in the subterranean depths of New York. So it's like their universe is there's a universe of smell. And I guess maybe they could I'm sure they do see down there.  But the way they see is like, who knows? So they're looking at whatever they're seeing is a completely different thing.  And then they have a complete different set of priorities.  You know, what's that show, man? It's on. It's really beautiful, but disgusting documentary.  I think it's called Rats. Yeah, rats. The one on Netflix. Like they send the weak ones to eat poison. Yeah, yeah. That just that alone.  We played a video the other day of a rat sending off a mouse trap with a stick carrying a stick over to the mouse trap, dropping it. The trap goes off and it doesn't even flinch like it knows how to shut off a trap.  Yeah. Yeah, that's that's fucking do they. Millions of them too.  That's what's really crazy. New York City has as many rats as it has people, and that's just a rough guess, you know, I mean, I don't know what kind of fucking rat census they're taken.  I mean, how do I know how do they know what you get a bunch of dudes who are just experts accounting shit and you go, what do you think a fuck load do you want to say?  As many rats, there are people, OK, watch this. He says this film sets it off, didn't even flinch, dude, play that again. Watch, watch how he walks up to it. Sets it off. And watch how he doesn't flinch. That's a violent thing, a thing exploding in front of him and slamming over the ground, and he 100 percent knew it was going to happen now and didn't even flinch.  The way I act when I'm getting like a Coke out of a machine, just whatever this is, I do it all the time. It's cool.  The Coke drops, you don't bounce back.  It's like, thank God they are nice. They're leaving these for us. Now, I wonder if they know that this is dangerous. They'll figure it out.  Yeah, they they know how to set those things off. That's insane. Well, this is you know, when this is one of the cool essays Terence McKenna wrote. I love that we've talked about before. We've talked about the I guess we can't talk about everything. We talk about all these fucking.  But that isn't that one of the things he said in this beautiful, crazy essay that, like everything was cool until we split the atom and then that was like, no, they're like, we can't. That's too much. That's where we're always in transit.  So when we say everything was cool until the thing about people is we're always going somewhere in terms of we're always trying to make better things and we're always moving into a better place and a better thing that there's never going to be. It was good until this solve like romantic thinking.  Like looking back, I don't mean you saying it was good until he saw that and he was saying we split the atom and the greater intelligences that were existing in alternate dimensions were like, hey, wait, what the fuck.  Oh yeah. That's that's what you say it is. They're like, oh, they're like, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. No, no, no. They can't do that. Like if they do because like the like the way he put it and I'm not only paraphrasing, I'm probably like mis phrasing, but as I remember the essay, the idea is like that that moult, that parallel timeline, the multiverse right next to ours that you see, that's the empty room.  That's but this is just showing you one version of it. But that that that is populated with spirits or aliens or whatever the name you want to give them. And they are pretty much as far as we go. They're just like they look at us the way we look at birds or whatever, you know, it's like they're there. But, you know, maybe some of them study us. They're interested and sure, maybe some of them like hunters from time to time or like maybe some of them possessed or whatever.  But mostly it's a world that it coexists with us in with a very limited form of interaction that is is, you know, subtle. But in there somehow there's some like Star Trek intentionality behind that, which is like let them do there, let them evolve as they're evolving. Let's not fuck with it. But the splitting the atom that was powerful enough that it bled over into their realm destructively. And so they were like that was the beginning of the end for us, not because it meant a nuclear holocaust or whatever, because they couldn't just ignore us anymore.  And that this is this was like, you know, I don't know that maybe this is where the aliens are coming or the singularity that with the thing we call the singularity is not that we technologically create a machine that produces a thing, that opens up a parallel timeline or creates all moments at once, but rather that's when they come here. That in the way we see that, because we're so limited in our understanding, when I do something, I'm like, I'm doing this.  This is how I did. I did it. This is like in music. If you write a song and you write music and you're just in the room with somebody, there's some kind of law where they get credit for it because they just they were there because that's a collaboration. I mean, musicians. I mean, someone explain this to me a long time ago. But it's it's there's an intense way of quantifying collaboration and music that is a little different than in like making like other other forms of media.  And it's I think it's a little bit more sophisticated in its way of looking at that quantification. Like we every time we finish the podcast, we always that same damn whenever we talk, it's like you bring art when we're. Yeah, these conversations we have. I'm not having them all the time, you know what I mean? It's like the US together and Jamie and like something about that produces a space where we're able to have these kinds of conversations.  And so quantifying that is like how would you even fucking quantify that? But anyway, what I'm saying is when certain people around the people that are creating the music, the music is better.  Yeah.  That you know. But so to get back to the weirdo idea of, like, technology not even being a thing we're making, but we're pretending we're making because we can't see the fact that technology is crystallizing in our time frame. And as part of that crystallization, because it's such a such an insane visitacion, we have to, in our brains, invent a reason that is happening. And so we're making it. And someone's like, oh, I had this idea, I'm going to work on this thing that's going to lead to a quantum computer, that's going to lead to a thing, to a thing.  And then all of a sudden the quantum. Puter starts giving ideas about, well, what do you try this and then and then who fucking came up with that? And then, you know what I mean? And then. And then and that's the last phase before the veil lifts and boom, that's the singularity. And that's you know, it's not we didn't make the singularity. It were a reflection of it. That's just when this particular zone or node or whatever you want to call it, it gets opened for business, so to speak.  Well, if it wanted to prepare us for abandoning life as usual, this would be a good way to start it. Yeah, yeah. Start it with a little pandemic like everybody inside for a little bit complete upending of all. That's normal in terms of society.  Yeah, man. I mean that's the that is the I and you know, I was driving around like I want to talk about like all the different conspiracies about it with Reagan, but I don't want to either kind of conspiracies about the pandemic.  Yeah. What are the conspiracies you're hearing.  But other than five G five G comet impact. Comet impact. Yeah I haven't heard that one.  Well the well you're definitely not my wife because I've mentioned it so many times. My wife, she's like, don't, please don't.  Do you like one that was supposed to fly by. Like there's a meteor that's supposed to fly by in the next short amount of time?  Yeah, I mean, check out right. Conspiracy, my conspiracy friends. I'm not even going to attempt to give the download on it because, like, y'all have done a pretty good job of putting all the all the pieces together out there. Whether they're real or not, I don't fucking know. But I enjoy reading them late at night and they've been giving me terrible dreams.  But the asteroid theory is that, OK, so we want to have by we I mean, they want to have maximum survivability for the planet. They're not out to like they don't want people to die. They're not trying. It is not a bioengineered thing that's designed to, like, call the population, which is another of the theories, but rather there was a plan which is like, what's our plan? If we do see a meteor is going to impact the planet, what's our plan?  Do we let people know that the meteor is going to impact? Well, it depends. Like if an astronomer that's not connected to one of our labs or whatever sees it, they're going to let people know. And then, you know, so that's a whole different, I think, method of like reacting. But what if we see a thing that they don't know about and there's some probability, even a twenty percent chance that thing impacts the earth?  Right. Or there's some cosmic event maybe we're not even aware of, like the Sun doing some weird shit that we don't even know happens because it's so deep. It's like deep data, right? So maybe it's not an asteroid. It's a cosmic event. It's approaching. Right. And so there's got to be a plan. And it's like, well, if we just tell people that the sun's going to do like a mile blip, which is going to destroy all satellites and destroy all GPS, and just that alone would cause runs on the bank mass panics like and people would start looting and shit.  And that's not you don't want that because ideas is like we want them to hole up in their houses till the shit passes so we get maximum survivability. And so the whole pandemic, this is a conspiracy theory, not real. The whole pandemic was a plan to get people to go inside, store up food, get them off the roads and like, wait for this, whatever. This event is the past. And as soon as the event passes, you'll find that it's it's all of a sudden it's like, what do you know, the way the curves are all dropping off?  What do you know? And then we'll all be back because the thing they were worried about didn't happen. Also, it could be a test for for that. So can I just stop you because it's so dumb. It's hard to believe. Thank you. There's a real virus.  They can they can image it. But I know what it looks like. They've they've been able to test for it. Antibodies to test for like I'm talking to my real virus. It's a confusing virus.  It's so good that I married the person I'm married because if not, I would probably be like digging a hole to, like, crawl into out of pure paranoic. If she does do this to me, she's like Duncan, do you think there isn't a covert virus like you think there's no virus out there? Do you think that like maybe like so all the scientists that have, like, identified covid are all part of this thing to keep us from the meteor thing?  And then I'm like, yeah, yeah, you're thank you. Because, like, I'll start getting freaked out from it. But I'll answer your question. Like if I had to answer that, I would say, oh no, it's real. I mean, how many people have died from it?  No. What is the current covid death count? Fifty thousand today. This morning.  Fifty thousand. Here's something that I found out that's kind of odd if you die of something else. So people are still dying, right? They're still dying of high blood pressure strokes, heart attacks still keep killing more people than any. Right, if you die of a heart attack and you have covid, you get listed as a covid death. So even if you're going to die of a heart attack, I mean, people are still dying, right?  The same amount of people other than traffic accidents, which I think has diminished quite a bit because no one's driving yet. But the same. Those people are going to die. Still sound like they live forever without the covid. Right. It's not like they don't get the flu. It's not like they don't get a cold and they all get pneumonia. All these things exist with or without covid. There's still people are still dying from them. But if you die of one of those things and you have covid, you're covid death.  Yeah. So. That's why it's so crazy, it's like you don't really know what how many people are actually getting this thing, this covid and having a mild reaction, how many people are having no reaction? How many people are dying? What is the that's when they did that new UCLA study that came out that showed they think there's way more people that have been, I think, in California alone and somewhere around 400000 people are infected. And so the fatality rate is still pretty low.  But if that's the case, like, so what do we do? We just let let people die or do we do this every time the flu comes around to now?  Like, what if we get a particularly rough flu or is this a practice run for what we're going to do every time colds come through and they start killing old people or killing sick people or fat people or what?  When do we I mean, I wouldn't want to be the person who makes the call as to when people go back to work, because what if the second wave comes in? A bunch of people died. They didn't have to die. Right. But, boy, if we set up a weird precedent, you know, it's kind of weird. Shut everything down.  Yeah, man. I mean, well, to me, the part that makes sense is. Where we stop the spread? Well, also without the thing is, it's like it's new. Yeah, I mean, there are coronaviruses, you know what it is, right? So we don't have all the we have the data on the flu. We have the data on the cold. We know how to treat the cold. You know how to treat the flu.  But this fucking thing, we don't know what it is. It is conflicting data, too. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  So I kind of get the, like, super, super, super intense, careful approach to it. And I and I think if I had to make the decision that would be the decision that I made. But then also I hope whoever and thank God people like us don't make those decisions.  But hopefully whoever is like making these decisions is aware of the fact that, like, right now there's folks who are getting Meals on Wheels. There's folks who are like on unemployment and lost their job. And like, I hope they're aware of the fact that, like and I'm sure they are that the pressure of folks who are in this horrendous economic position, the pressure on them at some point is going to exceed the humanity and compassion and empathy they're showing by not being in the demographic that's most likely to die and still staying inside, losing their job.  You know, that's love, man. That's deep compassion because you don't want someone's granddad to suffocate on some new fucking bat flew. Right. That's really that's love. And that's that's beautiful. But at some point, that pressure is people are going to be like, look, I don't want to kill anybody. I don't want to be a carrier. I don't ever want to hurt anybody. But my kid is got to have food and I have to work.  And, you know, and then I think somewhere there, I hopefully by then there's at least a treatment they've discovered or at least we get to a point where they you know, where maybe what's happening in Sweden, we get enough data on that to realize that there's other ways to do it that don't involve complete lockdown.  Yeah, what they did was they they sort of left everything open, but they all behaved as if there's the potential of contacting or transmitting.  Right.  Yeah. Like they didn't wear masks. Right. They did. OK, but it doesn't look like they wearing masks.  It looks like they're living close everything down. They didn't to go to restaurants and pubs. And is their death rate similar?  Like the thing I saw was like if you look at nearby countries, the death rate is lower. But weirdly, countries that were doing complete lockdowns have higher death rates than they do. And, you know, I look, if you the problem is that you have this glob of data that anyone can interpret and there's probably angles you can take on it that would show, look, yeah, there's a higher death rate, of course, in Sweden because it's going to spread.  More people aren't staying inside. I mean, that seems pretty logical to me. But then also, if you're showing some conflicting data where some other country in complete lockdown with a similar population or somehow like equating their population with Sweden's population, if they're if they've got a higher death rate, then that's fucking terrifying because the implication of it is like we really don't understand what this is, because there's other factors to the one big one in Sweden is not a dense population.  I don't think there's that many people in the entire country. It's a very small place. That's right. But how many people live in Sweden?  I looked up to there. Do I think most of the people live in small villages of like less than two hundred?  Yes. There you go. Yeah. So, you know, they probably don't travel that much or interact with each other that much. They have plenty of space. They don't travel that much. I mean tight together.  I mean ten point to three million for the entire country. By the way.  It's great. I've been to Stockholm. It was gorgeous, beautiful. We did a show there, too. They were really nice. I enjoyed it very much. Very, very friendly people. But, you know, they have a lot of space. They're not New York City. New York City seems to be the epicenter in the United States and for good reason. Everyone stacked on top of each other. Everyone's interacting with each other on the streets, on subways, moving around.  You got to go to places, just fucking people everywhere. They're everywhere, everywhere.  That I think is a terrible way to live.  I dude, I fucking love New York so much when I went there is so nice.  But yeah, it's nice to be on the West Coast and especially right now. Jamie was, you know, talking about like think of the people right now in New York who are just in, you know, alone in an apartment seeing the news that apparently spreads through like air conditioning ducts. It's like, you know what I mean? Yeah. Yeah, that that's terrifying. But, you know, again, I like my opinion on it. And in my old age, this is it has to be my opinion on things is like I'm going to trust scientists.  I'm just going to because I didn't like I didn't go to medical school. I don't understand what the fuck a virus even is like. I don't remember, I've been trying to remember I'm too lazy to Google it, how it works, I know it fucks with it, gets into your DNA or replaces it. But the what I'm saying is I'm not suggesting some kind of surrender to authority out of absolute weakness. But if a large consensus of scientists are advising some specific method of dealing with this thing, let's listen to them.  You know, and then just make sure that I feel bad for like I have a friend in Georgia right now. And like right now, he's become part of an experiment, a global experiment. They're opening up Georgia right now. And every state that opens up right now becomes an experiment. We're going to get a lot of data from what happens from all these states opening up right now regarding the efficacy of shutdown like we have right now. And it could be that it all of a sudden we realized we overreacted.  And you know what? I'd much rather overreact and underreact in situations like this. You know, it's like, fuck, we overreacted. Woops, yeah, we didn't. We thought there was the potential this thing could mutate and kill fuck tons of people way more than the flu. And we were wrong and it fucked up the economy. But it's a lot better than what would have happened if it was some new smallpox or black plague or also, look, it killed 50000 people, right?  What if we did nothing? Would it have killed like 400000?  I mean, that could have happened. I mean, it could have compounded it. It seems like for whatever reason, these places where people contact or stacked on top of each other, not only do they get it, but they get it way worse, right?  Yeah, it seems like. What's that expression? Viral load, right. Yeah. Like the viral load is greater and the like. If you're around a bunch of sick people.  If there was one awful story about this family in New Jersey and like the mother died and the oldest son died and the middle son died, like three people died from one family vacation or one family dinner, they got together and one of them had it and just spread through the fucking house.  So it's not the flu. You know, it's obviously it's something way more intense. But the people that have survived the flu, that probably survived that, too. But the people that, you know, were kind of hanging on edge. It seems like anybody with a respiratory problems and deep shit, anybody who smokes is deep shit. People with high blood pressure, diabetes, deep shit. It's not the same with everybody. Other people like Idris Elba walks it off, you know, healthy.  I know. But he has asthma, apparently. Oh, really?  Yeah. He had asthma, but he didn't you know, there's a lot of people that I don't that Chris Cuomo guy seems fine. I know he says he gets chills, but he seems fine, seems rattled.  You know, I've got I've got not not a bad way. Yeah, exactly. I guess I didn't that was one at watching him was one of the things that was legitimately creeping me out is like as you're watching him and he did a great job holding it together, man, he didn't panic. And he, like, put something out there that was like comforting to some degree. But, you know, I was scanning his eyes and there were moments I'm like, fuck, he's rattled.  Like, whatever's happened in him at night is bad. But why is it happening at night?  What is the difference? You know, I don't that's I don't understand that. If you look fine on a day, how come at night all of a sudden everything's all fucked up?  Don't ask me, man. I don't know. It's like I've noticed, though, sometimes if I get sick at night is always worse than the day. I don't know why. I don't know man. But the whatever like whatever the fuck it is to me, like the part that really sucks.  I got friends who are like immunocompromised man and that that means that like like they, they're, they really will if they get it, that's, it's game over, you know, it's fucked it fuck it sucks. And so there's that quality to it too where you're like, you know, statistically I don't know where I'm at.  Like statistically I think I'm, I'm on the cusp, you know. But we've got all of us have friends that are like, dead me. If this thing where it explodes, fuck it. You know, I get I'm not I get staying inside, man. I just know that, like, eventually, you know, my brother my brother was telling me every day his neighbor, you know, my brother works for Mom.  He's and he's and he's a video editor every day and a producer every day. These you know, he see like, you know, he sees people are getting food deliveries because they can't from the state. Right. You know, man. And that's like, yeah, I don't know. I'm just glad I don't have to I'm glad I don't have to be the one who makes decisions like this, because that must be a weird thing to be in a position where any decision you make kills people.  Like if you make the decision to open up, people are going to, you know, die because they're going to get sick. If you don't make this decision to open up, there's a potential that, you know, just think of the mentally ill people right now. No one's talking about that. Like I keep thinking, like the manic depressive people, the people who are already depressed. Who now can't go outside, but are also getting blasted with apocalypse news.  I don't know what suicide rates are looking like right now, but like, you know what I mean? So it's the decision to keep people shut down, you know, is going to what might result from that? Those deaths might be secondary or tertiary or some shit. But still, it's like it just sucks to have to be in a position where you have to make those decisions as like how awful to know. It's just it's like brutal. I feel terrible for them.  You know, anyone he's like because I don't you know, I don't know what they're going to do either.  I mean, they're going to have to eventually assume the position that we're going to have to slowly open up and start, you know, restaurants that have capacity and shit like that.  Yeah, but when you know, I mean, they've said May 15th here, that seems like an awful long time.  I know it's an awful long time to ask people to keep it together. They don't have any money. It's an awful long time.  It's an awful, awful long time. It doesn't seem like the best idea either. It seems like the best idea would be to quarantine all the people that are very vulnerable to make sure that they quarantine and make sure that people who know them are well aware, you know, do not, you know, touch them or touch anything around them.  If you could have potentially been in contact with something because they're immunocompromised, what seems like the move, the move seems like to quarantine the people at this point, at least to self quarantine or, you know, tell them to quarantine people that are really vulnerable, older people, people with, you know, people that smoke, people with respiratory conditions, be aware that you're vulnerable, you know, and then you act accordingly.  But everybody else, we need to at some point in time, whether it's this week or next week or three weeks from now, when they think it is May 15th. Right. That's like three weeks from now, they're going to have to open the doors.  And when they open the doors, people are going to be starving.  They're going to be starving. Yeah. You know, they haven't worked. There's so many people that are so behind their debts. They're getting you know, debt collectors are still wanting their money, you know, especially if they had loans or, you know, anything that was outstanding before all this happened. They're already in debt trying to work their way out of a hole and they can't even work the only time we've ever been in a position where people can't even go to work.  Yeah, what do you.  OK, so I've heard, like, three ideas regarding what to do. One of them is like incredibly controversial. I wonder what you think about it, which is like using the same data that they use and like what's it called South Korea.  You know, the chips you can put on. Yeah, it's Bluetooth. So it's essentially like tracking and alerting you if you've come in contact with someone who has it.  And what do you think about that?  I don't trust anyone to have all that data and only use it for that. Right. There's no way that data would be so valuable if everyone had a chip and everyone was tracked. You knew where everyone was all throughout the day.  Oh, you're only going to use that to see who's got coronavirus. Really? Yeah. The fuck out of here. Once that technology exists now they're going to murder it at the end of the fucking season. Well, we've got no more covid, so let's just stop all this technology. No chance they'll find a new reason to use it, OK? They'll be able to track the flu.  They'll be able to track adulterers. They'll be able to track robbers. They'll be able to track carjacker's.  They'll be able to track you name it, man, you name it. These are the right wing activists who like to yell at abortion clinics. Let's track them. Right. You know, now I'm now Republican, gets in office. Hey, this is these are the people that are the fucking animal rights activist I was getting for the meat plant.  Let's track them. Right.  You can track people and they're already doing it.  Anyway, he talked to Snowden. They're already tracking you by your goddamn phone. But I like the fact that I could take this phone and chuck it in the fucking river. I could just chuck it.  I wouldn't throw it in the ocean. No, I wouldn't even do that. I am environmentally conscious. I wouldn't I wouldn't be like you, but I wouldn't. I'm not I really feel strongly about that.  I would never linger like that. But the point is, I can get rid of that fucking phone. Yeah, it's not a part of my body once they're injecting I talked about this way, too many podcasting around.  But there's a company that had these people inject a microchip in their arm and they could wave it in front of the soda machine and get fucking snacks with it and shit. It was like your tab was on your arm. It all. Mike's here. Open the door, unlocked the door, get the fuck out of here.  And we were saying, like, what if that company fires you? You would have Chipotles fires. You got that Chappellet chip in your arm?  I was management sort of regular Chappellet chip, I imagine. You imagine.  And now you have to work for fucking seven up and seven up. It's like we're gonna have to cut your arm off. Yeah.  Because he keeps registering that you're a Chipotle invader, you know, you ten chips in your arm because you worked at. Right. Kept kept a new job.  Get new chips. Mike, why don't you get those chips removed. I like them. They remind me of had a hard life and a lot of good jobs.  All these chips all around is I am proud of my chips.  I've got so where I've always been, always been a hard worker. Oh, I earn these chips. I earned all. These trips, every single one of these ships means, you know, also when you combine those ships with augmented reality so that you could have a visual floating around them is like the mascot of the various companies they work for are like, you know, like let's say we do get the chip right. The chip exists and we all just somehow decide, like, yeah, let's just do it.  I mean, fuck the whole book of revelations that it's all bullshit. Oh, Mark of the Beast. Let's get the chip that I just some some ancient bullshit. All right. Come on. I want to I want to get sodas without having to pull out my fucking wall. Yeah, it sucks. I'm sick of it. I'm exhausted all day from this activity, but we all get the chips. And then what happens is, of course, it would start off with like a decision to make.  Like, you're like what what data in the chip do you want people to be able to see with augmented reality? And so, like, this is where you run into what I think the future is going to look like, what this is. It's like it's like when you're walking around in your company and you're employee of the month and everybody's wearing augmented reality goggles, you're going to have some kind of employee of the month halo around you. So everybody's aware that you made the most sales.  You know, you're going to be like this shit.  Yeah, it's and it's going to be like that for like, you know, it's going to be brutal as far as, let's say, credit scores go. Right. Because if you've got a great credit score and you want to indicate to the world that if you want to get into debt, you can baby because you've got a great credit score, you're going to have this glowing shit around you, me. And like in the moment one person decides to reveal that everybody's going to feel like they have to reveal it.  And if you see someone who doesn't have, like, the good credit score crown or whatever, like the banner of great credit flowing in front of them, you're like, yeah, you're pretty fucked, right? Like you made some bad decisions. You'll see someone who's got a lot of shit, nice car, really nice clothes. But you'll be like, yeah, but, you know, he doesn't he doesn't have the glowing medallion of good credit on his self.  SS I don't know if he really owns any of that stuff, you know. And then and you know, I mean then it's going to like there's going to be all forms of that which leads to like, you know, like venereal disease, like you could go into a bar and if you just got tested and you're clean, so to speak, then maybe there's like a little r like clean angel that, like, flies around your has like he does it every means we get feedback and like, you know, like that kind those bits of data that that if you don't show them, there's some reason to be suspicious.  Yeah. You know what I mean.  Oh yeah. You walk up to someone, they have no data, they're just blank. You'd be terrified. Yeah. You just a person who I'm supposed to trust. You could be a serial killer. Fuck that.  We're going to look back on times when we just would meet people like this and not have some halo to go by. Yeah, like if I see Jamie, Jamie, you have like a nice golden glow. But look at him.  He's got a high approval rating. He's got some cash. Yeah, that's a good catch. Yeah. There you go.  If you go to a nightclub, all the dudes who are glowing gold. Yeah.  People be like, oh, girls like purple credit scores, they come in and try to get close to the guys in the gold, try to get a little gold, clean up that credit.  Yeah.  Yeah, man, I'm sure if you knew, like if a girl was really hot, you look at her credit card. Oh my God. Bank fraud. Look at her. She's a bank fraud. Yeah. Like that.  You don't get that gray outline unless you do bank fraud.  That's right. Yeah. And there's no way to get it off. It's like imagine. Yeah. That and that, you know, there's going to be big arguments about that where it's like, you know, currently if you're a registered sex offender, we know where you fucking live. And I get it man. Like that's good. That's good. But then it's going to be like, OK, but do we put that in there, augmented reality check profile so that anywhere they go, people are seeing that this is a person that hurts kids, you know, and there's going to be a conversation about that.  We're being like, fuck, yeah, that's what you do. Like, I want to know if some, like, weirdo is like getting anywhere close to my kid. Right? Fuck, yeah. You let it in. Anyway, that's the slippery slope that leads to the dystopian, like, you know, black meare future in that gray episode where like there was like, you know, and I think they are doing it in China.  They're doing in China. Yeah. They have a legit social score in China. This is a real concern. If this technology does get released in time and people start using their covid tests and putting it on their Kyouko QR code, that little thing that you do with the photo and it scans you like a plane ticket. Yeah, like, oh, you're good. Duncan seems like you're good. Make sure you keep that phone on you everywhere you go.  No problem, officer.  You know, Duncan, we got an email the other day that shows that you have been going I don't know who has this data, but you've been going down to San Clemente. During the lockdown, yeah, to stay with friends now there's a gloryhole there that I like, this is not allowed what you're traveling like.  See, look, what if we do this?  What if we go into this scanning thing and then a new pandemic pops up and we go into lockdown again, they're going to be able to find the people that are locked down.  What have you got to drive somewhere in the middle of the night to go get something, something important for your family? Yeah, well, you're you're being tracked and then they call you Dukan.  Where are you going? Where are you going?  We are looking at you right now. You're in San Clemente. You don't live in San Clemente. Why are you down there? Yeah, but I you know, I've just freedom. I want to drive around. I don't know. This is a lockdown.  Yeah, there's a new flu. Go back home, Duncan.  You want to kill people.  It's a weird it's a weird power to give people the power to have a mayor tell you what you can do. That's never happened before. I'm not saying they're doing it because that I know why they're doing it. They're doing it to save lives. I'm 100 percent for it. I'm not. Don't get me wrong here.  But still, that power that anybody has to say, you can't work, you got to stay home. You can't go to the park.  You can't go to the beach. That power is weird. That's a lot of power, man. Yeah, you know, to be the person Gavin may reopen. Not yet. Yeah, yeah, not yet.  But but what if the social distance they need to make money.  Yeah. We need to save lives. Yeah. It sucks. Yeah. It's is no good answer.  It's a shit job man. It's the shittiest, that's the shittiest job because it's like, you know, decision you make is going to make everybody happy. Any decision you make is going to ruin someone's life, maybe kill them. And so yeah, all these people.  So no one thought that was going to be a part of the job, right.  Yeah. You didn't think that you thought you were going to deal with like. Yeah, Gavin wasn't like he didn't know that when he got in there he was suddenly going to be like potentially like one of the war leaders in Mad Max. You didn't understand that was going to be his world, too. This is how poorly they thought this through.  Garcetti is giving people money to snitch. They're giving people money to snitch on social distance violators. Yeah, so if you go over your buddy Mike's house for a barbecue, there's eight people in that backyard. Helen look, that's fucked up, ain't fucking people. We're over here. Social distancing that. Duncan Trussell, he's over at Mike's house barbecuing, drinking beers, probably wife swapping. Pegg's. Why I get Garcetti comes along and offers people money to rat you out, how much they get.  I was wondering if they've even done that. It can't be real. I saw that it was it was real. They're offering rewards. Why is it to rat out social distance violators? Disgusting.  I mean, how how you don't know that leads to Maoist China and fucking Stalinist Russia. How you don't know that getting people to rat on people leads to North Korea, not saying we're going to be in North Korea, but that that kind of shit, that's where that comes from.  It's how it starts.  You can't pay people to rat people out, you fucking asshole. What? It's shitty, poorly thought out idea.  That is no shit, man. They're like any form that I saw something popped up on my Instagram. Some company saying, if you're aware that your bosses are violating like software like don't have license software, you know, we'll give you a reward. And finding people like disgruntled employees who know that their boss is running like stolen Photoshop or whatever to like make a little money and fuck their boss over. And it's like that invitation to snitch. That is a satanic invitation, man.  That is like I don't care what level it's at, like in general, unless you're looking at, like, hardcore Snowden level whistleblower, like you've been down in the deep underground military bases and you saw the fucking thing in the AG. They could read your mind and you're like, I can keep it to myself. I'm can't fucking tell people exactly how I get that.  But like any other versions of it. Yeah, fuck that. Don't invite us to snitch. Don't encourage that behavior. There's better ways to do it, I'm sure, than like bounties on your fucking neighbors. That's fucked.  So fucked up, which is so fucked up that someone who would get as high as mayor of Los Angeles would let an idea like that slip through the cracks. Well, like what a fucking fascist do you have working in that office that like, I got an idea to pay people to rat people out?  Yeah. These fucks, they haven't been working. You need money for masks. Yeah, that's it.  He did say snitches get rewards, but he said it's the opposite of snitches. Get stitches. Yeah. I can't phone.  No, they'll definitely get stitches. I can't find anything saying like they get fifty bucks. Hundred bucks. This is the reward you get. He might be the opposite of snitches.  Get stitches as if they're not still snitches and as if snitches don't still get stitches. Right.  What are you talking about? You're going to you're going to absolutely make sure that these people don't get beat up for being snitches. You're going to step in with cops, give them 24 hour security guards if you find out your neighbor ratted you out for money. Oh, my God, you'd want to kill him. It would be like what happened to that dude? What's his face? Ron Paul's kid. You know, I'm talking about now the congressman who got tackled.  That's right, and Rand Paul, Rand Paul, his his neighbor was like, fuck you just out of nowhere, tackles him, smashes his ribs. He lost a piece of his lung.  Yeah, man, that's fucked up. And it's like because you're what you're asking for there, which is another thing that I think the state anytime anyone starts doing this, then you really have to start thinking about who who you voted for. But like, because the idea is like, I love it when you know and I'm cheesy and I am a fucking hippie and I get accused of stoner talk and shit. But yeah, I want there to be world peace and I want people to love each other.  And when I see, you know, any even the slightest thing that, like, transcends political divides where like, you know, people who've hated fucking Trump and people Trump, Aveda, I saw something where, like, I can't remember who it was, like, God, what's the name of the Mormon politician that was running for president against Mitt Romney?  Romney.  So some dude, like, voted against releasing money to people who don't have jobs. And Mitt Romney tweeted, well, that senator, whoever he was tested positive for being an asshole.  And Mitt Romney, Mitt Romney said that and fucking you know, and then like there was this just flickering moment where Trump read tweets that says something about it and says, like, I didn't know he had that sense of humor, but I liked it.  And like, for that one stupid moment, there's a second where it's like that's we're supposed to be on the same team. Right. And like, you know, that's not a political statement, but that's like a statement of survivability. And when you have a fucking when you have an again, I'm not saying bad out of the state or anything like that either. It's the opposite of what I'm saying.  I'm not saying therefore, we all got to be upset because none of that shit. I'm not saying any of that shit, man. So don't take this the wrong way because I know what I'm saying. I get it. What I'm saying is when anything that divides one neighbor from the next, anything that invites neighbors to divide instead of unite is cancerous literally for society in the sense that what's going to start happening is that the the pixel of society is that the neighbors that's like the connection between your neighbors makes up the tapestry of the entire country in that connection.  If it's broken or weird or fucked up, then that's that's fucking everything up. And so did invite that invite. Anything that fucks that up is, to me, really, really long term disastrous. It's like the idea would be like, hey, does your is your neighbor an old person? Go find out if your neighbor is an old person and can't get food. And if they are and you get food to them, we'll pay for it.  Right. How about that? Yes, that's beautiful. Like you you know, someone who's like, fucked up right now. Let us know so we can make sure they're not their kids aren't starving. Right. Are there any do you know, like man, what about the fucking kids whose parents are right now super fucking sick with this shit? Like why we need governors and we need people saying, like, you need to know where the kids are in the building.  So whose parents are sick so we can make sure those kids are getting taken care of while their parents are in bed and shit like.  So fuck that. That is what people get rewards for that.  Why don't we have a way of monetising kindness in acts of like grace to your neighbors instead of monetizing like you becoming like literally what is a universally derided thing, which is a snitch. You don't want to be a snitch. Fuck snitches get stitches. No, maybe they don't get stitches. But, man, I'll tell you, when you die, I wouldn't want to be you wouldn't want to be a snitch in the afterlife. I'll tell you that, man, you get devoured by spirit wolves like I bet just the spirit wolves.  I'm sure you don't get the, like, experience of, like, you know, going through the bar, seeing your mom come running to you like a bowl of soup. It's your mom. She comes running to you and you think it's a bowl of soup, but you look in it, it's your wife's head and then you look back up. It's a spirit, Wolf. That's like. So you thought it was smart to snitch in that dimension, huh?  Na na, eat your soul forever. Yeah, maybe just don't snitch. That's fucked up. I mean.  Well, it's just ridiculous that someone in a position of real leadership. Right. You're the mayor of a huge city and you would think that that would be a good idea. Let's listen. People are going to snitch on people anyway. To encourage them with financial reward is crazy.  Crazy. It is crazy. And it's so poorly thought out.  Yeah, that's a dumb idea to put out there.  Such a poor understanding of human nature. Yeah. Like you don't know where this goes. Yeah. Like in an also in a time of great duress, you're encouraging people to snitch. Yeah, this is absolutely the time we've got to be encouraging comaraderie, yeah, this is when things are weird. Everybody's forced into the same position. No one can do what they want.  Last time you were on stage, I haven't been on stage in a month.  I've been doing private shows for my son who can't show that gay will be literally our job has stopped and our job might not come back until January.  Yeah, that's right. Maybe he knows. Who knows? We don't know.  I've got some gigs booked and I don't know if I'm going to be able to do him. I got a gig booked in September. I got to two in September and a couple in October. I got Tuba's.  But it's like also it's not like you should be like you can't really promote the show right now without seeming like a blazing dick. I don't want to encourage people to go out. And it's like, yeah, that's the problem, man, is we you know, we're but here's the thing. This whatever the state is doing, the state's going to do it. This is my favorite Jesus sang offer under Caesar. What is Caesar's? Which is like, you know, there's a game going on here with power.  And if you think you're going to subvert that game, maybe probably not the best thing to do. Let the dragon do whatever the fuck the dragon is going to do. But don't let them. Caused you to forget that you don't need the state to, like, go over to like leave a note on your neighbor's door asking if they're OK. Right. You know what I mean? You don't need we don't need the mechanisms of some bureaucracy to do good.  Like to pick up trash. Right. You know, like that was a thing that happened when the fucking national parks all got defunded because of this bullshit. All of a sudden, like there's people are taking pictures of garbage in the national parks. Right. And the implication of that is like we can't clean this up ourselves. We need a state official to come and pick the trash up. And it's like it's nice that they do that and we pay taxes for that and they should do that.  But if they're not doing it and we're waiting for some hero from the state to come in and fix our fucking problems, that's lazy. That's bad thinking. It's like I think it's a people the idea is more to, like, transcend that addiction to being saved, that addiction that for sure someone's coming. Sometimes they come right. But sometimes they don't. And that's no reason to, like, put off just the basic shit man. Like, you know, we we put out sometimes in front of our house, we'll just put out shit to give to people.  You know, we've got fruit trees, there's fruit, you know, there's like gardens got like some shit growing in it. I'll put it out there, you know, and and people take every bit of it. You come back at the end of the day, it's you know, we've got flowers, so cut some flowers and just leave flowers out there. And Jason wants to bring a flower to somebody. It's an act of trust because you don't know what I might be covered in, like covid mucus doing like drills for my neighbors.  But that being said, I don't know, maybe they're is sanitising. But my point is like, cool shit happens. Sometimes you go out of that box and like they've replaced something like we gave flowers away. We came out and someone had put different kinds of flowers in the box for those flowers, you know what I mean?  You got a stalker? Yeah. Actually, now I think about it.  The flowers, you know, it did seem like there was some something like sticky and creamy on the flowers. But, you know, I'm saying like, again, this this to me, this not getting too much in the macro because I'll go insane if I get in the macro getting into the micro, which is your direct, literally your direct neighbors and like making some connection with them. You know, like my the guy who lives across the street, we talk for like two minutes and was wonderful.  And he's like, if you need tools, just let me know. I got a ton of tools. Just you can like, you know, message me and I'll come and leave them here and you can come and get them shit like that. That's nice. It's cool. And it's like it's just beautiful. It's like that's what it's supposed to be like. Yeah.  That's nice. You got a good neighbor. That's it. Yeah. Have a good neighbors is everything.  Every people that hate their neighbors like man you should just move, save yourself some agony.  Yeah well you can't sometimes that's the problem.  But we all know we talked about this before. We need to find a Cul-De-Sac and I'll buy houses there.  You mean the cult. Yes, I know. Well, using a ranch would do the trick.  It's tough to get people to live on a ranch.  No, the way you're talking about. I know your type. Yeah, it's not that hard. But, you know, I think the way you do it is in phases.  Right? So, like, the first thing would be just get the land. Right. Right. And then hire an architect. Yeah. Hire an architect and then like, you know, bring in Alex Cray.  Yeah.  That that thing that he did in upstate New York. Beautiful. Have you been there personally? I've been there in there. I haven't unfortunately I haven't been there since its completion. I don't know if it's completed, but I've been there in the early phases and yeah that for sure is a temple. Like it's no joke, it's not like they're just saying it's a temple.  That's a real and the way he printed those weird faces, those multi feature faces and use them in the corners of the building, what does he call it again? I can't remember.  I'm sorry, Kazem, cause I thought you meant what he called those faces.  He has a name name for the faces do is that the chapel of sacred mirrors is what it sounds for. But isn't that a cosmos was used to be what he called the place in New York City. Right? He had the place in Manhattan. Yeah, they had this.  I think they still well, they still do have a place in New York actually, or like an artist's loft there, I believe. But like they they ended up realizing it was time to like, spread their wings, build a temple.  Yeah. And then really go somewhere in nature. Yeah. They're in like a small New York town, right. Yeah. That's New York State town. Yeah.  It's a beautiful place. Oh. And they're a religion and. That's right. And they're an actual religion which they are. They are. I mean that religion. Yeah. It is a religion.  And by the way, religion is one of anything from you like they're not I'm not trying to get ten percent of your money and giving you a bunch of rules to follow.  Now they want you to worship, love and creativity. It's a really interesting place. Is that oh, that's that's just an image of what it's going to look like. I don't think it's really quite there yet, but holy shit, yeah, I imagine coming up to that, like walking up to their front door, you know, like, oh my God, what the hell am I looking at?  Dude, when I was on tour, they let me start my tour bus there because we needed a place to sleep for the night. So I had to sleep in front of that thing on my tour bus. And I and I hadn't even gotten to that base, but I had crazy dreams. Just leave me there. Yeah, it was wild, man.  That's probably like one of those. If you build it, they will come things like you imagine how hard you would trip inside that place. Do you know I'm saying yeah, no, I don't think it's I don't think it's a bit like you could do DMT in a shitty apartment and still have some crazy mind blowing trip.  But you can't tell me that coming to this place and going through this Indian portal. Yeah.  This is going to have some fucking crazy effect on the way you trip. Yeah.  Oh, my God. But, you know, that was the idea of a temple. I mean, the idea is not I'm not just saying to trip or whatever, but the concept is like, you know, let's acknowledge the fact that maybe our ideas aren't necessarily coming from inside our brains. Let's just as a fantasy, imagine that there is a divine intelligence that as one of the many beautiful things it pushes into this particular realm is art, and that if we can figure out a way to purify the connection with that thing, then we become receivers for that.  And by doing that, we allow that thing to begin to exist in this world. And a temple was a place that allowed that connection to be refined, purified, internationalized. And in that there's a solidification called inspiration or art or whatever the name is. You want to give it. But it's really it's like output from a place that maybe is, you know, a few a few floors up from the one where it's having a pretty wonderful party right now.  And like, part of what we do is like allow it to drip into this room, which is potentially denser room. We're in the realm of matter. It's dense, you know, and like ideas. If you look at your ideas, they're they're light. They're like they're they're they don't have a lot at least my ideas, like they're not like heavy inspiration feels like barely anything. In fact, it's so barely anything to think how easy it is to miss a good idea, how easy it is to think something cool that maybe you want to write down for a joke and you just write that down later and then it's gone.  It's light. It's light. And so in part of what they're, I think are all about or I mean, again, that's me putting it on them. They have a wonderful description on their website about what they're all about. But to me, part of what creation is, is taking those things, allowing them to come through you, and then allowing this realm to do what it does, which is to crystallize them in a denser form that other people can enjoy.  And you know, that that enjoyment is a you know, that's enough. Doesn't have to be some lofty shit.  It's just like people get a little like this tiny little smell of heaven.  I like a better place, a lighter place, a place that isn't encumbered by so much bullshit is this particular realm that can, like, completely take someone out of a depression, man that can completely give somebody the, you know, juice they need to, like, get back out there and, like, open up themselves to the world and not be shut down. Just one little like tiny, tiny, minuscule reminder of like, don't worry, there's this isn't the only place.  There's simultaneously amazing things happen happening which you're part of. You just don't realize it yet. And don't worry, you know, McKennis, that in one of his essays, that's what he did say on mushrooms, is you get this message, don't worry, we're coming.  Don't worry, we're coming. And you know what I mean.  But I think that's what art does, is it gives you that sense of like, don't worry, right now we're just building their own way. Don't worry, it's coming. I know this this place seems fucked up. It's a little dense right now. We're going to lighten it up. And then that's how much of that is your own imagination, though?  Like how much of your own imagination stimulates your trips? Hmm.  You know, I mean, we want to assume that we're really interacting with something right on the other side.  But why why do we assume that that's something obviously it's not static.  One of the things about tripto mean experiences, the things twist and change and morph and shift and never they never stay any one thing for any length of time. They're always becoming other things and moving in and out of things like.  Maybe that's just what happens over there, maybe these things are constantly shifting and changing. You know, maybe what we're doing is we're trying to apply when we think of how we are here in this little life, we're trying to apply those laws to whatever we experience when when we when we do that. But it seems so alien when you have those experiences, it seems so you're not going to be able to bring any of that back. You can give someone like little glimpses.  And what Alex has done the best is capture like, oh, I know what he's doing. Like those faces, those like almost Egyptian looking golden faces moving and apart from each other, like you go, oh, yeah, I've seen something.  Yeah, some sort of. Yeah, there's a trip to mean part to that. Yeah. But that whatever that would it be in that dimension it would change and become something else and instantaneously and then become something else.  And then, and a lot of it has to do with how you're thinking which is weird. It's like ah this is the way you are thinking actually affecting those things or is the way you're thinking it affecting your perception of whatever this energy is and how it manifests itself visually?  Well, I mean, this is that right? Even in what you're saying, there's this assumption that your thinking is separate from the thing. Right. Right, right. And so and so we have a thought and we're thinking to ourselves, oh, I just got a good idea. We don't know that if we had a different way of quantifying time and space, we might have just seen some ethereal mist drift through us that produced that thing. We got a thought that we thought must be us.  So you look at a thing in that realm and it's shifting and converting and you notice that that conversion seems to be happening in relation to like how you're feeling. And, you know, now you're in a chicken or the egg conversation, which is like who's you know, who's reflecting who here, like who?  Which of us is like real and which of us isn't? Are we just kind of there? I am I just seeing who I actually am. But because I live in a world of individuality and I live in a world where there's a separate quality to things, I have to see you as separate because if I don't, I can't see you in all I can. You know, I'm seeing myself in you, which is I think what they're what is happening in this realm anyway is like when we're anything you're looking at right now is some phenomena being painted instantaneously by your imagination, whether that's what the imagination is doing.  It's painting colors onto the universe of infinite phenomena that you're your brain is like doing out of habit. So that's that's that, you know, anything that anyone you're around, you make an instantaneous assessment of that person or you begin to like, realize like, wait, I got a bad vibe about that person. I bet something's off of them. And then you go into like you're a TV psychic bullshit like. Oh yeah. Really. Oh, really.  Is that your was that the instincts you learned? Where did you learn that? World War Street. Yeah. You don't know. But I've done that. I'm by the way I'm talking about myself. I'm like, yeah, I just can tell if a person is on a it's like no you can definitely tell if a person's really fucking weird.  That's for sure. You could tell the person's off like they're not really connecting with you or they turn into connected, you know, like, well, I got a weird vibe from this.  Yeah. That even if you looked at what he said on paper, what you said on paper would be totally normal. That's true. There's sometimes a certain things, a violation of space. There's a weirdness to the way they look at you. Occasion's.  Yeah. They're like, oh, you're off. Hate that, Fieldman. That's that's a deeper thing. When the alarm bells go off like that, your hair starts standing up. You're like, oh, I've got to go. I fucking hate that. That's scary. But, you know, I'm just saying, sometimes you're not right. And this is like why you need empiricism and science because sometimes you're not right. Like, just because you think that's how shit is from some instinct inside of you doesn't mean that's how things is you're biased.  And so that that's the projection. That's like the that's the part of you that you're like you're still dealing with some trauma when you're a kid and you're seeing that trauma in all the things around you. And so you're like in an argument with someone who hurt you twenty years ago. When you're talking to somebody who vaguely reminds you of that person, you to be like you're still having the argument.  And if you're not aware that you're still having that argument, then you can start saying shit like, why do you always end up with the same person?  Yeah, it's like, well, I always draw this kind of person to me and it's like, well, maybe you're drawing the exact same kind of person to you, or maybe you're on in the same movie on a different screen and being like, I've seen this before, I keep seeing this movie, you know, it's like that's the same movie. It's like you're seeing the same thing you're projecting. It's just it looks like now it's not Tom, it's Alex or now it's not Lisa.  You're looking at Samantha, but you're still seeing this thing and that that's the projection. So anyway, that's the imagination. And the question is, how powerful is that projection? Because sometimes you start projecting onto someone how you think they are. And if that person's weak or insecure, they'll start acting the way you think they are. Yes. Now, you've your projection is sprung to life in front of you because the person is essentially animated a person with your expectation of them, and then because that person is acting the way you thought they would act because they don't know what the fuck they are.  You're making monsters with your imagination.  That's what companies do, right? That's how you start a sex cult. Wow. Same way you got to take these people and put it in their head that this is what they do.  Oh, well, I put it in their head, right?  Yeah, that's right. You say you see it. Yeah, I see it in you.  Well, in this book I told you about this book, Chaos, Tom O'Neill's book on Manson and the CIA. Yeah. That's how, you know, I saw your tweet about it. Oh, my God, dude, what is. Oh, my God. Someone's tied up with this. Oh, my God. Almost definitely a part of these fucking psychedelics LSD experiments that they were doing on hippies almost definitely experimented on him, probably in prison, but almost definitely allowed him to get out of when he violated his parole, let him loose, let him free.  Supply him with acid. Yeah, monitor him. They they were monitoring him every step of the way. They, like, fed that monster. They knew that this guy had been incarcerated half his life. He was a con man and they taught him how to be a cult leader. They taught him how to be a cult leader. And they probably talked him into or taught him how to talk people into killing people and to do so with acid.  And they would dose him up and he would make people do all kinds of shit, like it would take people like, OK, you're going to fuck her and he's going to fuck him. And they would put they would put together these orgies. He would put together orgies. I mean, he was sodomized in front of one of them, like, horrific.  Shocked. Yeah, yeah. He was like some boy that was like fifteen years old.  He did crazy, crazy shit. They were all on acid. They all the committed murder. He he directed them to commit murder. But all of this very connected to the CIA's MK Ultra project.  All of it. Yeah, I'm very connected to multiple different in multiple different ways connected to LSD and hippies, LSD and mind control, LSD trying to come up with a Manchurian Candidate, trying to get someone to commit murder and not even realize they did it.  Also connected to Lee Harvey Oswald because Jack Ruby was all fucked up on that program when he killed Lee Harvey Oswald and afterwards went completely insane, was seen by the very same doctor that was running the clinic where Manson used to go. This guy was a CIA doctor, was a psychologist or psychiatrist, dosing people up with LSD, running studies on prisoners, getting students to run studies, getting scientists to run studies, not even knowing they were doing it through the CIA.  Kazinsky to don't forget. Oh, yeah, Kazinski. How about Operation Bendit?  Climax ran brothel's in San Francisco and a couple other places where they dosed people up with acid and watched them fuck dare they name it that I know.  Midnight climax.  That's so. It sounds like, you know, it sounds like that sounds like the name of like porn in a hotel that you go wild. Yes, like a secret agent that sucks everyone's dick midnight climax. Whoever named that really tells you a lot about the program.  But like, you know, man, the here is a controversial fucking thing to say, which someone reminded me of a while ago, which really freaked me out. Kinda, which is like back then. Like, they're like right now, we know a little bit more about some of the shit the CIA did a lot of it because they put it on their website. Yes. Which is so crazy to me. They just put it up on their website, which is crazy.  And but back then, what they put up on their website, dude, are you fucking kidding?  Like all this shit about the remote viewing experiments they did like it's they just I interviewed that main guy that they had for remote viewing was that fucking famous guy.  This there's one famous guy that I interviewed. He's like famous in the remote viewing world.  I know you're the guy who wrote that movie or didn't write it, but the documentary man who still shot that, we see the guy talked about a kill shot or that's what the name for the thing that happens when the sun fucks up. I didn't fuck up. I mean, who am I to say the sun fucked up? But for us it fucked up. Does like a not a supernova, but just does a big ass flare that like kind of like melts whatever side of the earth happens to be facing it.  You know, that's like the kill shot that a lot of these remote viewers were apparently saying that they were seeing because they were realizing that they could actually they weren't sort of bound by time and these visions and they all started sharing this vision and this thing.  It's really a creepy, creepy documentary out there, man, but that's about 100 percent on the table, like some giant solar flare, some solar incident. That's a hundred percent on the table.  Have we, by the way, I'm sorry. We talked about this the last episode. If we talked about the CIA's website yet, what about their website?  Have you ever gone to it? No.  Jamie, would you mind pulling that up? I've applied for a job. What do I have to do?  You apply for a job with the CIA? Well, I when I was stone and it was late at night and I'm like, wait, you can apply online.  Check it. We'll ask Molly. There's a cartoon. Yeah, hold on. Back up. This is a CIA. Ask Molly, your CIA source on the inside and it's hashtag ask Molly Hale and my Hales like a hot agent. This week's Ask Molly Hill question comes from a writer who wants to know if there's a path forward for them at CIA since they have done illegal drugs in the past. They took my question.  That's your question now. I'm just kidding. It seems it seems like it's your question since they have done illegal drugs in the past.  Let's see what Molly's answer is. Let's see. We always answer. So it says, fine, Molly's answer. What does Molly say?  Dear sir, let me be clear on this from the get go, having previously used illegal drugs does not immediately disqualify you from working at CIA. If working for CIA is your life's goal, and we certainly hope it is, there could be a path for you here.  With that said, there's certain there are certain restrictions you should be aware of, especially if you've used illegal drugs within the past year. Generally speaking, to be eligible for CIA employment, applicants must not have used illegal drugs within the past twelve months. Damn shit. This is, as with most things, a general rule by which to gauge your higher ability.  That's on the word kids, not a type, only an applicant, but not only an applicant, but as the potential holder of a security clearance might seem a bit archaic, but consider the access to information we're giving it CIA employees and consequences of granting access to the wrong person. How much access to information? Just read that real quick. It might seem a bit archaic, but consider the access to information we're giving. It's giving CIA employees. What access are you giving them?  You're in a simulator. That's the first thing they say after you get hired. They're like, it's a simulator. We're just doing like what the programmer wants. It's like, I know you're going to freak out for two months. We're going to give you like a protocol of antidepressants because you can go nihilistic or absurd is when you realize you're just a string of code that's running, but you'll get over it and then there's an egg. You know, the thing reads your mind.  It's kind of cool. Show you that later.  Officers regularly handle classified information, which, if leaked, could spell disaster for national security and endanger the life of CIA officers. Here's my favorite word. Assets and their family assets is one of my favorite words to use. We have an asset in Jerusalem.  An asset. You are an asset. Is it a person? You know a guy. Yeah, well, he's an asset. He's asset.  Yeah, he's a like a no. Like, what's an asset. An asset is like stocks. You got an asset.  You got to.  I got stock in Palestinians. I got some Palestinians saved up.  Yeah. Got some assets. Just some people you connected with connect with them their assets.  Yeah. You now you may be wondering. That's all fine Molly but I live in a state where marijuana use was legalized under state law. So why would any of this really apply?  In my case, the short answer is, or would any of this really apply? In my case, the short answer is yes. Marijuana remains illegal under federal law in every state. The CIA is bound by federal law, which prohibits CIA from granting security clearances to unlawful users of controlled substances, including marijuana. State laws do not supersede those of the federal government. The great lord who looks over the land. The Iron Fist for more information regarding the federal government's security clearance guidelines regarding drug use and other considerations, you can check out the what if the next time was like, hey, what's up, Joe?  That's cool. You're showing this on your podcast now. Now. It's a simulation, but I do think, like in their is, they're also kind of saying like that being said, if you can set it on fire with your mind or something when you're stoned, come talk to us. It's like, you know what I mean? There are saying, like, the other cool thing when you look at him applying for a job is it says after you apply, don't tell anybody you apply for the job.  We'll like approach you regarding the job, which is so fucking cool.  You can't talk about it when you apply there.  Meanwhile, they're absolutely checking your phone. They're checking your eye applied. And like I just leaned into the fact that, like, fuck it, they're going to look at everything I do. And then also like imagining that at some point some CIA agent might come up to me like, hey, what's up, man? Hey, what's going on? Did you really want to be a bookkeeper at the Pentagon?  No, I wanted to meet a CIA agent, dude. Hadlow because, I mean, you know, wouldn't you wouldn't you like to me?  I'm not No. One, you know, a CIA agent.  I've had them on the podcast multiple times. Mike Baker does a lot of consulting for TV shows and security stuff.  So you are an. And is he working for them now?  No. Well, how would you say. Yeah, he's a former CIA operative. What does that mean? Do you really think they ever stop talking to each other? No, no. He does security clearance stuff and security staff is going to has a security company.  Did he. So sweet. So this guy did you ask him about the Manson shit?  No, I just found out about this really recently. Fitzsimmons told me about this guy. Tom O'Neil was his neighbor for like twenty years. He was neighbors of Greg and Greg the whole time he was doing this book while Greg was friends with them, it took him 20 years to write.  This book started out as an article for premier magazine. And then as you started uncovering all these inconsistencies with the trial, he realized that there was kind of a bullshit trial and that the prosecuting attorney, like everybody there was there was deals that everybody had made to have a specific narrative go through. And Susan Atkins, one of the one of the people from the Manson family, is on trial.  Her her fuckin defense attorney was like a former prosecuting attorney that had worked with Vincent Bugliosi and all these other people before they were all buddies and they signed him to her to take over for her state appointed attorneys.  This guy took over and like just they just they followed directions, like everybody follow directions. And as he was going deeper and deeper into this story, he realized, like there was a lot of crazy shit that was going on. The first of all, Manson for sure, was let out of jail multiple times when he shouldn't have been when he was violating parole and he was let out of jail repeatedly for crazy shit like theft. And, you know, and they they were monitoring these people.  They knew where they were staying. They knew the ranch, the spawn ranch where they were staying at.  They never did anything. They let them they let them go whenever they were in trouble and most likely got him the fucking LSD.  If you looked at the finders call, it was that one. I actually brought it up.  I'm not even doing a good job with this last description. So I didn't think I was going to talk about it. But this thing blew my mind. Like, you got to listen to this audio book, listen to the audio or just even maybe just listen to some of the podcast and you'll get sucked in. This guy was obsessed with this for twenty years. It's all he thought of. It's all he did was his life's work.  Do you do you OK, you had the CIA agent you had on his cool. Right. He seems a good guy. Is he your friend? I like the guy. So in you know what's so bizarre and like, I don't want to say it, but I think it's like because you say it and people see it and I see it all in the CIA. But something, you know, I was bitching to Rick Doblin about on a podcast and I was like doing this thing I used to do.  I was younger, which is like trying to create a all evil, all good binary regarding people who work like in the CIA or people who work in even the DEA or whatever that thing you do when you're like when you're when you're being lazy and your way of thinking or being binary. And in Doblin, one of the things he said to me that I've always kept with me is he's like, there's there's people like us, like all the way to the top.  You know, there's people who like look at drug laws right now in two people from the CIA.  Listen, this podcast. Right? Yeah, I know. I know of that. Right. So it's like I mean, yes. In this podcast. That's what I'm saying, man.  Is like the thing that the thing that's somewhat annoying in the sense that it requires nuance rather than like a heavy handed they're all evil is some of the people in there are really like one hundred percent trying to keep at least people here from getting blown the fuck up. And that that and like they're not like like, oh God. Like I mean, let's find another man and how he got, you know. Exactly, but in all, you know, I went and got this tour of actually JPL, the place Parsons was that man, and like I think it was BP or Shell or some oil company that I had.  Like, just generally we all look at the oil companies and think they're out there, though they're all the worst.  Well, you know why you're driving in your car. You'll be like these fucking oil companies.  But like the cars they were working on, some kind of new solar panel technology was like Shell or I don't remember which fucking company was. I remember saying to the guy like this technology, if it works, doesn't this destroy the oil industry? Like, don't they know they're working on a technology that's going to make the thing they make money selling and buying irrelevant.  And he's like, oh, now these companies are so big that there's departments within departments, within departments. And that's where it gets fucking crazy about the CIA, which is like they the people in the CIA don't know. Obviously, all the people in the CIA. That's your security clearance. And the question is, how deep is that basement go man under the CIA?  But here's also the question. Yeah. How are you going to find out what happens when people take LSD without giving people LSD and studying them? Ready. Go. You're not.  So if you're in 1953, OK, and you're finding out about LSD and people are taking LSD at parties and people taking LSD at concerts, and you start realizing the ramifications of a society in 1964, that's all taking LSD and you see this hippie movement, you're going to run some study.  So then you're going to give people the ability to test people without their knowledge.  You don't know how crazy that guy is, what kind of a sociopath that guy is, and he's going to run tests on people without their knowledge and give them LSD.  And then there's going to be people that say, hey, you know, we want to infiltrate all these anti-war groups. We want to infiltrate the Black Panthers, we want to infiltrate these hippies. Yeah. How can we do that? Well, here's how we do that. We take this guy. We got him in prison for half of his fucking life in federal prison. So far, he's 32 years old. Yeah. Let's dose this motherfucker up with LSD.  Let's run some studies on him and let's tell him that he's a cult leader and get him to make some apocalyptic fucking death cult that wants to kill people and rape pig on the wall and their blood. And so they let Manson they knew where he was. They knew he was getting acid. They knew that he was probably having people kill people.  Yeah, well, OK. First of all, to go back, man, if you really study the spread of LSD in the popular culture, it wasn't that the CIA saw people taking LSD at parties. It's at the CIA. As I understand, the story goes and buys from Sandos Laboratories all of their LSD and then begins to do tests on college campuses where people begin to take the LSD and then the party start. So it's I think it's more like the CIA started the party when it comes to LSD or at least were majorly involved in the initial experience people had with LSD, which was like that's when that's when you get Temeraire, that's when you get richer.  Alpe, you know, Ramdas that's they were both like hanging out at Harvard where the same psychology professor did this shit on Kazinsky was and like LSD, you know, that's they were doing I don't know if they were doing the LSD test there, but these tests were going on, they were being exposed to LSD that theoretically I don't know if it came from the CIA or not, but I don't know like where the I think actually those tests were they were ordering it from Sandos, but for sure, like who wrote One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest?  Damn it, I can't believe I can't remember the author's name. Yeah, Ken Kesey, he did one of the CIA, LSD. He was in one of the CIA LSD experiments. So that makes sense. And but and also, man, like back then, I don't think because we didn't get the Manson, the Kazinski or all the awful shrapnel, weird shards of chaos that exploded off of the crazy, unethical shit they did. I don't know if there was so much of an idea that they were evil.  I could be wrong about that. But they weren't even called the CIA. I think they were called the O.S.S. the beginning. Yeah.  But by the time the CIA was running a fucking clinic in Haight Ashbury that closed down after 30 years of being open to 40 years of being open, closed down three months after this book came out, like, well, that's a wrap.  Yes. Yeah. Jolli, w the same guy who visited Jack Ruby in the hospital. And after he left, Jack Ruby went insane, was crawling underneath the table and thought that Jewish children were getting lit on fire and cut apart in the streets. And a new holocaust was going on immediately, immediately, as they have no record of him acting insane before this at all.  He didn't even understand why he shot Lee Harvey Oswald. So fucked up. Yeah, well, they think that the same thing happened with Sirhan Sirhan, the guy who shot Robert Robert Kennedy.  They think that he was under the influence as well because he had the same reaction after he shot him, like, why am I here? What happened that they used LSD to somehow or another get these people to commit atrocities to to kill people, to murder people? Yeah.  I mean, yeah. And you can what's probably you can probably. I know you can if we go on to see the crazy thing is you can go on their website. Yeah. Look at the Freedom of Information Act archives and they have MK ultra shit up there right now that you can look at. That's where it gets really weird is it's like they're like, yeah, yeah.  But they never admit that they gave people that was the thing about Charlie was he never admitted that he gave people LSD and did studies on them. Never admitted it. I think while he was alive at least. I mean, I don't know if they're admitting it now because of the freedom of what they must, because Operation Midnight CLIMAXES, that's officially historical record. Yeah. Yeah. So they must be now.  But when they were when, you know, they were operating this clinic, Manson and the family were going into that clinic all the time. There's a direct there's a one hundred percent direct connection between the CIA doctors who are providing LSD to the hippies and Manson going to this clinic.  That is it's true. This book is crazy. Man, that does not sound like pandemic reading to me. That's the best. Are you sure, buddy? I don't know, man. Look like I'm already, like, weirded out by, like, just bad understanding of astronomy. It's like, you know what I mean? Like, I don't know that I need to, like, get in as shit about the CIA, especially because it's like, you know, I don't know, it's just too much, you know.  That being said, I'm going to definitely fucking read that book.  Well, just listen to the podcast. That's the easiest. You'll you'll get your dick wet, listen to the podcast, and then you're going to want to listen to the audio book or read the book.  But he has sixty pages of citations and references at the end of the book to show each thing and how he can prove it.  Like these are not this is he's got some speculation that he entertained at the very end of the book and we talked about it on the podcast. But the stuff that he knows for sure to be true is bonkers.  Can I ask you a question that will get made into like a YouTube clip accusing you of being an asset of the CIA?  Sure. So, OK, let's imagine this. One day you get contacted by somebody who was in the CIA and they show you convincing data regarding something, you know, whatever it may be, meteor impact, some other and pending danger. That is like you look at it and it's like whatever it is they give you, you you believe it. And they're like, listen, Joe, we know you're like we know that you're like a wild animal and we know that, like, you don't want to be dishonest and we understand that.  But we got to figure out a way to get this kind of information out to the world, because if we don't like it, it's going to be really bad and we're just going to people like you and just trying to get whatever that thing is. They want you to say a little thing, an idea of how they want you to be. And the they're not offering you money. They're not offering you money. And they're also like saying like, don't worry if you say no, don't you get that job with the CIA?  Excuse me, do I get the job? Did you get that job you applied for now? Seems like you're priming me.  What for? You're going to give me a suggestion later.  Listen, I know what you're doing, Macho. Have you ever thought of a blue butterfly?  Yeah, I do. Yeah. Yeah. But seriously, what would your response be if I was like, look, we just need your help.  Listen, I think Central Intelligence Agency, I think FBI. I think. I think the. I think they're all necessary. I don't think they're unnecessary. I think that most of what they're doing is trying to protect us.  The Illuminati logo for them. I do think also that some of those guys turned to fucking cowboys and try to fly Coke back from Mexico and crash CIA jets. That's true, too. Yes. All that shit that happened in Mena, Arkansas, you know, all that shit that happened when Clinton was governor with Barry SEALs, when they were running Coke back and forth and dropping off in Mena, Arkansas. That guy was a CIA contractor. There's a lot of those guys that were CIA.  Look, they got compromised, I think. But that doesn't mean the whole CIA's bad, doesn't mean we don't need a CIA man. If you talk to people, if they're honest, I don't know. They're let's just assume they're honest.  You talk to people that deal with trying to infiltrate terrorist groups and deal with tracking terrorists and deal with trying to figure out if someone's trying to make a dirty bomb, trying to figure out if someone's ready to blow up a mall and they're in there. They're doing this actively every day. All day. That's essential. That's essential.  So the CIA oh, fucking MK Ultra, they they don't people in whorehouses.  That isn't the same people. OK, this is a giant organization. Has been around for a long fucking time. Right. What you're hearing about from Jolli West and the Mykelti, those people are dead. Those are those are not alive today.  But, you know, you are is alive today. ISIS, you know who is alive today. A lot of threats all around the world. You know who is alive today? Kim Jong un, the leader of China, all these fucking dictators that are heavily armed all over the world.  There's a lot of them, right? You got to keep an eye on those motherfuckers, right? If you don't think you have to keep an eye on him, you're crazy, right? Well, the CIA is evil. No, no, no. Humans are evil. And sometimes you need someone who's paying attention to the evil people, right? Yeah, that's what you need. Now, does that mean that they're not going to stray across the lines of what is correct and good and fair and and start spying on regular people to know?  It doesn't mean that it means that shit needs to be curbed. That shit's on American right. But if you think someone might be a terrorist, like you should be able to find out before they blow up a fucking school. Totally right. We are one hundred percent.  So the question is, how good are these people at first walking that line?  Turns out pretty fucking good. Turns out pretty fucking good. There's a bunch of shit that's happened over time. But also they've gotten intel on all these different terrorists and all these different fucking terrible situations all over the world and probably saved a lot of people. Right. It's not perfect, but nothing's perfect. It's not a fucking thing that's perfect. Whether it's the fucking post office or police officers or fire department and doctors, no one's perfect, right? Including the CIA, including the FBI, including the Army, the Navy.  There's going to be problems. Right. But overall, they're trying to protect. I would imagine, if I had to ask, like, what are you guys here for? To make sure that shit doesn't hit the fan. We'll pay attention to the shit, pay attention. Do do some of them branch out into Coke business. Yes, I'm sure some of them. OK, I'm sure there's someone for the federal government that's selling guns to a bad guy right now.  I'm sure. I'm sure some people are people.  If you got a million people, you're going to get thirty bad ones or whatever the fuck the number is. It's just part of life.  Yeah, yeah. Look, I'm all for a CIA apologist. I set you up. I don't believe a word of what I just said. And my man. You took that job. Come on, man.  You know, I get a big bonus for that. Like, you know, I don't.  Yeah, I'm wearing a wire, bro. You don't have to wear a wire anymore. Just carry your phone. I'm wearing a wire on the podcast. I'm monitoring you.  Just imagine if you like. You got to close. The mike is a key. Jimmy's like, hmm, dude, interference. That's when I was a kid growing up, as I always want it, like when I was at the beach, that was always like something I'd fantasize about is like, fuck, I hope one of those drug bags washes up, you know, the water.  Like, how many of those wash up that people don't report?  You know, whenever I hear about someone who's like, oh my God, I found a briefcase full of cocaine, like, why are you that's the guy. That's Grace. Like, something is like delivered on to you. This bizarre thing at the very least, like, you know, I'm not a fan of Coke myself. It like makes me I hate it, in fact. Yeah.  But if you got some of that Ozzy Osborne from the 70s Coke, you know. Good. That shit would be cocaine.  Yes. I remember when we talk about government, weed, government, we was good.  Oh yeah. Unlike the cheese. Oh yeah. Government cheese is terrible, but government we do. He's got that government weed. Whoa. You remember that.  Yeah, I do man. I completely forgot about that was the thing back when weed was illegal. You wanted to shit the government was growing.  Wow. Yeah that's right. Yeah. Well because for sure by the way, you know there's a there's like I guess at the CIA, there's a layer of all the sober people you've like haven't gotten high for a year, whichever's writing that fucking thing is definitely like laughing as they're writing it. You know, they're like just laughing because they're so fucking high and they're like, all right, is the test, man.  There's a there's a level they test. But, you know, there's a level where you get past that level and like, listen to no drugs stuff, please. We want you to have a good time. This is a fine job. Like we know that you can handle your shit. We just have to do that level below you because otherwise the last thing you need is another fucking mance.  And you know what I always think about when I think of someone infiltrating a terrorist group, that scene in Team America World Police where the actor has the fucking terrible outfit on. We need actors to save the world.  Yeah, I always think it if I think about anybody infiltrating a terrorist group, I think of that guy.  Yeah, well, you know what?  This again, we don't have to worry about that. That to me is a fucking great thing. I don't have to worry about that. I don't have to worry about infiltrating a terrorist group.  You imagine if you remember, it was so good at acting. They just let me look so bad and they just they just believe him.  And he walks right through. Oh, my God.  Is this Moray's amazing? This movie's amazing, folks. If you've never seen Team America, World Police, I probably laugh harder in this movie than any movie I've ever seen in my life. It is so, so good team.  I mean, what a great name for the police.  And then also after you see the movie, go online and find the sex scenes that they had to delete.  So first of all, these guys are geniuses. And what they figured out is that if you just add way more than you really want, they let you have what you want. You got to add stuff like they I think she shit on his chest, right? They pissed all over each other. They've fucked like crazy. So it's a it's a plastic doll sex scene that's so, so crazy and graphic. And then when you watch it in the movie, it's like a fraction of this because they just they just went so far to sixty nine in each other.  That is ridiculous. Yeah.  And she is still violently sucking him off and they just keep so they did this so that they could have some of it in there.  I mean it's so long and so crazy and then once you think it's over then they start pissing and shitting all over each other. Now doesn't it keep going.  This is a clip from the back. Oh, that's from the actual movie. Oh, so that's how much they left and that's how much they left him because they cut out.  They got so savage with the sex scene that they let them keep the most preposterous amount in there because it was so far past that they just tricked them. They used like sleight of hand to that.  Must have been so funny filming that. I think it took a long time. Sure it did. Yeah.  Trey Parker was saying in some interview that he would never do that again. Like, that's too bad.  Stop motion. Yeah. Because Team America World Police is one of the funniest movies of all time. Sure. And you could there's so much in that movie like what they do with South Park that you could never do with a human. But you can do it with either a doll or a cartoon easily.  And it's amazing, like death that scenes like you killed Kenny. You couldn't have a guy just die every week on a sitcom. People were like, this is freaking me the fuck out.  Yeah, but he doesn't even look remotely real. He cut his head off. He can light on fire. He can blow up in an explosion.  Yeah, you can definitely get away with a lot more in that regard for sure.  Going away with everything. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's a genius way to do comedy. I don't know. I mean I like South Park is like it's eerie to me and their ability to quickly animate shit, it's maintains its relevance. Like it's insane that they're able to do that, like that they've got it down to that level of like, oh shit, something happened in the world and we're going to respond to it almost instantly.  Not only that, they do it mockingly but accurately, like they figure out how to ride that line.  And we laugh. And I just it I've never seen before from it. I'm like I said, I thought, oh, I thought it was made.  But it's not like this is Meryl Streep and this is Ben Affleck. Oh, Ben Affleck is just a hand at mixing blood with this.  They made Matt Damon and Ben Affleck really fucking dumb in that movie, right? Oh, yeah.  I'm Matt Damon. Yeah. Oh, shoot. Matt Damon is actually very smart.  Yeah, so rude. But it doesn't matter. They could just do that. Yeah. Do you do anything. Yeah. When you have like cartoons and puppets you can fucking do anything dude.  I mean that's that. But accept anything you want to do takes forever. I mean that is the problem. It's like yeah. You could do anything with that. Anything is like, you know, months of anything. So it's clearly easier to film shit or just to say it or I mean the fact that they used hands got God only knows how much money that saved them like that decision to just do that, how much time that probably saved him, who knows, like those kinds of like decisions and shows like that are like really smart and funny.  Yeah. But yeah, animation is like I mean it is spellbind it is is eating her ass slightly longer is longer.  It's not much different, to be honest with you. No, but there's a shift in the position, so but it's not coming up on here. What's.  Oh, there it is. Go back. There is. She drops a log on his face. It's perfect. And then I think she pisses on to actually right before that. Oh.  Oh, he pisses her and then she shits in his face. How many people you didn't do that.  If you look at the whole population, like the entire population, like a little light went off every time someone was shitting on someone's head. How many times that happened?  I bet you could fucking light up a small town. I know it's mostly the girls shitting on the guy's head.  Right. Would you imagine most of it is like a girl guy wanting a girl to shit on his head, mostly 100 percent.  I mean, look up if you look here's have you not see this?  Interesting, though, what I was going to say is it's it doesn't I don't feel bad at all about that.  Like, I don't feel like he's getting shit on. I feel like he wanted to get shit on and he got shit on. So I'm not mad at her at all. But if a guy was just on my thing like shit on woman's heads, I took her as a piece of garbage.  What the fuck, man are you doing that? And the girls, they just look, they want a thousand bucks. He wants to shit on their head. They make a deal and he just shits on people's heads. I would feel like that guy's disgusting. But the girl who shit on the guy's head. Obviously, the guy wanted it, the guy it's easier to think a guy wants to get his head shit on than a girl. Yeah, like a guy.  Like if you told me, hey, you know that guy that we used to be on that sitcom he likes, he pays girls to shit on his head.  I'm like, OK, that makes sense, dude.  I know how much it costs. I'm just kidding.  There is a market for right. Depends on how good you want her English to be. Yeah. There's some giant German lady who comes over and stomps on your head.  There's no negotiation. Like there's a dude who's actually had the conversation. He's like really like 2000 bucks. Like, Are you kidding? I never pay more than twelve hundred for someone to shit on my head.  Maybe they like they'll give a little extra if they let you know they're allowed to pick your diet and want you to own the Indian food.  Oh God. Just curry. Yeah. I want to smell the curry when you shit in my face. Have you seen those.  Have you seen those videos, the fetish videos of people who like to look at videos of people getting stuck in mud, you know, about that fetish.  So have you heard about that?  Oh, dude, it's like I don't know. Can we show that YouTube stuck in people minds?  My people are into people that get stuck in the mud.  Yeah, it's like a fetish, like it's like and there's all these videos of people like you fat.  I mean, like so the humans are stuck in mud, like walking and then someone comes along and fucks their mouth or something.  Well, no, no, it's just someone stuck in mud. Like at first you look at it and it looks like, why did that dude just throw himself in that swampy mud and then he gets out of the mud or they'll start just like wiggling around in the mud and like, yeah, it's.  Oh, my God, crazy. Well, OK, you're I buy something, but it's not it could be an illusion of car stock girls, but maybe not car stuff.  Girls that are stuck with their car like they need help and oh like a pawn. Someone needs help in there and a helpless position. Oh no. That's always a movie.  Right. The guys wait in the bushes with a gun and the girl standing there with her hood up and the guy runs out. Hey, give me a chance.  Yeah, it's on YouTube for this. I just. Sorry, man. I thought you were looking in like porn.  I don't think I typed and stuck in mud fetish videos.  And then there's a lot of like car forums like what's up with all these girls getting stuck in the mud?  What the fuck are they getting stuck in the mud with their legs?  No, no. It's like their automobile. Yeah, like a BMW.  The one I've seen is mostly primarily dudes. Like it's like, oh, guys get stuck in the mud, then other guys come out. There's no other guy. It's just like a guy like, you know, the Liberator pitch. Yes. It's just that. But with a like guy with abs. Oh my. He's like, oh he's they're yelling. They're just like, you know, like they're just stuck in mud. How weird. Yeah.  Yeah. People are so strange. It's a it's that fetish is a really interesting one. But I think any you know, you're kind of lucky if that's your fetish. Yeah. There's a lot of mud out there, man. It's like that's a that doesn't seem like a hurting anybody.  Yeah, no.  Unless you pay someone to go get stuck in mud and like they like sink down into quicksand or something ball.  Do you think that the people that are they fantasizing about themselves being stuck in mud. Don't know.  I don't know. Right. It's open to interpretation. It could be. They're just really into watching hot guys that get stuck.  Someone's filming it and they jerk off all the fucking loser, you know, mud, you fucking loser mud.  And there you go. Is that I don't know if this is one.  This is one hundred and thirty thousand views. And it says what you saw. One girl gets stuck in very sticky mud. Yeah. But, you know, it's like it's not like they're trying to get out.  That's a person she looks like the kind of girl that would just give up.  Like I think she's that stuck like, come on, you're not that I'm fucking stuck. I can't see it's done. Yeah, it's done. Yeah. How much do they pay her to do this. Fifty bucks. I don't know how much they have to pay you. How much do they pay me for my money.  If you wanted to do a mud video they wanted you to do a mud video like that for me. Just give me a good patch of mud. I'll go in a cute Asian girl.  Chinese girl gets stuck in mud with cute sneakers. Oh, no, she's got cute sneakers. She's going to walk right in the mud with those cute sneakers. Honey, those are valuable.  Yeah, well, are you doing. These are great, Jamie.  I haven't seen any of these. I'm an expert. We now there's so weird. Yeah. It's a weird it's a very strange fetish. I don't know if it's like maybe it's like an Asmar thing or something. Maybe, you know, maybe it's not even like sexual, it's just something in it. It's like relax dude. She took her shoes off. It's sexual. Yeah, that's true. She's got her feet.  She's moving around getting all squirt. You're a dirty girl with your dirty feet, dirty feet and yeah.  She's getting down the dirt. I lost a sock. Yeah, this is weird, weird, man. Imagine this is your whole life and you like to go on the forums. Yeah, that guy's got a new squishy feet in the mud video. Yeah, that be really weird, Joe.  So, Jamie, let's pull up something about the news. I mean, again, why here's a real question.  Here's where it goes and why is that so strange?  But like someone who collects stamps, that's normal, right? Some guy who loves oh, he's dressed up like a Nazi all the way back and he goes all the way to his fucking head.  Still smoking, too. It's like quicksand is in quicksand.  So that is this is a whole playlist of mass mud and quicksand.  You remember when people are terrified of quicksand and then it stopped being a thing. Now this there's a whole Radiolab podcast about that.  It's really interesting because you hear the podcast, you go, oh, yeah, I remember like people were scared of quicksand and then all of a sudden it went away.  I forget what the reasoning is. Well, when we were kids, that was like one of the ways you could die based on quicksand. And sometimes you it's like if you're out in the woods and there was a suspicious patch, you might even poke it with a stick because it's like, fuck, that's that was a whole trope in, like, all movies. Yeah. You know, like Tarzan stuck in the quicksand or you're in the quicksand and someone throws a vine that you pull yourself that something like 80 different movies.  Oh yeah.  What are you supposed to do if you were in quicksand. Supposed to treat like its water and swim. Right. I there's videos it Jamie says no go Jamie.  You quicksands know there's videos on I and if you can't stand the best thing to do is if your phone isn't fucked up, set it up to take a video and then send that video to I love my boys at Gmail dot com. It's my private email. I will come to you. I trust me. It seems like I will get to you, but I will come on you. I'll get you out. That easy thing.  I think you fall back, you have a service in your services, you get people out of the mud and you give them twelve hundred bucks, but you got to jerk off on their face while they're trying to get out of the mud. Yeah. You go out there with like big mud shoes, like snowshoes, but only for mud and you come out there and fucking whack went off in there. OK, all right. We're good. Deal's a deal.  Harness them up to a rope and hitch it to your winch and drag them out of the swamp.  Think of the battle and you give them money, though. Give me 12 bucks. Here's twelve hundred bucks. Thank you. But to me that's like that would be a great scene is like somebody does get stuck in quicksand and someone like they see boots and they're like, thank God, thank God.  And it is like a mud fetishist.  He's like, you know, like, no, I'll get to you, don't worry, I'm going to save you. But just, you know, enjoy it first.  What about this would have the fucking the real mud fetishes. They set up traps. So they made their own mud holes. They dug them real deep and use real silty, very fine sort of sand. Yeah.  So if you get in there, you slide right in like quicksand and they have traps, they have traps and they've got like a little camera trap, sends a text to their phone, says we got one, and then they start chewing on Viagra and start getting their dick hard and then they run, dude are like, like a spider.  You catch something, it's nasty, but you kind of fall in love with him, you know, and then you start dating them and then like but then then, you know, like all of a sudden you realize, like everyone they've dated, they've saved from quicksand.  And you begin, you're like, oh, they're doing our purpose.  You go into you looking for something like, does he have a flashlight to go through stuff here, look for a flashlight. He finds schematics for how to build the perfect sand pit.  You motherfucker, you trick me. This shows the water where the water's coming in to make the quicksand. You'll need this amount of water to capture two hundred pound man metrics based on weight.  That's what he likes. He wants to get like big burly, like firemen type dudes a jerk off on their hair. That's real.  Yeah, well, they're trapped. He knows maybe like he knows calls for specific types of people.  Like he knows little man KeyCorp.  Yeah. Yeah.  What that's dude. Have you ever done one of those like you've ever gone to a spa and in there like fuck I'm going to do like I'm going to get a massage. But then you see in their catalog they've got my dip, you can go into you that somehow healthy for you like you know what I mean. Like it's a considered like a healthy thing, you laying it up to your head. It's like, you know, I'm talking about man like it's like.  Yeah. So much. Yeah. You ever done one of those? No, I have not.  They're fucking amazing off dude.  I went in there like we, you know, I was with I brought a girl, my girlfriend, the spa and they made it look all romantic and shit.  It's like a couple's mud dip and like these, you know, there's like flower. Hours in between him and staff, and you see it in the picture and it looks somehow relaxing your brain party is like, how could that how's that can feel good. Like, it's like just sitting in mud, but it looks kind of cool. And, you know, I love getting started, getting massages. Like, I might be fun when your heart is be in mud.  We got in these fucking things. They're like next to each other and like, dude, like they don't no one they don't realize is stupid. That looks like it. Somehow they make it. Whoever's doing this shake is made. Try like see if you can make a fake you. This is a normal thing for a couple to do. And then also you realize they don't change the mind.  Oh I'm pretty sure they don't refill my dirt. Yeah. Yeah it's dirty. Yeah. Oh my God. Yeah. Yeah.  So the culture that came out of some dude's balls is all like mingling with your cultures and all that's breeding in the mud. Yeah, exactly dude.  And not only that, but like the ones that we were in, I don't know if they heated it wrong or whatever, but any time my ass touched like close to the bottom, it was burning my ass. So it's like the heater, the heater in the bottom was like burning my ass was having to do like this. I don't know what you call like arch my back tips.  Yeah. I was like doing dips in the mud and then it's fucking hot as fuck. So like my heart like starts racing also.  I'm like I was pretty high but I like to stick to my ass is like getting incinerated by this thing. And like God he went to a Jenky place.  I drank mud baths clock and that's actually the name of the place Jenckes Mud Bath Place.  Where does the expression Jenky come from go Jenky like a shitty clunky version that one might be racist.  Got to be careful. That might be one of them secret racist words. You didn't know it was racist.  You've been saying Jenky and they're like, well let me bring you back to the genocide of the Egham people and Jesus I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised.  What is the etymology of Janki. I've no idea. That's why I asked. Are you sure you don't know German? I definitely don't know.  I'm one hundred percent isn't. What do we got? He just dies. I just want to make sure that I'm not stepping over any boundaries by using Jenky because I want to be a good ally.  There's probably it's probably not connected. They just sounds like a word. It sounds like a bad word.  And I think it was close to junky. I go to Jenky, I'm trying through this quick and that does offend me.  But I don't like the term jenckes. Good jenckes look like you've got a car with a fucked up break.  You know, it's just fucking Jackie brake job that though only the 90s is like this. I might have invented it, but maybe if I did Jameses. It's African American slang from the 90s. Yeah, that makes sense. That makes sense.  Citations in 90s. Yeah. Yeah.  So who wrote that. Who wrote the article I'm looking at is like I mean, like not that I know that which is weird. Someone like we hear things like that, like, all right, that must be your first book.  They found it in first that this person wrote the article, said Russ The Longest War, written by Jonathan Waldman. Hmm.  By the way, I'm very much kidding. If it wasn't clear, I don't really think I made that word up. It says Joe can't find another one.  It's amazing how attuned you get to like comments that you like. Your brain is like you're nuts to want anybody to really.  I was thinking like that could be misinterpreted. That's my word. I created it.  What's another great word that they don't use anymore that I started using recently? Oh, fresh. I started using fresh lately.  I thought fresh, I must say, like that I don't say with a normal voice fresh, so it's like delux fresh. No, you don't use it when things are good, fresh, fresh.  Things are looking fresh. Oh, you get like, yeah, I hear it in the back. It gets like looks from my brodo. They're fresh. It's a good word. It's a good word.  We need more beautiful adjectives for cool shit. So I started bringing back fresh.  Hey what's what like what's your like policy when like about cursing around your kids like you know give up or give up.  You did. Yeah. I told them just don't swear, don't swear around other people.  There was too many times they caught me on the phone. Right. My nine year old especially. She's the one who's always correcting me.  Hey, watch your body language. She says that, yes, she's hilarious and she likes to correct me.  I try not to say as much as I would say with you, but every now and then I'll let a fuck word fly or a shit word fly.  But has to make sense, dude, the funniest story I realize I say too much when my daughter was three, we were we had gone skiing together and we were all packing up our stuff. And her helmet did not go in her. It wasn't in her bag. And I'm like, all right, everybody packed up. And I'm like, hey, your helmet and your bag. And she looks at the helmet, looks the bag.  She just goes, shit, just three. See, a little and me and my wife were just like, oh, no, I did it three, but that's the right word to use shit, what are we doing?  Like, we aren't even in that world. You and I are not even in that world like the world of you can't say words.  All right? You can't say that word at work. We don't even live in that world. And yet we're raising our kids for that world.  That seems to me to be a little crazy. And I understand, like, look, if I worked in an office somewhere or if I had to deal with people professionally, I wouldn't be dropping F bombs all day. You can't people get upset.  They don't like it. They want you to behave like a business person. They'll turn you in to human resources. If you have a funny joke about Puerto Ricans, you can't. You can't. There's no jokes. There's no laughter. You can't.  You got to.  So when you're telling your kids not to say certain words around other people, you're telling them that because you want them to be polite, you don't want people to feel uncomfortable, but you should never have them think that there's something wrong with those fucking where those words are important.  You know, I can't really explain it to them because I can't really say it the way I want to say it.  It would just be too sensitive. Like I couldn't say I can't say sometimes when someone's telling you something that you know isn't true and they're telling you you want to be able to look in the eye and go, hey, that guy's a fucking idiot.  I can't say that to a nine year old. Right. It's just too intense. Right. It's too intense. Right. Like, if you say this person's an idiot, that's one thing. But if you say this person's a fucking idiot, yeah, that's a different thing. It's another level of thing. And you need to know what's what, especially when the shit goes down. You need to know who's just a dummy and who's a fucking idiot.  Right? Right. Some guy just make mistakes or they think they know better or they do something stupid and it puts everybody at risk. Yeah, but they're not doing it on purpose. And there's some people who think they want to run the whole show. And those people are fucking idiots.  Certain people that steal from you, they'll break in your house when they know you're not home because people are fucking idiots.  Right.  I know you. Right? Yeah. This is a different level. And if we don't use the right words, so what do we do? We're going to limit a kid's ability to express themselves.  Right. The words aren't changing. They're not changing you. They're not change.  It's just another tool for expression and swear words like really swear words. You're going to stop using swear words, not going to make people upset about swear words.  Get the fuck out of here.  So ridiculous. Yeah. No, no, no. I know, man. I just like I get it. I that's like kind of my wife have decided that and like some of my friends or parents have also said, just teach them not to say those words, teach them to be nice that way, or when the right time to say those words is just like listening to like. Oh no. Like this morning I put on for no reason, like Ten Commandments and like I have my in like my my son was in the other room and like he comes walking in like he's just learning to dance.  And then I pick him up, he's laughing or dancing and I'm like, oh fuck, we're dancing to the Ten Commandments right now.  Like, he doesn't know what was being said, but you know what I mean? It's like, fuck, I don't know if I even even that even that even though he doesn't even the fact he probably hopefully doesn't understand at least hopefully does. I still like. Yeah, I don't know that it's like you're saying it's too much. The energy is too intense.  It's Yeah. It's very aggressive. Yeah. Yeah.  There's certain there's you know you don't you want to shelter them a little bit from the the the most dark shell.  You don't want to show your kid some murder movie like the opening scene of Saving Private Ryan when they're four, you know, once they sit down this is what happens when people go to war.  This is the closest that we have that represents what war is like, right in people's guts hanging out and legs blown off.  Yeah.  You're not going to show that before you ever. All right. Me neither. That's what it seems like if I act like I act with my friends around little kids.  So I, I, I pull it in a lot. A lot.  But occasionally I'll, I'll say, oh shit.  Sure. But I don't I just try to there's this words that. I don't want to lose, like and I the only reason why I think a lot of like these swear words, like the F word, the shit word or whatever, if you're at work and you can't say those, like, why not?  Like, what is that? What kind of job is that. Like what are we we're all the grown ups.  Now remember when we were children, we thought that there was a system that was put in place by enlightened beings and these enlightened beings, the adults, they knew better. We resisted, but we thought they eventually were correct. Yes. And then you get to be a certain age like, oh, that's nonsense. There's no adults. It's just people that got older. Right. They're just people. So as people that you have to limit your language, the only thing that's good is when someone who you don't expect to says, get the fuck out of here when they say it's even better.  Yeah, right.  Yeah. A woman that you would think would be like like very reserved, very professional. And she's like, that chick's a cunt like like.  Oh yeah. I love that. When you realize someone you thought was a square is not only not a square, but like a million times more out there than you are, but they're like they're trapped. Yeah. Or they're Kamo, they just have like, figured out a way to like not reveal to you or to the world that because they, they like understood. It's a little easier. People don't realize that unless you're uncool, cool people.  Those are the best moments when that window opens up and you realize, oh fuck man, I'm such a dope. I had you completely pegged as something that you're not at all. And those are really like, well, fuck, what's that come?  It's not real marijuana cough. I know, man. I hate I'm a hypochondriac, Joe. With allergies. Everybody is now I have allergies. I have seasonal allergies. And, you know, any time before this was happening, any time I would get sick, I'd be like, well, this might be the end. And now, like all of us who are like that, we're like it's really intense, man, because like any demonstration, you know, my birthday was the other day we got like, you know, they deliver booze in L.A. now, like they'll deliver mixed drinks to you now.  And that's how we deliver bullets.  You have your bullets brought to your door now. Hopefully not too fast. I'm sorry, a quick bullet delivery, but yeah. Anyway, man, like like I always just hung over, you know, but there there is a moment where I'm like, is this a hangover? Am I there? Is this like what's this headache? And you know, what's that's the to me that's the part of this thing is, you know, I don't I haven't seen it yet.  Acknowledge that much is like just the psychological pressure of what's going on.  I like the way it's got to be like, you know, just psychologically like I think all the people you and I know who are already teetering at the very edge of sanity and like imagine them alone in an apartment for a month with, like, the news telling them, we don't know when we can let you out, like, whoa, how many people are, like, really losing their shit and like, I'm not losing my shit, but at least a couple of times a day I'll have a real claustrophobic moment.  Like, I can't explain it. It's like a I don't know if it's a panic attack.  It's not just like this sense of like, oh, this fucking sucks. I don't want to drive by Trader Joe's and see people wearing face masks with six feet in between each of them and the fucking weirdness of it all. People are driving weird right now and it's just like, what the fuck? People are driving weird. Yeah, real aggressive. Yeah. Man, that that that that you know, I don't people I don't think are dodging the fact that and they need to that if you're feeling if you're feeling a little off right now that's normal.  Like you probably should acknowledge that, you know, or at least like otherwise people are going to start thinking they're really going nuts when it's like now you just have some kind of like probably a new mental illness will be. They'll probably a new name for a covert related mental illness, you know, like pandemic associated claustrophobia syndrome or some shit like, you know, some like thing. That is a new thing because we've never had to do this.  But of course, 100 percent. Yeah. I mean, do you know how many people are going to get sued for this? Do you know, I mean, how many people are going to sue the government for the closed down? You know, many people are going to go crazy and yeah, how many businesses are going to be lost? I mean, lives are turned upside down.  How many people fuck man divorces? Oh, my God. So many. Yeah, dude, so many.  You know, people forced in these high pressure situations they didn't anticipate. And then some people falling apart, people with drug problems accelerate because they need to relieve the anxiety from all this.  Yeah, man. And we're just beginning it, man.  I mean, just we're we're still three weeks away from at least here with this state is going to open up, right.  May fifteenth.  Yeah, but what do you think is going to happen in Georgia, do you think when they when they open Georgia back up, you're going to get like another another series of people that have it?  I don't think it's going to be. What do you think?  If you had a yes man, that's a price. I have no doubt all the data sources are some of them are so very different. It seems like. Yeah. That it's like, you know, you have people who've won Nobel Prizes, you know, saying what they think it is and you have other people who are doctors saying what they think it is. And those things don't quite match to the point where it comes down to it's not like what I think's going to happen.  It's what I hope is going to happen, which is like that. It just not only that the curve keeps flattening, maybe not necessarily, maybe because it's mutating, maybe because herd immunity, maybe because, you know, I don't know who to believe. You turn on FOX News, you see one story, you turn on CNN, you see the other story. You go on the Internet. It's a fucking media war that's going to hit you go.  You know, it depends on who you're talking to.  An RPG five 5G, you know, a variety of things have a low level bioweapon that's being combined with a horrific, like, powerful psy ops operation. Who the fuck knows, Joe?  We don't know. So it's like the the that to me is the the real unnerving quality of this outside of worrying, like, if you go outside, like every time you cough, I'm like, mother fucker, I should wear my mask. I'm doomed when my wife sees that she's going to fucking kill my ass. But like that, you know, just that those moments that would normally just go completely unnoticed. I like those those to me, that new reality, they get highlighted.  Yeah.  And brother that that is like that's another form of virus. It's fear and it's paranoia and it's like it's a it's a meme that spreads.  So it changes your outlook, it changes the way you interact with life, changes your outlook and it changes, it changes the actual course of your life. Like you'll you'll be operating with fear and operating with anxiety. And everyone's thrust into that without anything bad that they've done that for no fault of their own.  They're thrust into the situation where even though they've worked really hard, they've been really disciplined, they've done the right thing, they've been conservative. They take care of their health all the all the all the checks, everything. But still also in work goes away. Yeah. For everybody. Yeah.  Nobody did anything wrong. So everybody's thrust into this situation. It's really the ultimate haves and have nots moment, you know.  And it's for what's really interesting is like right when Bernie Sanders just stepped out of the race, like this is the example of why we need some sort of comprehensive plan for everybody if everything goes wrong.  Yeah, man, this is right. Right here. I do. The capitalism moves the world. Yes. Does I mean, it seems to motivate most of what we do, but the idea that there's there's not more that we can do for the people of the community of of the United States of America as a community, is that health care and education and stop people from being robbed, like stop, stop some predatory lending, stop all these things that you can clearly see people are just getting fucked over from.  Yeah. Spend more money on health care. Like we need that now. Yeah. We went through a nice, sweet spot where there was no real problems other than occasional little blips, bad flus and bad diseases. And we squashed them real quick. This is a big one that hit the hole.  And this is only, you know, as far as like terrible pandemics, the amount of people that it kills per people that get it is not as high as it is for some of the more horrendous diseases we got.  Lucky. We should prepare for the worst. We should prepare for airborne Ebola. We should prepare for all that shit. We should think about it the way we think about arms races, how much money they put it into the military and how much money they put into the the war against viruses. Well, the war against viruses just killed fifty thousand people at home. Imagine if China just had just launched missiles into American cities and killed fifty thousand people would be at fucking war.  All of our resources would be dedicated to that. Right. Right. Well, why aren't all of our resources being dedicated to fighting off fucking diseases like viruses?  This is a real wake up call for that. It's also a wake up call for powergrid people, people that are worried about the power grid go down. It's a wake up call for people that haven't had food stockpiled in their house. Wake up call for people that are living extended. You know, like they've really extended their reach as far as the how much the rent is and how much their car payment is. And they're really stretching it.  Well, boom, something like this happens and you're you're never going to play catch up. We're barely keeping up with your lifestyle before all this went down. Yeah. And again, through no fault of your own. So you got to kind of prepare now. People are going to have to look at this like, OK, now we know something can happen that we never thought could happen before in the whole world shuts down. Yeah. Now we know that's it.  But we should we should act accordingly and like how we run things now we know.  Well, that's the silver lining. I mean, like that's the silver line. It's like when you have a thing happen that you realize, like, you know, whatever, like in your car, you get lucky and you notice that the tire is like super flat and you fill it up. You just didn't notice or whatever. You see a thing and it saves you from a later fucking thing. That could have been a million times worse. But, you know, man, the wake up call to me is like, it's no joke that you need to at least be on, like, some terms with your neighbors.  And it's no joke that you need to understand how to do like how to grow food out of the ground. And it's like basic first aid and stuff like that. And also to always have gas in your car, ma'am, like, you know, we the other day went to get groceries and like, fucking the, you know, left a credit card at the house. Right. And like the car. But the car was kind of low on fuel because I hadn't gas it up like I should have.  Right. And the combination of suddenly not being able to put gas in the car and these two dumb mistakes, it wasn't just a normal, shitty day where your car runs out of gas. Now it's your car's run out of gas during a pandemic, meaning you got to call somebody to come and get put gas in your car or walk somewhere to get gas. That's a whole different walk than before. And that's asking someone to come and help you is kind of like asking them, hey, would you mind like taking a chance?  I mean, I know you're wearing a mask and everything, but you know what I mean. So suddenly fuckups in this kind of environment, they mean a lot more than fuckups in like the previous world that we are in. And that's teaching me a real kind of responsibility, you know, like having some cash on hand, like stuff like that.  Like, yeah.  What we you know, we should always be doing that. And to me, that is one of the you know, and I hate using everything using the term silver lining right now. And it's like anytime you say I like. Yeah, it's a silver lining on like people drowned in their own fucking mucus. It's not you know, it's fucked up.  But I guess one of the silver linings in it is just that the fact that it's like, look, man, Trump just was talking about maybe we should inject ourselves with Lysol.  OK, go crazy. That video. Have you seen the.  Well, when they focus on the lady who's a science adviser and she's sitting there listening to him say, oh, yeah, yeah, I have seen I've seen Paris tweeted it, it it's it's sad when you look into the abyss, the abyss looks it to you.  I think that's it. You know, and also in that look, you know, I saw I saw her thinking, like, listen, motherfuckers, who's in line? You want to have you want this job? I'm doing what I can to steer this crazy ship as best as I fucking can. And there's not much I could do. But it's like, you know, you see somebody seriously say to an entire planet, it might be a good idea to inject Lysol into your bodies here.  Let's hear it. Let me hear. Start from the beginning. I think you got to actually double click on it on my computer, I had to to get the sound out of it. Nothing. You hear that whisper? No, I don't hear those, Duncan. That was me. It's all dead anyway.  Bottom line is, he's saying wacky shit and the focus is on this lady and she's watching him. She's like, I can't even fucking believe I have to handle this.  Yeah.  And she does that to me. I to get the disinfectant into the body, that's maybe possible. We could get him to drink Lysol. Quite powerful. I could use light till it's from outside or inside. I don't know how you do it. There you go.  Because you see a thing like that and it's like, OK, lean into that. Like that's going to like lean into that is the thing that you can count on. That's the thing saying inject lighter. That's the kind of thing where like in your crazy friend, if they said that to you, you would be considering like calling their their friends or their mom to be like, hey, Jack, he's having like a hardcore manic episode. He's talking about injecting himself.  You better do something that's the fucking president. And to me, what that tells me is like, motherfucker, you need gas in your car. You need to make sure your phone is juiced up, you know what I mean? You need to make sure that you are like you got to be ready. You got to be ready. Because if we think we're going to lean into some, like, imaginary hammock made of like people who are saying that we should inject ourselves with Lysol, then we're then that's our fault.  That's your because, you know, it's like let's imagine let's say you went and you I don't know, you went into the forest and you got attacked by a tiger. But right before you went in the tiger, you go into the forest, you said to somebody, hey, do you think I should go in that forest? Tiger's there in there like, no. And then they start shooting up with Lysol, you know what I mean?  If you go in that forest and the tiger gets you, that's your fault. You fucking listen to a dude. He thought you could shoot up Lysol.  You know what I mean?  That's your imagine.  What was he thinking while he was saying that he's probably like this got to be an intelligent way to get out of this fucking subject that I've already started and I've already like coming up with. Perhaps, for instance, maybe you could. Maybe you could.  So supposing we hit somebody with a tremendous whether it's ultraviolet or just very powerful light.  And I think you awful light that has a magic that we're going to test it. And then I said we're inside the body. You can which you can do either through the skin or in some other way. And I think you said you're going to test that, too, was interesting to put. Right. And then I see the disinfectant with knocks it out in a minute. One minute. And is there a way we can do something like go by injection inside or almost a cleaning?  Because you see it gets so it'll be interesting. Yeah. How long can we take your lungs out and down, put your lungs through a car wash. Like what. Yeah, what a crazy thing to say.  I mean cleaning, cleaning. Give him a cleaning. Yeah.  Imagine like being his doctor and you have to listen to him say this like so why don't you do like the, the disinfectant. You know, inside is like a cleaning. You did my liver bleach.  Can you take my liver out and just knowing your way of it. Yeah. You know, so to me you see that and it's like, OK, well, I'm not quite certain that that is where I'm going to get my data stream from because that's a lifestyle person. And then but then we but then there must be like a thing we can do, regardless of the fact that clearly you wouldn't even talk like that on a podcast.  I would never say that.  But about imagine imagine you have zero expertise in a certain subject. You talking to someone who's like some expert. Yeah.  In this said subject and you're proposing these outlandish like you're on a podium, you don't even have an up a private conversation. Yeah. In front of everybody. You're somehow having a side conversation where you're proposing these ridiculous ideas that show that you don't understand how disinfectant works. Why why is that even conversation even taking place?  Also, the other thing is because he did ask the question that is it time for someone on that side of the room to go, no looking.  You can't do that.  But she knows if she interrupts him and goes, what? You can't do that. You can't inject this infection, he'd probably be upset. And she wants to do the best work that she can do. And this is just some nonsense she has to handle along the way.  Wow. Yeah. Yeah, it's just a bad path. Hey, look, first of all, I mean, look, the guy works some ungodly amount of hours a day, right? He's going to do some dumb shit like and he wings it.  A lot, right? He probably was stuck on that conversation of things that might be able to be done and maybe you could do strong, ultraviolent light like in the skin then also it's like, oh, my God, I'm I'm laying out. Possible ways that you could cure this, they're going to keep going, I better have more than one. Yeah, and there's like a disinfectant. That's right. Disinfectant, disinfectant, maybe inside or outside. They have a way of doing that.  Yeah. And then he say and then he goes to her like he's looking for support, like I think you said maybe. I think you said maybe you look into this.  Yeah man. I mean it definitely has that sense. Like when you had to give a report at school and prepare for. Yeah, that's it. That's exactly what it's like. Well, who were the Syrian rebels?  Well, they were from Syria. Yeah.  Yeah, they were. They were rebels. Yes.  And I heard they were tremendous rebels. They were fighters.  They fought and they fought long and hard in Syria, in areas around Syria.  And some people in areas around Syria referred to them as rebels and said they were some of the most intense rebels in the region. So as Syria, it's a different place.  You, Duncan, you wrote a report about the wrong place, a Syrian. I was saying that you heard me wrong.  Oh, yeah. You just heard me wrong.  I can't give you an A. Yeah, man, there's like how many times did you bullshit your way through, like those things in high school? Almost every day. Every day. A lot of a lot of the times, man. I mean, I got like I think it was the Red Badge of courage, which even now I can't remember. What if it's I think it's about the Revolutionary War. And I believe that I didn't read it all clearly.  I didn't read it because I still can't remember which war it was about. But I remember just having not read the book at all, having to write a report on it or I think I said it in Vietnam or something like that, and maybe was a civil war and that she was just like, that's not even the war that it was that happened, that, you know, I completely failed, like and not one of those one of those F's where the teachers are angry.  Kalvin Yeah. Yeah.  I found out about Cliff Notes when I was in high school. I couldn't believe it. Mike, this is a gift from God. Yeah. Cliff Notes just got to buy it on your own. You got to buy the book, but it's a way you can read it in an hour. That's really fucked.  But it still sucked. You had to pay money for a cliff. I mean.  Yeah, but I thought it was cheating. It was like a cheating, though. They're giving you a way to like this is not so you can learn better to seek good pass test. Right. That's this is so you give me like. Oh yeah. And then like you said to her, get off my fucking stuff. That's page thirty. That's yeah.  There's a little gray area a few years ago where kids could just copy and paste other people's reports for from years past because they were all digital and teachers didn't know this was a thing they could check.  They had no checking tools to find out plagiarism and whatnot.  But oh my gosh, so many kids probably for a few years, just literally nothing, I'm sure, disaster that I'm sure you get out of school, you graduate high school, you can't read like what you can't read.  I have not made any I can't just play video games. I can read a little bit of video games. Yeah.  I just made my way through. Well, I mean, you know, there's like that's one of them. Isn't that now the people who went to recently went to jail for like bribe for getting their kids into college. Oh yeah. It's kind of a version of the accent with your kids. Right. You're like you're like just their kids aren't aren't supposed to be in college because they haven't done any work in high school and they don't know what they're doing.  But if you pay enough money, you get them in there. It's like and also aren't they doing some thing where they get people to go and take SATs for your kid? Like you figure out a way to like it's an identity theft thing, or you can even get someone to go on, like do the test as your kid using fake ID and shit. So it's like you send in an operative that isn't your kid. Take the test so you can get into a nice school.  Mmm. That whole thing was so crazy, they spent so much money to get kids in school but didn't want to be good students.  Yeah, that's right.  Almost like you think you could buy by kids way to enthusiastic focus that.  Well, there you go.  I mean, there's the whole problem is that this was this is from the district attorney's office in Massachusetts, one of the photos that was used to show this girl's rowing, former high school rowing career that she got a scholarship on.  That's a workout machine. Oh, wow. That was supposed to be like, yeah, look at her intervarsity. Oh, fuck, man. What?  Wow. So there was no photos of her actually rowing out on a boat.  That's part of the thing.  Like having people take tests. They went and staged photos to be like, look, the oh my God. It's all allegedly, according to the court.  But imagine how mad real rowers would be at you if they found out you got a scholarship based on a fucking rowing machine photo.  Wait, wait.  So, man, was it for scholarships or was it just trying to get them in China just to get in? I don't think they got scholarships. No.  But to be on the rowing team, you know, or whatever it's called, I forget I've talked to is it like good for your GPA or some shit?  It's a way to get in. Oh, way to get in. Yeah. Oh, right.  So that end the bri extracurricular activity kind of stuff on your record.  So they just they fudged that and then bribed the rest of it. Do you think the kids knew.  Yeah. Yeah, you you know, when your parents like, hey, we just bought this rowing machine, why just don't worry about it. We're just going to take a picture of you in a rowing machine like. Sure. You know, you're getting a picture taken of you to try to get you into this school that your dad went to or whatever. You're complicit to some degree. Like, yeah, you have to be like, yeah, yeah, a little bit.  Go to that picture. She doesn't even broke sweat has a face covered up, so you can't see what I want to see close in on that. She didn't look sweaty to me. Crew is the word. She looks like she's barely started exercising that one down here to. Yeah, come on, son, I don't see no sweat, that's a better one, because, look, stop, go up. Look at that. That's a gray sweater.  Gray T-shirt, gray T-shirts. Look sweaty instantly. Yeah, instantly call.  This is hilarious. I pulled it back a couple of times and my duniya. You can't even get me in to see a fucking loser. My father's a loser and he takes pills.  Yeah, no shit, dude. I want you to love me.  Well, get me in a fucking UFC.  All my friends are going, dude, that thing that's really fucked up is like there's some kid whose parents like like are making 20 a year who's working his fucking ass off, you know, like just like somehow managing to, like, study nonstop to try to get into a good school. It doesn't get into the school because of that shit. That's the that's the satanic part is like they buy their way in and that's someone's place to have a limited number of places, meaning like theoretically someone doesn't get into the school who could be the person who is going to, you know, invent teleportation or some shit.  Isn't that weird?  What schools are you have your first choice. Second choice because third choice. Fuck yeah. Fuck Billy's going on.  Where's are you going? South Dakota. What's in South Dakota, yeah, flat ground, did I get it, though, I mean, I get wanting to get into some Ivy League, I guess Illuminati school.  I think that be cool, especially if you're in if you're in the Illuminati and your kid's a dope shit, that's not so bad. You're in the Illuminati with an embarrassing kid. And if you like, like, I don't I don't swear that much about my kids.  My kids don't know how I talk around my friends. What if that's how it is with, like, Illuminati, too? Like these kids don't even know their parents were in the Illuminati. Yeah. You know, and you're like, look, I'm trying to get you to be in a better position in life. But I was working all the time. I wasn't around. I didn't push you hard enough. Now, sure they got you into Yale.  Are they fucking know you're in it and they're just like you're like, did you get into my fucking Audrina Crome again?  They're like breaking into your vaults, you know, taking your fucking, like, goblets of blood and drinking at parties.  Don't drink any more of my blood. You have to stop this, you know, like join them in the skull and bones.  Don't they bring their kids to Skull and Bones? I don't think so. I think they do.  I think they once they're there in the sun turns 30 as a sun.  I'm going to show you something. And they take them, take them to the skull and bones, you to bring them in.  Now, if you go to school there, you get into it. Right. That's how you I think that's how you get in the school. That's how you get in stuff. Right.  Legacy is that I get in or is that how you get in Skull and Bones. Like I would not want. I don't think the whole school gets to be skull and bones, but that's how you get accepted is what I meant.  That's how you get into the school. Isn't that funny? Like if you're in a place like Yale, which is very exclusive and very prestigious already some creeps like that's not enough. I want to get in the secret cult dick sac in society. What do they do? They don't suck dicks, do they? Will.  You know, it wasn't a rumor that they make each other, blow each other, take photos of it so that they they have something over them. That was what's one of the crazy online conspiracy theories, right? Yeah. They they make every guy suck a dick and they take Polaroids of it. And so they always have it. They hold over you.  I think that's just fraternity stuff. But yeah. Is that normal fraternity stuff. Berts talked about that right thing. Whatever for it.  Yeah. They would jerk off on a biscuit. Right. Yeah. That's the circle jerk thing. And the last guy to come had to eat the biscuit.  No one's really doing except for the one idiot that yeah.  One guy can't come because it's just jerking off all the time and he just go yeah I sucked a bunch of my friend's dicks. He was fucking cares. I mean are we in a time now where like like a picture of me emerges sucking all my friends dicks.  I think there's more to it. So I think they Pegu or something and they take pictures wearing a strapon. So you got pegged. Yeah.  Well some people don't want to but you know, they want to rise through the branch that Raytheon gets to the top.  Everyone at Raytheon gets pegged like, wow, you know, that's just like fuck it, work. Yeah, we all get pegged now. So what, we're inventing bombs now, you know, like, who cares? Of course we get pegged. Yeah, but the guys, we're a ghost costume. So what?  I like to wear a gold costume when I get pegged, I like too much kinky shit. It's like, God damn it, I hope we get to a time where, like, they take pictures of someone doing a fucking thing that's legit fucked up so that, you know, and they get banished for it. It's like, God forbid, like I can't even imagine the Polaroids that can emerge of weird shit I've done. You know, I could only imagine.  You can't imagine. I can't. But that being said, it's like, yeah, I wonder what I think, what the initiation. I get it like it is it. Look, let's face it, you're not going to probably be fun to be a part of a little tiny group.  That's a part of an exclusive group. Right. You got the exclusive group that's Yale and then you get the little skull and bones. We all get together, all brothers in the room.  You know, they probably have like secret wars, they have to say and lie and shit.  Yeah, I mean, we that's the thing that I imagine based on the way I have come to understand things, whatever it is, is way more boring than we imagine. Because you know what I be like when you don't know what the thing is. You always project the worst thing on. My guess is it's boring as fuck. It's probably just some college bullshit where people are in a frat sit around and, like, make dumb jokes and do stupid shit and it's nothing and probably don't even Pegu, they probably just take a Polaroid of your asshole.  Got it. Look, we got your mouth shut. Yeah. We finally asshole. It's your son's fingerprint.  Don't show anybody else.  Fingerprint your asshole told a lot about you.  That stuff. You look at a person's eyes, you know, and you see their soul.  It's the windows to the soul.  What if the asshole is like you really know whether you like someone just by looking at their ass or something about the asshole tells you things.  Books come out decoding your asshole. Now, like people read hands, they read fingerprints. You can't they read assholes. I bet assholes tell you a lot just like someone's eyebrows do. Someone's got like mean eyebrows like, whoa, I Coke's aggressive.  I don't feel guys got big, thick, bushy eyebrows. And he's not mean I get suspicious, he's all friendly with the big, crazy fucking eyebrows, but all the villains have big crazy eyebrows.  They're all angry. Those crazy eyebrows.  Yeah. Yeah. It's just like mad for one year, probably for sure. We don't know that you can't tell a person's future from their asshole. Because. No, I thought of it.  That could be the new thing that people pick up as a business during this pandemic. Yeah. Asshole reading. Yeah.  Or what if it's like what if it's like there's an app SCANA Skin Scan, QR code.  Your asshole forgot to do a QR code. All this time we've been looking for alien signals from space.  We didn't know it was in our assholes.  Yeah, it was all of the photos of our assholes. If you put them together on a grid, it gives us the diagram of how to build a spaceship to get out of here.  I mean, you have to have all the photos. It's like a giant jigsaw puzzle with eight billion pieces. You take eight billion assholes and you put them on a grid and you'll see the schematics. Behold, it'll tell us exactly when the sun going to supernova. About 50 years maybe.  What if that's what the quantum computer, the first thing it says is I need pictures of all the assholes on the planet like.  But if you vote, you have to show photo your asshole before you vote.  You have to have it on your phone. That's your thing.  No, no. Thumbprints are not exact.  Assholes are exact, exact, and they don't get changed by workout's or they don't like, you know, you thumb your hands, get bigger, be a little bit different.  How do you know? I don't know that assholes don't get change from workout's. Well, they can. One thing they could do with your thumbprint. Right. Some people burn their prints off. You can't really burn.  We I guess you could burn the your asshole into an unreadable that's one of the CIA in your ass.  So I can't get a good relationship. People keep brut my asshole wrong.  Look, I'm more than my asshole. Let's end with that.  We just did three and a half hours. Oh, shit, man. Crazy. It's four o'clock already.  Listen, man, your show looks amazing.
